Specifically, the present invention relates to a novel method of predicting tumor initiation, tumor progression and/or carcinomas, the method comprising detecting genetic abnormality associated with tumors of epithelial origin. The present invention further relates to a novel method of identifying an individual with potential for developing carcinoma, the method comprising detection of genetic abnormalities. The present invention also relates to a method of predicting the progression of carcinomas and the transformation thereof to an aggressive variant, the method comprising detection of genetic abnormalities, which indicate the probability to develop carcinoma. The present invention also relates to a use of specific chromosomal region, a gene or a fragment thereof, and/or genetic markers for predicting tumor initiation, tumor progression and/or carcinoma. The present invention also relates to a use of specific chromosomal region or a gene or a fragment thereof in therapy, for the development of therapy and for the preparation of a medicament for treating tumors of epithelial origin.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCancer is a complex disease in which several genetic and epigenetic abnormalities have accumulated. A varying number of genetic changes are needed prior to occurrence of a somatically developed tumor. Available data indicate that the development of solid tumors is dependent on combination of deletions and amplifications of multiple chromosome segments (Mertens et al. Cancer Res 57: 2765-2780, 1997; Mitelman et al. Nature Genet, 15: 417-474, 1997). Over 90% of all human neoplasia is derived from epithelia. Thus, epithelial cells play an important role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Carcinomas are malignant tumors derived from epithelial cells. The most common carcinomas include the common forms of breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide with an estimated one million new cases annually (Parkin et al. CA Cancer J Clin 55: 74-108, 2005). The average lifetime risk in industrialized countries is approximately 5%, and almost half of those affected will die of their disease (Burt, Gastroenterology 119: 837-853, 2000). Colorectal cancer develops via a benign precursor lesion, polyp, and is preventable through polypectomy. It is estimated that 30% of the population have colonic polyps, and the incidence of polyps increases with age. Thus, screening colonoscopies in average asymptomatic individuals have revealed neoplastic (adenomatous) polyps in 12% of individuals of 40-49 years of age (Imperiale T F et al. NEJM 346: 1781-1785, 2002), and in 58% among 50-59 year-old individuals (Mehran A et al. Surg Endosc 17: 1974-1977, 2003). Certain inherited disorders, which account for some 5-10% of the total colorectal cancer burden, are associated with an increased number of polyps (familial adenomatous polyposis, FAP) or an elevated tendency to malignant progression (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) (Lynch and de la Chapelle, N Engl J Med 348: 919-932, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurvival is closely related to the stage at diagnosis, even in patients who have already developed malignant disease: over 90% of patients with local cancer are alive after 5 years as opposed to less than 10% of those with metastatic disease (Burt, Gastroenterology 119: 837-853, 2000). Colorectal carcinomas are notoriously resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy and most patients for whom surgery alone is not curative are doomed to die of their disease (Globcan, International Agency for Research on Cancer. Available at http:/www-dep.iarc.fr/, 2002). It is therefore vital to be able to identify individuals with an increased risk as early as possible to enable efficient cancer prevention or curative treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColorectal cancer development via benign precursors along with the accumulation of genetic changes is one of the best-known examples of multistep carcinogenesis (Chung D C, Gastroenterology 119: 854-865, 2000, and below). This multistep evolutionary nature of colorectal cancer provides excellent opportunities for early cancer detection and prevention. Colorectal cancers arise as a result of stepwise accumulation of mutations at the nucleotide level and/or at the gross chromosomal level. The overwhelming majority of colorectal cancers display one of the two major genomic instability phenotypes, microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosomal instability (CIN) (Abdel-Rahman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 2538-2543, 2001). The current literature includes a multitude of biomarkers of potential use in colorectal cancer risk assessment or early detection of this cancer; however, clinical validation is mostly lacking (Umar and Srivastava, Dis Markers 20: 87-96, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently, histology serves as a main predictor, with multiplicity of adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, villous features, and large size (over 1 cm), for increased cancer risk (Winawer et al. Gastroenterology 130: 1872-1885, 2006). Therefore, predictors of advanced pathology would be useful, for both adenomas and cancer, to be able to assign an appropriate risk category for each patient. Biomarkers that could serve as predictors of a tendency to cancer progress would be highly welcome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with approximately 1.2 million deaths annually (Ferlay et al. 2001, GLOBOCAN2000: Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide, Version 1.0 IARC CancerBase No. 5. Lyon, IARCPress). Up to 95 percent of lung cancers are smoking related and thus, DNA adducts have a key role in carcinogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients suffering of lung cancer often have poor prognosis, five-year-survival rates ranging from approximately 50% to 10% (Hasleton P S, Respiratory system 1.0 in Cancer Handbook. http:www.cancerhandbook.net, London: Nature Publishing Group, 2001). However, when lung cancer is detected in an early-stage and surgery is possible, the five-year survival rates can reach 85%. Thus, predictors of tumor initiation and/or progression would be valuable, in order to enable effective cancer prevention or therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMalignancies of the lung can be divided based on the histological characteristics into small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the latter consisting mainly of epidermoid carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Recent studies have shown the genetic background to be different among these cancer types (Kaminski at al. Chest 125 (5 Suppl): 111S-5S, 2004, Fong at al. Thorax 58: 892-900, 2003). However, it is assumed that over 20 genetic or epigenetic abnormalities are needed before clinically evident lung cancer. Typically, in lung carcinomas, multiple chromosome aberrations can be observed indicating genomic instability. Novel tumor markers would explain the pathogenesis of cancer and therefore, improve the effect of therapies and survival in lung cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnostics longs for single markers or a panel of markers for general screening of cancers. For example, prostate specific antigen (PSA) is secreted by the cells of the prostate gland and elevated levels of PSA are used as a marker for prostate tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral other markers for epithelial tumors are available but their use is hampered from their nonspecificity: These markers are often elevated also in other conditions than malignancy, such as in inflammatory lesions. Such markers, that have been used in the clinics but that do not meet the requirement of specificity and/or sensitivity are, for instance the following: tumor-derived colon-specific antigen (tCSA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), pregnancy-specific beta-glycoprotein 1 (SP1), human placental lactogen (HPL), human beta chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-HCG), transferrin (TF) and ferritin (FE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is of highest importance to develop new methods, which enable early identification of patients with an increased risk to develop aggressive carcinoma to enable efficient cancer prevention. There is also a need for a clinically useful method that could serve as a predictor of a carcinoma progressing tendency. Also, additional means for the development of new guidelines for the initiation and follow-up of cancer therapy are greatly needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChromosome 12q21 aberrations, specifically neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) gene aberrations, have been identified in neuroblastomas and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Four of 10 primary neuroblastomas studied by Coy et al. showed reduced or absent expression of NAV3, and three of them had homozygous deletions of both alleles (Coy J F at al. Gene 290: 73-94, 2002). In CTCL, a deletion or a translocation of NAV3 gene was associated with a point mutation in the remaining allele only in one of 7 patients studied (Karenko L et al. Cancer Res 65: 8101-8110, 2005 and EP1476567 A1). In pancreatic carcinomas, chromosome 12q21 aberrations were identified by microsatellite analysis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected with markers D12S1684 and D12S1708, which border a chromosomal region comprising NAV3 gene (Kimura M at al. Cancer Res 58: 2456-60, 1998). However, the chromosomal region described in the article by Kimura at al. is large and neither the specific region nor the NAV3 gene was observed to be linked to pancreatic carcinoma. On the contrary, this application describes chromosomal abnormalities that are specific for tumors of epithelial origin, in the specific chromosomal region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovel biomarkers for providing more effective and early diagnosis of potentially aggressive tumors as well as identifying tumors susceptible to targeted therapies are warranted. The present invention provides one solution for predicting or identifying tumor and carcinoma progression. The present invention also discloses a tool for evaluating clinical aggressiveness of epithelial tumors and patient survival. Furthermore, the invention provides a new therapeutic target for carcinoma prevention or therapy.\n\n\n \nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe object of the invention is thus to provide novel methods and means for diagnosing, staging and monitoring of patients having cancer, such methods and means allowing an early diagnosis of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother object of the invention is to provide novel methods and means for predicting tumor initiation, tumor progression and/or carcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother object of the invention is to provide novel methods and means for identification of individuals with an increased risk to develop carcinomas, such methods and means being specific and reliable and allowing identification as early as possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another object of the invention is to provide novel methods and means for the prediction of the progression of carcinomas and the transformation to an aggressive form, such methods and means allowing a timely therapeutic intervention, which may be life-saving.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another object of the invention is to provide novel methods and means for the development of new guidelines for the initiation and follow-up of therapeutic interventions as well as for the development of new treatment modalities for cancers, such methods and means prolonging the remission stage of the disease and introducing new possibilities for combating the disease and for the recovery of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another object of the invention is to provide novel biomarkers useful in early detection of the cancer as well as cancer risk assessment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel method for prediction of tumor initiation, tumor progression and/or carcinomas, characterized by detecting the presence or the absence of genetic abnormalities at 12q21.1-q21.31, specifically 12q21.2, the presence of said genetic abnormalities being associated with tumors of epithelial origin, in a biological sample.

In other words, the epithelial tumor is a colon tumor, rectum tumor, lung tumor, urinary bladder tumor, breast tumor, squamous cell tumor or a basal cell tumor. In the large intestine, the colorectal tumors can be either adenocarcinomas or premalignant adenomas or polyps, in the urinary bladder the tumor can be transitional epithelial polyps with poor differentiation or overt transitional carcinomas, the breast tumors can be either ductal carcinomas or acinar carcinomas and in the skin, the tumors can be either basaliomas or epidermoid carcinomas (also called squamous cell carcinoma or spinocellular carcinoma). In the lung, the tumor can be either epidermoid carcinoma or adenocarcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the method of the invention the genetic abnormalities are determined by the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of NAV3 gene or a fragment thereof, wherein LOH of NAV3 is indicative of tumor progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the method of the invention the genetic abnormalities of NAV3 gene are determined in haploid, diploid and/or polyploid cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the method of the invention the tumor cells are microsatellite stable (MSS) or microsatellite instable (MSI).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the method of the invention the tumor of epithelial origin is other than carcinoma of pancreas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also based to the use of chromosomal region 12q21.1-q21.31, specifically 12q21.2, NAV3 gene or a fragment thereof, and/or markers at 12q21.1-q21.31, specifically 12q21.2, associated with tumors of epithelial origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment the markers at 12q21.1-q21.31 include D12S1684, D12S326, D12S1708 and/or rs1852464.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment the markers at 12q21.2 include D12S326 and/or rs1852464.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “genetic abnormality” refers to the presence of a translocation, deletion, amplification, inversion or another defect at 12q21.1-q21.31, specifically at 12q21.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “deletion” refers to the absence of a nucleotide or nucleotides and/or an exon or exons in the gene sequence which absence adversely affects the function of the gene. The expression also refers to the absence of the gene fragment, gene or the chromosomal fragment containing the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “another defect” refers to any genetic alteration, such as a substitution, an addition, polymorphism, insertion, inversion etc., which is associated with tumors of epithelial origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “loss of heterozygosity (LOH)” refers to the loss of a single parent's contribution to part of the cell's genome. LOH can be considered as an event to unmask a mutant allele of a gene which may play a role in suppressing tumor formation. Thus, LOH is an important marker for tumor initiation or progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “BLOH” refers to borderline LOH, meaning that one of the alleles in the tumor sample has 25%-39% signal reduction compared to its matching normal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “translocation” refers to transfer of chromosomal regions between non-homologous chromosomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “amplification” refers to gain of genetic material such as a gene fragment, a gene or the chromosomal fragment containing the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “tumor” refers to an abnormal mass of tissue due to abnormal excess of cells divisions or lack of normal cell death. Tumors may be benign or malignant, in other words not cancerous or cancerous. Tumors include such as adenomas, carcinomas or polyps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “adenoma” refers to a noncancerous tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “carcinoma” refers to a cancer of epithelial origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “epithelial” refers to the cells that line the internal and external surfaces of the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “tumors of epithelial origin” refers to tumors, which arise from epithelial cells. The tumors of epithelial origin include such as breast, colorectal, lung, urinary bladder, breast, squamous cell, basal cell, prostate, gastric, esophagus and mouth/tongue tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpithelial tumors arise from epithelium, the specified set of cells that cover organs and surfaces of the body. Epithelium can be simple, such as the one cell layer epithelium covering part of respiratory tract, mammary gland ducts and ductuli or intestine, or can be stratifies, composed of several layers of cells, such as is found in the upper layer of skin or in the urinary bladder. The epithelium of the skin is keratinizing, meaning that while the basal cells of the epidermis, covering skin are round and proliferate, the uppermost cells are flattened, non-dividing and their cytoplasm is filled with keratin fibres. The urinary epithelium, on the other hand, is not keratinizing but even here, the basally located cells are round while the cells located closer to the surface are flattened and thus, this type of epithelium is called transitional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “indicating tumors of epithelial origin” refers to that the presence or high probability or possibility of epithelial tumors is shown or described or proved or evidenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “aggressive variant” refers to a cancer, which grows fast and possibly metastasizes.\n\n\n \n \nAs used herein the expressions “fragment” or “functional fragment” refer to a part of NAV3 gene, which is detectable in the methods of the invention such as LOH-analysis or FISH-methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the expression “gene product” refers to a mRNA, protein or to any product achieved directly or indirectly from the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeuron navigator 3 (NAV3 or POMFIL1) gene is a member of a recently identified human gene family, which shows homology to the unc-53, an axonguidance gene from \nCaenorhabditis elegans \n(Maes et al. Genomics 80: 21-30, 2002). It also shares homologous sequences with human RAINB1 (retinoic acid inducible in neuroblastoma cells) a mammalian homologue of unc-53 (Merrill et al. PNAS 99: 3422-3427, 2002). By structure prediction NAV3 has calponin-like domains and SH3 binding sites suggestive of a role in cell signaling (Coy J F et al. Gene 290: 73-94, 2002 and Maes et al. Genomics 80: 21-30, 2002) NAV3 consists of 39 exons and its expression, based on mRNA detection, is largely restricted to the brain tissue (Maes et al., Genomics 80: 21-30, 2002). NAV3 was shown to produce transcripts encoding proteins of different lengths and it may be subject to tissue-specific alternative splicing. NAV3 is structurally a helicase and exonuclease, resembling Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins with the role in maintaining stability of chromosomes (Coy J F et al. Gene 290: 73-94, 2002, Maes et al. Genomics 80: 21-30, 2002). Subcellularly, NAV3 has been reported to locate in nuclear pre complexes (Coy J F et al. Gene 290: 73-94, 2002) and might have a role in nuclear transport, kinetochore formation and cell cycle control (Fahrenkrog B and Aebi U, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 4: 757-66, 2003). Thus, NAV3 could be a non-classical haploinsufficient tumour suppressor (Sherr C J, Cell 116: 235-46, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, genetic abnormalities at 12q21.1-q21.31, specifically 12q21.2, were studied by LOH analysis for colorectal adenomas, carcinomas lung cancers and urinary bladder cancer. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also utilized for colon tumors, breast cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for lung cancers in order to scrutinize chromosomal position 12q21.1-q21.31, specifically 12q21.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the microsatellite markers (D12S1684, D12S326, D12S1708) as well as the SNP marker (the intragenic NAV3 rs1852464) showed LOH at 12q21.1-q21.31 in adenomas and carcinomas of colorectum. In urinary bladder cancer samples, at least borderline LOH was detected with said four markers. Microsatellite markers also showed LOH in lung cancers. Furthermore, FISH revealed loss of 12q21 in colon tumors and both loss and gain of 12q21 in breast cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. CGH revealed loss of 12q21 in one lung cancer. Thus, loss or gain of NAV3 appears as a marker of tumors originating from epithelia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, colorectal adenomas and carcinomas arising in the same patient showed NAV3 LOH suggesting that adenoma patients will develop carcinomas through NAV3 LOH. Poor differentiation was observed in an adenoma with NAV3 LOH and the size of NAV3 LOH adenomas tended to be greater than of those without LOH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have now observed, that the chromosomal abnormalities, found in epithelial tumors, in fact do occur in tumors arising in all different types of epithelium. Thus, the basaliomas (also called carcinoma basocellulare or basal cell carcinomas) are formed from the cells normally located in the most basal part of epidermis. On the other hand, the squomous cells carcinoma (also called carcinoma squamocellulare or spinocellular carcinoma), are formed from the more distally located cells and this tumor often show keratinisation, a feature characteristic for the keratinizing cells. Carcinomas of breast and colorectal carcinomas are examples of malignant tumors arising from simple epithelium, having only one layer of cells normally, but even here, the original benign epithelium contains differentiated cell types, such as exocrine cells of the mammary gland, secreting either milk or mucus, or mucus secreting Goblet cells in the gut epithelium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpithelial tumors can be benign, premalignant or overtly malignant. We did observe the chromosomal abnormality described in more detail in this application mostly in malignant tumours, carcinomas but also in some of the premalignant conditions, such as large adenomas of colon or rectum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause genetic abnormalities were associated with tumors of epithelial origin, the presence of those abnormalities indicate the initiation, progression and/or presence of tumors of epithelial origin or the development, progression and/or presence of carcinomas. Therefore, it is possible to diagnose or identify the patients who have the tumor of the epithelial origin or carcinoma by detecting the presence of said aberrations in a biological sample. It is also possible to diagnose or identify the patients whose tumors are likely to progress or develop or transform to an aggressive variant by detecting the presence of said aberrations. The biological samples from the patients or suspected patients can be screened for the presence of said genetic abnormalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the method of the present invention, the presence or absence of genetic abnormalities can be detected from a biological sample by any known detection method suitable for detecting translocations, deletions, insertions etc. Such methods are easily recognized by those skilled in the art and include fluorescence in situ hybridisations, such as multi-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisations, multi-fluor in situ-hybridisation (MFISH), spectral karyotyping (SKY), Combined binary ratio labelling (COBRA), colour changing karyotyping (CCK). In comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) the genetic changes are classified as DNA gains and losses. CGH reveals a characteristic pattern that includes aberrations at chromosomal and subchromosomal levels. The conventional G-banding techniques can also be used in cases were the coarse detection of gains, losses or translocations is regarded as sufficient. Preferable methods are those suitable for use in clinical laboratories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, which takes advantage of the identification of NAV3 gene in tumors of epithelial origin, the presence or absence of the NAV3 gene or an equivalent or a fragment thereof can be detected from a biological sample by any known detection method suitable for detecting a gene expression (or copy number), i.e. methods based on detecting the copy number of the gene (or DNA) and/or those based on detecting the gene expression products (mRNA or protein). Such methods are easily recognized by those skilled in the art and include conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-methods, RT-PCR, in situ hybridisations, such as FISH, mRNA in situ hybridisation, Northern analysis, Southern and Western analyses, immunohistochemistry, and other immunoassays, such as ELISA. Preferable methods are those suitable for use in routine clinical laboratories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, which takes advantage of the LOH analysis for detecting abnormalities of NAV3 gene, deletion, gene conversion, mitotic recombination and chromosome loss can be detected. LOH in cancers can be identified by the presence of heterozygosity at a genetic locus in germline DNA and the absence of heterozygosity at the same locus in the tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, which takes advantage of the markers suitable for detecting abnormalities of NAV3 gene, markers include any biological markers such as microsatellite markers, SNP-markers, any probes, primers or antibodies associated with NAV3 gene. Numerous methods are suitable for analysing nucleic acids for the presence of specific sequence variations such as polymorphisms, SNP's, insertions or deletions. Allelic variants can be discriminated for example by enzymatic methods, electrophoretic methods, and physical methods. These methods include for example single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis, fragment analysis, DNA sequencing, minisequencing, primer extension methods, microarrays, mass spectrometry and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). PCRs are often used in analyzing specific sequence variations or exploited in combination with aforementioned methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the method of the invention, the biological sample can be any suitable tissue sample, such as biopsy from the epithelial tissue or lymph node or a metastatic tumor lesion in any body organ or whole blood. The biological sample can be, if necessary, pretreated in a suitable manner known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn therapy, restoration of the normal function of the NAV3 gene can be used. This may be reached by enhancing the expression of functionally homologous genes, by introducing an intact NAV3 gene or by using an altered form of the NAV3 gene or antisense oligonucleotide against the NAV3 in any technique presently available for gene therapy to prevent the progression of a proliferating disease. In particular, tumor cell growth may be slowed down or even stopped by such therapy. Such techniques include the ex vivo and in situ therapy methods, the former comprising transducing or transfecting an intact or altered NAV3 gene (or its functional domains) in a recombinant or peptide form or as antisense oligonucleotides or in a vector to the patient, and the latter comprising inserting the altered gene or oligonucleotide into a carrier, which is then introduced into the patient. Depending on the disease to be treated, a transient cure or a permanent cure may be achieved. Alternatively, monoclonal or humanized antibodies or peptides binding to the NAV3 protein or to the fusion gene generated as a result of the translocation, can be used to suppress the function of the altered NAV3 protein and thus tumor cell growth may be slowed down or even stopped. Antibodies against NAV3 could also be used to carry other agents, such as cytotoxic substances, to the cancer cells over-expressing the NAV3 gene. Such agents could then be used to kill specifically the cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnderstanding the genetic aberrations or the chromosomal changes, especially those associated with the tumor initiation will contribute to early diagnosis of cancer and treatment of patients. The present invention discloses for the first time the role of NAV3 LOH in epithelial tumors. The present invention also discloses that when NAV3 LOH is observed in colorectal adenomas it is likely that such patient will develop carcinomas through NAV3 LOH as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetection of deletions or other defects of the NAV3 gene as described in the present invention, allows thus earlier identification of patients with an increased risk to develop aggressive cancer and enables efficient cancer prevention and development of novel diagnostic and follow-up of carcinomas, such as colorectal or lung cancer. Discovery of genetic abnormalities of NAV3 in epithelial tumors also opens new possibilities in the advancement of therapies thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are given for further illustration of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that, as the technology advances, the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways. The invention and its embodiments are not limited to the examples described below but may vary within the scope of the claims.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\na) NAV3 Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis Using Microsatellite Markers\n\n\n \n \n \nHistology of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples was verified by a histopathologist. Tumors, adenomas or normal areas were dissected out to get pure normal or at least 50% ratio of carcinoma or adenoma tissue for the DNA preparation according to a standard protocol. Paraffin embedded sections were cut at 10 μm thickness and DNA was purified from these following standard protocols (Isola et al. Am J Pathol 145: 1301-1308, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLOH analysis was performed for NAV3 gene. Three microsatellite markers spanning the NAV3 gene locus at 12q21.1-q21.31 and surrounding the gene from both directions (physical distances between loci in mega-bases according to http://www.ensembl.org are given in parentheses) were chosen: pter D12S1684-(0.8 Mb)-D12S326-(0.2 Mb)-NAV3-(3.8 Mb)-D12S1708 qter. The DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: \nD12S1684F\n 5′cctgcatgcctcagttatga3′, \nD12S1684R\n 5′aacaagccataccagtcagg3′, \nD12S326F\n 5′accaggctcccctaaaagtg3′, \nD12S326R\n 5′agaatgaccagacccacagg3′, \nD12S1708F\n 5′gggaacttatgtcaaggctagga3′, \nD12S1708R\n 5′gatctagtgctcaagaggttttcaa3′. PCR reactions were performed in 25-μl reaction volume containing 75-150 ng of template DNA, \nGeneAmp\n 10× PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 mM of dNTP Mix (GE Healthcare Biosciences Ab), 0.8 umol of each primer, and 1.5 U of AmpliTaq polymerase (AB). The following PCR cycles were used for amplification: 94° C. for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of 94° C. for 30 seconds denaturation, annealing temperature of 60° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 45 seconds extension. Final extension was 72° C. for 5 minutes. The forward primers were fluorescently labeled with FAM and PCR fragments were run on the ABI3730 sequencer/genotyper and results analysed using GeneMapper v3 software (Applied Biosystems).\n\n\n \nb) NAV3 Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis Using Single Nucleotide Primer Extension, SnuPE\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DNA was prepared as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA non-radioactive method was used to quantify the relative expression of the two NAV3 alleles in patients heterozygous for the coding A/G polymorphism (rs1852464) within \nexon\n 19 of the NAV3 gene. The heterozygosity for rs1852464 is up to 0.493 in the Caucasians/Europeans making it a highly useful marker. The extension reaction of SNuPE is based on the incorporation of a single ddNTP that is selected to allow differential extension of a labeled primer annealed close to the polymorphic site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMatching tumor and normal genomic DNA samples from the same individuals were first PCR amplified using \nprimers rs1852464F\n 5′ \nCCTGCTATTTTCATCTTTCAAGC\n 3′ and \nrs1852464R\n 5′\nGGCTGGGATGCTGTTTGAG\n 3′ to yield a 130 by PCR fragment containing the A/G polymorphism. PCR reactions were performed in 25-μl reaction volume containing 60-100 ng of template DNA, \nGeneAmp\n 10×PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 mM of dNTP Mix (GE Healthcare Biosciences Ab), 0.4 μM of each primer, and 1.5 U of AmpliTaq polymerase (AB). The following PCR cycles were used for amplification: 94° C. for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of 94° C. for 30 seconds denaturation, annealing temperature of 56° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 45 seconds extension. Final extension was 72° C. for 5 minutes. The PCR product was subsequently purified by Exonuclease I (10 U/μl) and SAP (Shrimp alkaline phosphatase, 2 U/μl) (ExoSAP-IT, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCR Extension was performed using a fluorescently labeled \nextension primer\n 5′ \nGATGCTGTTTGAGCGCATCATGCTGGGCCC\n 3′ and a nucleotide mix containing the stopping nucleotide ddCTP in place of the normal cytosin. PCR Extensions were performed in 20-μl reaction volume containing 2 μl of purified PCR product, Thermo Sequenase Reaction Buffer (GE Healthcare Biosciences Ab), 50 μM of each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and ddCTP (GE Healthcare Biosciences Ab), 0.2 μM of SNuPE primer, and 6.4 U of Thermo Sequenase DNA Polymerase (GE Healthcare Biosciences Ab). The following PCR cycles were used for extension reactions: 95° C. for 2 minutes, 25 cycles of 95° C. for 20 seconds denaturation, annealing temperature of 56° C. for 20 seconds, and 70° C. for 40 seconds extension. Final extension was 70° C. for 10 minutes. This yielded extension products of: 43 by and 49 by depending on whether G or A is present in the template. The products of the primer extension reaction were run on the ABI3730 sequencer/genotyper and results analysed using GeneMapper v3 software (Applied Biosystems).\n\n\n \nc) Interpretation of LOH Results\n\n\n \n \n \nA sample was scored as showing LOH, if one of the alleles in the tumor sample had 40% or more decreased signal compared to its matching normal. There is a great consensus in the literature for using this cut off level as it is specific and sensitive enough if the tumor percentages are more than 50%, which was indeed the minimum in this study. Signal reduction up to 23% was observed in normal tissues (e.g. Cleton-Jansen et al, Cancer Res 61:1171, 2001) leaving a gray zone between 25%-39% signal reduction. These were considered here as borderline LOH “BLOH” in accordance with the published literature (Cleton-Jansen et al, Cancer Res 61:1171, 2001, Vauhkonen et al. Gastric Cancer 8: 238-244, 2005 and Kim et al. Virchows Arch 443: 491-500, 2003) (\nFIGS. 1-3\n).\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\na) NAV3 LOH Analysis of Colorectal Tumor Series\n\n\n \n \n \nThree series (designated here A, B and C) were examined:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeries A: Consecutive series of 56 colorectal carcinomas and 21 adenomas (total no=77) from 59 patients. Adenomas and carcinomas arising in the same patients were available in 10 out of the 59 cases. Judged only by the instability at the three \nchromosome\n 12 microsatellite loci examined, all of the adenomas were MSS while 14 of the 56 carcinomas showed MSI at one or more marker(s) (25%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeries B: Well-characterized series of familial colorectal tumors that tested negative for mismatch repair gene germline mutations. This consisted of 18 MSS carcinomas, 1 MSI carcinoma and 4 MSS adenomas (total number=23 tumors). This series has previously been characterized for the common molecular changes in colorectal carcinogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeries C: Well-characterized series of MSI-colorectal cancers arising in HNPCC families with proven MMR gene germline mutations (total number=24 tumors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorresponding normal samples were mostly from normal mucosae blocks or, when these were not available, from other normal body tissues available from the patients (eg. lymph nodes, appendix or blood).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicrosatellite instability, MSI, refers to genome-wide length variation of microsatellites, which are short tandem nucleotide tracts within the DNA, as a result of a failure in DNA mismatch repair, whereas microsatellite stable, MSS, refers to constant length of microsatellites, in other words lack of length variation of microsatellites caused by a failure in DNA mismatch repair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe LOH analysis was performed as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results obtained from all series examined are summarized in Table 1. Table 2 gives the results for each marker tested separately. Of special note that, using the intragenic NAV3 SNP rs1852464 as a strictly specific marker for LOH at \nNAV3 exon\n 19, the available data so far shows a frequency of 7/20 (35%) for NAV3 loss at this site in MSS tumors. These 7 tumors included 6 already implicated by the microsatellite markers while in only one case BLOH was seen at the rs1852464 SNP but not at the flanking microsatellite loci. Out of the 31 tumors that showed LOH/BLOH by microsatellite markers in series A, 23 were non informative or are still pending, leaving 8 cases for comparison with SNuPE. Of these 8 cases, 6 showed concordant NAV3 loss at the SNP rs1852464.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAV3 LOH and BLOH results in different series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMSS carcinoma\n\n\nMSI carcinoma\n\n\nMSS adenoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries A (n = 77)*\n\n\n22/42 (52%)\n\n\n 1/8 (13%)*\n\n\n 8/21 (38%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries B (n = 23)\n\n\n12/18 (67%)\n\n\n0/1 (0%)\n\n\n 3/4 (75%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries C (n = 24)\n\n\n \n\n\n5/24 (21%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n34/60 (57%)\n\n\n6/33 (18%)\n\n\n11/25 (44%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The MSI carcinoma in Series A consisted of 14 cancer of which 6 were non informative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAV3 LOH and BLOH results for each marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSnuPE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD12S1684\n\n\nD12S326\n\n\nD12S1708\n\n\n@rs1852464\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-MSS\n\n\n14/37\n\n\n13/33\n\n\n 7/29\n\n\n 9/23*\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-MSI\n\n\n0/3\n\n\n0/2\n\n\n1/4\n\n\n 0/7*\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-MSS\n\n\n 4/21\n\n\n 6/19\n\n\n 3/16\n\n\n 0/8*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadenoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-MSS\n\n\n 6/13\n\n\n 6/12\n\n\n 2/10\n\n\n4/8\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-MSI\n\n\n0/1\n\n\n0/1\n\n\n0/1\n\n\n1/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-MSS\n\n\n1/4\n\n\n1/2\n\n\n1/3\n\n\n0/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadenoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-MSI\n\n\n3/5\n\n\n0/6\n\n\n 2/11\n\n\n 0/15\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll MSS\n\n\n20/50 (40%)\n\n\n19/45 (42%)\n\n\n9/39 (23%)\n\n\n13/31 (42%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll MSI\n\n\n 3/9 (33%)\n\n\n 0/9 (0%)\n\n\n3/16 (19%)\n\n\n1/23 (4%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll MSS\n\n\n 5/25 (20%)\n\n\n 7/21 (33%)\n\n\n4/19 (21%)\n\n\n 0/9 (0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadenoma\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal all\n\n\n28/84 (33%)\n\n\n26/75 (35%)\n\n\n16/74 (22%) \n\n\n14/63 (22%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntumors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*NOTE: As usual LOH frequencies were calculated for informative cases only. SNuPE test was uninformative due to constitutional homozygosity in 9 carcinomas (8 MSS, 1 MSI) and in all 6 adenomas that showed LOH by \nchromosome\n 12 micro-satellites examined. This chance occurrence of homozygosity at the rs1852464 will make it risky to compare the available data by microsatellites versus SNuPE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2b) LOH Analysis of Colorectal Adenomas and Carcinomas Arising in the Same Patient\n\n\n \n \n \nAdenomas and carcinomas arising in the same patients were available in 10 out of the 59 cases in series A.

Out of five adenomas with LOH, the mean diameter was more than 9 mm and thus, close to the critical level of 1 cm, while in the other five cases without LOH, the mean diameter was less than 6 mm (Table 4). Furthermore, in the adenomas with LOH, one out of five showed poor differentiation while the differentiation degree in the LOH negative cases was always high.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOH analysis with markers D12S1684, D12S326 and D12S1708\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof ten cases with tubular adenomas of colon and rectum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDifferen-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase\n\n\nD12S1684\n\n\nD12S326\n\n\nD12S1708\n\n\ntiation*\n\n\nSize**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nComplete \nLOH\n \n \nLOH\n\n\nLOH\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nNo\n\n\n \nBLOH\n \n \nNo\n \n \n\n\n2\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNo\n\n\n \nBLOH\n \n \nNo\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n \nBLOH\n \n \nNo\n\n\nNo\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNo\n\n\n \nLOH\n \n \nNo\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n1\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nNo\n\n\n \nHomozygous\n \n \nHomozygous\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n1\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n1\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferentiation was graded from 1 (highly differentiated) to 3 (poor differentiation).

All tissue samples had been processed by routine formalin fixation and embedded in paraffin.\n\n\n \n \nPreparation of Nuclei from Paraffin Embedded Tissue\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50 μm sections were cut from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. After deparaffinization each section was digested with protease XXIV (Sigma) at +37° C. for 30 minutes. After enzymatic digestion, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 minutes and diluted in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.07 M NaCl, pH 7.2. Nuclear suspension was pipetted on objective slides and dried over night at room temperature. The slides were fixed with 0.01% paraformaldehyde for 4 minutes at room temperature, followed by dehydration with graded ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%). Slides were stored at −70° C.\n\n\n \n \nLabeling of Probes with Fluorescein-12-dUTP and with Alexa-594-5-dUTP\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones specific to NAV3 DNA (RP11-494K17, RP11-36P3 and RP11-136F16; Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, Ala., USA) were labeled with Alexa-594-5-dUTP (Invitrogen) and the \nchromosome\n 12 centromere probe (pA12H8) was labeled with Fluorescein-12-dUTP (Roche) using nick translation (Hyytinen E et al., Cytometry, 16: 93-99, 1994). For each labeling reaction 1-2 μg DNA was used in total reaction volume of 50 μl. 4 μl of each labeled BAC and centromere probes were mixed together with human COT1 DNA (Invitrogen) and precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. Precipitated probe mix was diluted into hybridization buffer (15% w/v dextran sulphate, 70% formamide in SSC, pH 7.0) and denatured at +76° C. for 10 minutes.\n\n\n \n \nFISH With Nuclei Extracted from Paraffin Embedded Tissue\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSlides were pretreated with 1 M sodium thiocyanate at +80° C. for 5 minutes and washed with 2×SSC three times for 5 minutes. After washing slides were treated with 50% glycerol, 0.1×SSC at +90° C. for 6 minutes, with 2×SSC for 3 minutes and with distilled water three times for 2 minutes. Slides were denatured in 70% formamide, 2×SSC at +87° C. for 7 minutes. After denaturation the slides were dehydrated with graded ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%) and digested enzymatically with proteinase K (Sigma; 8 μg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n) at +37° C. for 7 minutes. After digestion slides were dehydrated and 10 μl of denatured probe mix was pipetted on slides. Hybridisation was carried out overnight at +37° C. Slides were washed three times with 1.5 M Urea, 0.1×SSC at +45° C. for 10 minutes, once with 0.1×SSC for 10 minutes and 4×SSC for 5 minutes, followed by three washes with PN buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1% NP-40). Finally, slides were rinsed with distilled water, air dried and mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector).\n\n\n \nAnalysis and Results\n\n\n \n \n \nSlides were analysed using \nOlympus BX\n 50, Tokyo, Japan, equipped with filter set 8300 and tripleband exciter 83103× (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, Vt., USA) and a cooled CCD camera (Sensi Cam, PCO, Computer Optics, Kelheim, Germany) combined to a computer (Dell GX280, Limerick, Ireland) with software Image pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md., USA). Fifty cells were analysed from each case and the cells were grouped as normal if having two labels for \nchromosome\n 12 centromere and two for the NAV3. Polyploid cells had three or more centromere labels. NAV3 deletion was defined when the number of centromere labels was higher than the number of NAV3 labels. A few cells had one centromere and one NAV3 label; this was taken as a technical artifact. The results (Table 5) show clearly that the samples from the colon carcinomas have a high frequency of polyploidy and that these cells often show deletion of one or more of the NAV3 alleles.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of normal cells, polyploidy cells and cells with NAV3 deletion in samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom colorectal carsinoma patients and from inflammatory skin lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of\n\n\nnormal\n\n\nall polyploid\n\n\ncen > nav\n\n\n1 cen 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\ncells counted\n\n\n2/2 cells, *\n\n\ncells (>2 cen), **\n\n\ncells, ***\n\n\nnav, ****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C1,\n\n\n50\n\n\n28\n\n\n14\n\n\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C2,\n\n\n50\n\n\n31\n\n\n6\n\n\n11\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C3,\n\n\n50\n\n\n29\n\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C4,\n\n\n50\n\n\n27\n\n\n17\n\n\n9\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C5,\n\n\n50\n\n\n22\n\n\n15\n\n\n20\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C6,\n\n\n50\n\n\n19\n\n\n18\n\n\n7\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C7,\n\n\n50\n\n\n31\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C8,\n\n\n50\n\n\n21\n\n\n21\n\n\n11\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C9,\n\n\n50\n\n\n16\n\n\n30\n\n\n10\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C10,\n\n\n50\n\n\n18\n\n\n16\n\n\n16\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C11,\n\n\n50\n\n\n19\n\n\n18\n\n\n8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C12,\n\n\n50\n\n\n23\n\n\n18\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C13,\n\n\n50\n\n\n34\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C14,\n\n\n50\n\n\n19\n\n\n18\n\n\n8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C15,\n\n\n50\n\n\n23\n\n\n18\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C16,\n\n\n50\n\n\n24\n\n\n11\n\n\n8\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C17,\n\n\n50\n\n\n28\n\n\n12\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase C18,\n\n\n50\n\n\n24\n\n\n14\n\n\n12\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolon carsinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S1,\n\n\n50\n\n\n42\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S2,\n\n\n50\n\n\n43\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S3,\n\n\n50\n\n\n47\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S4,\n\n\n50\n\n\n42\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S5,\n\n\n50\n\n\n44\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S6,\n\n\n50\n\n\n38\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase S7,\n\n\n50\n\n\n41\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin, eczema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty cells per case were calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* = Normal number (2 and 2) of centromere and NAV3 labels per cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** = More than 2 centromere labels per cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** = Number of centromere labels more than NAV3 labels per cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**** = one centromere and one NAV3 label per cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nNAV3 LOH Analysis of Lung Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \nArchival paraffin-embedded samples of five patients with lung cancer without any evidence of other organ involvement or other concomitant cancer were examined.

Areas of malignant cells covering 200000 μm\n2 \nwere laser capture microdissected using the P.A.L.M. Laser-Microbeam system (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies). Thereafter, proteinase K digestion was performed and the DNA was amplified with SCOMP as previously described (Klein et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96: 4494-9, 1999 and Stoecklein et al., Am J Pathol 161: 43-51, 2002).

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96: 4494-9, 1999 and Stoecklein et al. Am J Pathol 161: 43-51, 2002). Briefly, microdissected and proteinase K digested DNA was digested with Mse I restriction enzyme (BioLabs) resulting in DNA fragments with an average length of 256 bp, adaptors were ligated to the 5′ overhangs, and DNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified DNA was then labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche) and similarly processed aliquots of reference DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers with biotin-dUTP (Roche). The labeled probes were hybridized on normal male metaphase slides for 2-3 nights. After posthybridization washes, metaphases were viewed under a fluorescence microscope and three-color digital images were captured using an epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan imagining 2, Carl Zeiss A G, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera using statistical limits for green to red ratios to determine DNA copy number gains and losses. Eight to twelve metaphases were included in the analysis for each case. As an internal control, normal male and female DNA were cohybridized and only differences in sex chromosomes were identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn tumor cells of one lung cancer patient, loss of 12q21 was shown by CGH (\nFIG. 4\n). Karyotype of the patient with SCLC and CTCL represent typical changes for SCLC: losses of 3p, 5q, 8p, 10q, and 13q, as well as gains of 5p, and 19q. Some other typical SCLC aberrations (17p loss, and 8q gain) are absent. Findings characteristic for CTCL include e.g. losses of 10q/10, and 13, and gains of 4q, 7, 17q/17, and 18, which all can be demonstrated in this case. Interestingly, loss of 12q21 was also evident.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nNAV3 Deletions in Urinary Bladder Cancer\n\n\nTissue Samples\n\n\n \n \n \nSamples from 16 patients diagnosed to have a transitional epithelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder were selected for the study. The samples were routinely fixed in neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin. 1-3 sections of 50 microns thickness were cut and the nuclei were isolated as described in Example 3, \npage\n 18, second paragraph.\n\n\n \nProbe Labeling\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones specific to NAV3 DNA (RP11-36P3 and RP11-136F16; Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, Ala., USA) were labeled with Alexa594-5-dUTP (Invitrogen) and the \nchromosome\n 12 centromere probe (pA12H8; American Type Cell Culture) was labeled with Alexa488-5-dUTP (Invitrogen) using nick translation (Hyytinen et al. 1994). 50-75 ng of each labeled BAC and 30 ng of centromere probe were mixed together with 1 μg of human COT1 DNA (Invitrogen) and precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. Precipitated probe mix was diluted into 10 μl of hybridization buffer (15% w/v dextran sulphate, 70% formamide in 2×SSC, pH 7.0).\n\n\n \nFluorescence In Situ Hybridisation\n\n\n \n \n \nNuclei slides were pretreated with 1 M sodium thiocyanate at +80° C. for 5 minutes and washed with 2×SSC three times for 5 minutes at room temperature. After washing, slides were treated with 50% glycerol, 0.1×SSC at +90° C. for 6 minutes, with 2×SSC for 3 minutes and with distilled water three times for 2 minutes. Slides were digested enzymatically with proteinase K (Sigma; 8 μg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n) at +37° C. for 8 minutes. After dehydration and air drying probe mix was pipetted on slides and slides were denatured for 6 min at +85° C. on a hot plate. Hybridisation was carried out for 48 hr at +37° C. Slides were washed three times with 1.5 M Urea, 0.1×SSC at +47° C. for 10 minutes, once with 0.1×SSC for 10 minutes at +47° C., followed by three washes with PBS, 0.1% NP-40 at room temperature. Finally, slides were rinsed with distilled water, air dried and mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium with 4′,6-diamino-2 phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Vector).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFISH results were evaluated using Olympus BX51 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective and a triple bandpass filter for simultaneous detection of Alexa488, Alexa594 and DAPI (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, Vt., USA). 200 nuclei were analysed from each case and the nuclei were grouped as normal if having two labels for \nchromosome\n 12 centromere and two for the NAV3. Polyploid nuclei had three or more centromere labels. NAV3 deletion was defined when the number of centromere labels was higher than the number of NAV3 labels and NAV3 amplification was defined when the number of NAV3 labels was higher than centromere labels. The analyses were done blinded to the diagnosis or sample identity by two independent analysers.\n\n\n \nNAV3 LOH Analysis Using Microsatellite Markers\n\n\n \n \n \nFor LOH assay (loss of heterozygocity), DNA coming both from normal tissue of the patient as well as from the tumor samples was extracted from the 10 μm thick paraffin embedded sections following standard methods (Isola et al. Am J pathol 145: 1301-1308, 1994). Analysis was performed as described in Example 1a.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe results concerning the LOH (and borderline LOH; BLOH) as well as the status of NAV3 copy number in the FISH assay are shown in Table 7. 7 out of 17 urinary bladder cancer samples (40%) showed LOH/BLOH with at least one of the markers used in the study. 20 out of 64 (30%) alleles were homozygous and could not be analyzed using LOH method. In FISH analysis, 3 out of 15 samples (20%) showed NAV3 deletion. NAV3 gene duplication (amplification) was seen with 20% of samples. One of the samples had both NAV3 deletion and amplification. Two samples were not analyzed for NAV3 copy number changes due to poor quality of the sample.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAV3 LOH and FISH analysis results in urinary bladder cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSnuPE@\n\n\nNAV3 aberration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase no\n\n\nD12S1684\n\n\nD12S326\n\n\nD12S1708\n\n\nrs1852464\n\n\n(by FISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\nLOH\n\n\n \nHomozygous\n \n \nHomozygous\n\n\ndeletion\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNo\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nNo\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\n \nNo\n \n \nHomozygous\n\n\ndeletion\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\ndeletion and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \namplification\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\n \nNo\n \n \nHomozygous\n\n\namplification\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9a\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9b\n\n\nNo\n\n\nLOH\n\n\n \nNo\n \n \nNo\n\n\namplification\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 \n\n\nBLOH\n\n\nBLOH\n\n\n \nBLOH\n \n \nHomozygous\n\n\ndeletion\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 \n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 \n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 \n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 \n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\nNo\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 \n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\n \nHomozygous\n \n \nNo\n\n\nNA\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 \n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHomozygous\n\n\namplification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo of \npostive\n \n\n\n3/17, 1 non-\n\n\n6/17, 4 non-\n\n\n1/17, 6 non-\n\n\n1/17, 9 non-\n\n\n7/15, 2 samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfindings\n\n\ninformative\n\n\ninformative\n\n\ninformative\n\n\ninformative\n\n\nnot analysed (NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nNAV3 Deletion in Breast Cancer\n\n\nTissue Samples\n\n\n \n \n \nWe studied the occurrence of NAV3 deletions in breast cancer by selecting sentinel lymph nodes from four patients operated upon for breast cancer as a study material.

More specifically, the invention provides methods of mapping and screening for anti-cancer agents using Pharmacophore models.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nWith the recent advances in targeted therapeutics and the progress in new approaches in target identification, novel anticancer agents with new mechanisms of action are under intensive investigation. Quinoxalinehydrazines represent a novel class of compounds with excellent potency in a panel of cancer cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreviously, we discovered a salicylhydrazide (SC) class of compounds with remarkable potency against several human cancer cell lines. SC141, a prototype of a series of quinoxalinhydrazides, showed in vivo efficacy in mice xenograft models of human breast cancer. We also reported structure-activity relationship studies by preparing a series of compounds using a one-step coupling of 7-fluoro-4-chloropyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines with pyrazin-2-carbohydrazide.\n1 \nThe newly synthesized compounds were tested against four cancer cell lines using MTT and colony formation assays. The substitution at the 2-carbohydrazide moiety had a dramatic effect on the activity of the drugs. A representative compound, SC161, showed higher activity than other analogues.\n1 \nWe therefore explored SC161 as a lead molecule to design novel anticancer agents with greater potency and better pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, we presented a 10 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of SC161 followed by a seven feature pharmacophore model development according to the most probable conformation to capture the high probabilistic feature orientation. Its application to database mining successfully identified several potent agents, and some of the compounds showed comparable activity profiles with SC161.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacophore concept has been widely accepted as an efficient tool for use in combination with other technologies in drug design and optimization. \n2-6 \nPharmacophore is defined as a three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of chemical features (functional groups), which is responsible for the compound to be active against an enzyme or receptor. A pharmacophore derived on the basis of a bonafide lead compound can be used as a search query to retrieve compounds with diverse structural scaffolds from a database of compounds.\n7 \nIn general, pharmacophore models can be generated either using a set of known inhibitors of an enzyme or the active site of the enzyme. Analogue-based pharmacophore models are generated by utilizing a set of known inhibitors. The use of pharmacophore models as search queries are expected to retrieve novel compounds that contain desired pharmacophoric features with diverse structural and chemical features. These compounds are then expected to bind the drug target in a similar manner as the model compounds and to exert a similar biological response. This provides an extensive chemical space for lead identification and optimization. Structure-based pharmacophore models are generated based on key chemical features in the active site of an enzyme. The use of models as search queries is expected to retrieve compounds containing complementary pharmacophoric features and shape. When the structural information of the receptor is unknown, the analogue-based approach is effective to define a pharmacophore model. A receptor-based approach requires detailed and accurate information on the key features of the enzyme active site that are involved in drug binding.\n7 \nBoth pharmacophore model approaches have been successfully applied to identify novel inhibitors specific to certain drug targets. \n8-10 \n \n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention relates to compounds or compositions comprising anticancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a compound of the invention may be of Formula 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative compounds exemplified by Formula 1 are in Table 1 and the anticancer activities are given in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR1 represents a variety of substitutions including but are not limited to hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, alkoxy, carboxyl, nitro, cyano, amino, amido, sulfonyl or any other organic functional group containing any number of carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR2 represents an aliphatic or aromatic group including alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl.

Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, sterile water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the compounds in the required amounts in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the compounds into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the compounds can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration by inhalation, the compositions are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compositions are prepared with carriers that will protect the compounds against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. “Dosage unit form,” as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic or effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration to form packaged products. Other active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above-mentioned and other features of this invention and the manner of obtaining and using them will become more apparent, and will be best understood, by reference to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The drawings depict only typical embodiments of the invention and do not therefore limit its scope.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n.

The model development was based on dynamic behavior recorded form the same 10-ns MD simulations recently employed. Subsequently, the top-ten ranking pharmacophore models were applied to screen a subset of our small molecule database. Finally, we selected structurally diverse and novel compounds which were frequently retrieved by multiple-queries and tested them against a panel of cancer cell lines to validate their cytotoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular dynamics (MD) MD studies of SC161 were carried out by GROMACS', a widely used software to simulate various biomolecular systems in aqueous or lipid bilayer environment.\n15-19 \nThe partial charges of SC161 with polar hydrogens were obtained by ab initio calculation using the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method in Gaussian program, at the High Performance Computer Center, University of Southern California. The basis set, the set of one-electron wave functions used to build molecular orbital wave functions, was set to STO-3G with spin multiplicity of 2. The topology file of SC161 consistent with GROMACS force field was generated by the PRODRG server, and was modified with the partial atomic charges by using the values calculated from the above ab initio procedure. Next, SC161 was centered in a box of 414 flexible SPC, or Simple Point Charge water molecules with a size of 2.82×2.49×1.86 nm\n3\n. GROMACS force field was used to describe bonding and nonbonding interactions. The whole system was gradually equilibrated for 50 ps at 50K, 100K, 150K, 200K, 250K, and 300K. Finally, the production phase was simulated for 10 ns at 300K in a canonical ensemble (NVT, the number of particles N, the volume V and the temperature T were set to constant values). The chemical bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were fixed using SHAKE algorithm.\n7 \nA 2 fs time-step was used and both the energy and trajectory output were collected at 2 ps interval. Van der Waats interactions and short-range electrostatic interactions were truncated at 10.0 with the particle mesh Ewald method\n21 \nsetting used for long-range electrostatic interactions. Trajectory analysis including cluster analysis was carried out using the VEGA software package \n22, 23 \nand recently reported elsewhere.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended to illustrate, but not to limit, the scope of the invention. While such examples are typical of those that might be used, other procedures known to those skilled in the art may alternatively be utilized. Indeed, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily envision and produce further embodiments, based on the teachings herein, without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmacophore model development and database search. The Pharmacophore models were built on the selected snapshots of SC161 conformation, which were taken from the MD trajectory. Initially, Catalyst software (Accelrys, Inc.) package was used to import the SC161 conformation and map the functional features (H-bond donor, H-bond acceptor, hydrophobic feature, or aromatic ring) onto the frame. To develop the feature model, geometrical constraints were assigned to each feature. For example, coordinate and size of the feature, centered at the mapped atom or motif was assigned a radius of 1.3 Å for H-bond donor to avoid feature overlapping and 1.6 Å, for the rest of the features as default. Finally, all the selected features were merged into one pharmacophore model. The generated model was used as an independent search query to screen a subset of our 5,000,000 small-molecule databases. On the basis of intuitive structural classification, we selected compounds representing the diverse chemical and structural space for their cytotoxic properties. In this study, we focused on two classes of compounds representing oxadiazolopyrazines and quinolins.\n\n\n \nCytotoxicity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCell culture. Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-435 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va.). The HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53−/− cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Md.). The human ovarian carcinoma cell line (HEY) which is naturally resistant to cisplatin, was kindly provided by Dr. Louis Dubeau, University of Southern California (USC) Norris Cancer Center, and NIH3T3 normal mouse fibroblast cells were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Press from USC. HEY and NIH3T3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI, HCT 116 cells in McCoy1s5A media and MDA-MB 435 in DMEM. Media were purchased from (Mediatech, Virginia) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini-Bioproducts, Woodland, Calif.), 2 mM L-glutamine and 5% Penicillin/streptomycin from Bio whittaker were purchased from VWR. Cells were incubated at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n. To remove the adherent cells from the flask for passaging and counting, cells were washed with PBS without calcium or magnesium, incubated with a small volume of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for 5-10 min, and washed with culture medium and centrifuged. All experiments were performed using cells at exponential growth stage. Cells were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination using a PCR-based assay (Stratagene, Tex., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrugs. Stock solutions (10 mM) of all compounds were prepared in DMSO and stored at −20° C. Further dilutions were made fresh in PBS or cell-culture media right before cell treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytotoxicity assays. Cytotoxicity was assessed by a 3-(4,s-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described.\n24 \nBriefly, cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were subsequently treated with continuous exposure to the corresponding drug for 72 h. A MTT solution (at a final concentration of 0.5 mglml) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37° C. After removal of the medium, DMSO was added and the absorbance was read at 570 nm. All assays were done in triplicate. The IC\n50 \nwas then determined for each drug from a plot of log (drug concentration) versus percentage of cells killed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColony formation assay. Colony formation assays were also performed to confirm the activity of these compounds as described.\n1,25 \nBriefly, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 500 cells/well and allowed to attach. The next day, serial dilutions of the corresponding compounds were added and allowed to incubate for 24 h. After exposure, cells were washed in PBS and cultured in drug-free media until colonies were formed (8-10 days). Cells were subsequently washed, fixed with a 1% glutaraldehyde solution for 30 min, and stained with a solution of crystal violet (2%) for 30 min. After staining, cells were thoroughly washed with water. Colonies were imaged on the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and counted using the Quantity One quantitation software package (Bio-Rad). The data reported represent means of at least three independent experiments.\n\n\n \nResults and Discussions\n\n\n \n \n \nMD trajectory and cluster analysis. MD is a well-accepted molecular mechanics approach to sample the time dependent conformational change by solving Newton's equation of motion. Previously, we applied MD simulations to develop dynamic pharmacophore models bearing features complementary to HIV-1 integrase. The models were used as searching queries to screen small molecule databases and identified novel integrase inhibitor. \n8, 26, 27 \nIn this study, we collected data from SC161 simulation in its explicit water environment at the canonical ensemble. Energy profile over all the 10 ns showed that the whole system had an average potential energy of −16576.1 KJ/Mol with <0.59% fluctuation, and an average kinetic energy of 3189 KJ/Mol with <2.0% fluctuation. Therefore, the total energy of the whole equilibrated system was −13386 KJMol with 0.57% fluctuation, indicating the system was in its well established stable state. The average simulation temperature was at 300 K with fluctuation less than 6 K.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefined variables for measuring the conformational change. To monitor the conformational changes, six parameters were initially defined to analyze the dynamic behavior of SC161. As shown in \nFIG. 1\n, two variables, d\n1\n and d\n2\n were defined to sample the distance fluctuation between atom pairs N24 to 018, and 018 to N13, respectively. In addition, three flexible torsional angles were monitored during the simulations. Those were t\n1\n defined by atoms N13-C14-N15-N16 t,\n2\n defined by C14-N15-N16-\nCla7n d t\n \n \n \n3\n defined by atoms N16-C17-C19-C20. Last, a planar angle was defined describing the orientation between the planes set by the two aromatic fragments of SC161. Plane I (P\n1\n hereafter) was defined by three atoms, C19, N21, and N24 of pyrazine motif, and plane II (P\n2\n hereafter) was defined by N5, N13, and C14 of quinoxalin scaffold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorrelations among defined variables. Apparently, the conformational behavior was strictly dependent on the three flexible dihedral angles, which could consistently be monitored by the above defined planar angle and the two distances d\n1\n and d\n2\n. \nFIG. 2\n describes the dynamic behavior of SC161 by means of the time-dependence of the defined variables. The snapshots were recorded at intervals of 2 ps, and the total of 5001 frames representing the 10-ns simulation studies. Among the three torsional angles (\nFIG. 2\n \na\n), t\n1\n is highly populated at a value close to 0° or 360° which represents the same orientation of the molecule, while t\n2\n stabilizes at its average of 180.0° with very small fluctuation. This indicates that the two torsion angles, t\n1\n and t\n2\n are rather stable, and that no major conformational change occurred to the quinoxalinhydrazine motif of SC161 which is consistently depicted by the d\n2\n index averaged at 4.8 Å±0.1 Å (\nFIG. 2\n \nb\n). This observation indicates that the conformational change is independent of t\n1\n, t\n2\n and d\n2\n, which are therefore not considered for further conformational analysis. However, torsion angle, t\n3\n, apparently samples a higher angle space than t\n1\n and t\n2\n and its value covers an entire range of 0°-360°. This consequently leads to the wide range fluctuation of both planar angle value ranging from 0°-180°, and d\n1\n value ranging from 2.7 A (cis position) to 3.8 Å (trans position) around its average of 3.5 Å. Therefore, the hydrazine motif actively flips at different angles leading to the various conformational clusters of SC161.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe performed further regression analysis for better understanding the correlation of torsion angle t\n3\n, distance d\n1\n, and planar angle. \nFIG. 3\n \na \nshows a nearly symmetric profile of distance d\n1\n versus torsion angle t\n3\n with respect to the t\n3\n value of 180°, and a strong correlation between d\n1\n and t\n3\n with the correlation coefficient of 0.92 (R\n2\n=0.85). Likewise, the planar angle was selected and further correlated with the torsion angle, t\n3\n, as described by the scatter plot in \nFIG. 3\n \nb\n. This shows a strong linear correlation between the two variables as aligned well by the linear equation functions (symmetric with respect to the t\n3\n value of 180) and with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 (R\n2\n=0.895, 0.897, respectively). The regression analysis therefore suggests that the conformational change of SC161 solely depends on the behavior of torsion t\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSnapshots cluster analysis. As discussed above, we clustered the conformation of SC161 simply based on the distributions of t\n3\n value, which were calculated from 5001 snapshots. \nFIG. 4\n shows the population of the twelve clusters with an incremental step of 30° in t\n3\n value. Due to the overlap between the conformations at t\n3\n values of 0° and 360°, the first cluster (cluster A) contained the frames with t\n3\n ranging from 0-15° and 345°-360°. Subsequently, cluster B was formed by frames with t\n3\n values of 15-45°, C with t\n3\n values of 45-75° and so on till the twelfth cluster L formed at last. The population of cluster frames shows a Gaussian distribution (\nFIG. 4\n) with the peak value of 1961 snapshots reached in the middle cluster (G) of t\n3\n range between 180°±15°.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacophore development, database screenings and cytotoxicity assays. On the basis of the above cluster analysis, we focused on the conformations collected in the top-ranked cluster G to build the pharmacophore model. The average structure of the snapshots was first generated, which essentially characterized the dynamic behavior of the frames in the cluster. Then, seven features were mapped onto the average structure. They are three H-bond acceptors defined by nitrogens of pyrazine and oxygen atom of the ketone, two H-bond donors defined by the hydrazine linker, and the two hydrophobic features were defined by the three-ring fragment of SC161 (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacophore model was applied to a subset of our database containing 350,000 small molecules where each compound is represented by an ensemble of up to 250 conformations. All together, 938 compounds were mapped by the derived model. With considerations for structural diversity and calculated pharmacokinetic properties, we initially tested 20 compounds and realized that those with oxadiazolopyrazine or quinolin motif showed significant cytotoxicity. We thus extended our search to include more compounds bearing the same scaffolds. Therefore, a total of 35 novel compounds were tested for their cytotoxic properties in a panel of cancer cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 1 lists the compounds identified from this work along with their predicted physiochemical properties and model fitting values. Cytotoxicity of these compounds against a panel of cancer cell lines are summarized in Table 2. Seventeen compounds showed IC\n50 \nvalues <10 μM. Representatives of the oxadiazolopyrazine containing compounds are 15, 2, and 6 with ICSO values <3 μM in MDA-MB-435, HCT116 p53+/+, HCT116 p53−/−, and HEY cells. Quinolin analogues such as 30 and 32 were, in general, less potent than oxadiazolopyrazines. The best compound, 2, displayed IC\n50 \nvalues <2 μM in HCT116 p53+/+, HCT116 p53−/−, and HEY cells. Additionally, 2 also exhibited mild toxicity against NIH3T3 (IC\n50\n=8 μM) \nCompound\n 15 exhibited IC\n50 \nvalue of 2.8 μM and 6.1 μM against MDA-MB-435 cell and HEY cell, respectively. 19 was toxic to HCT116 p53+/+ and p53−/− cells, while not toxic to other selected cells at dose up to 10.0 μM. Cytotoxicity of 2 was further confirmed by colony formation assay. \nFIG. 6\n shows a representative result of a colony formation assay in HCT p53+/+, and HEY cells treated with 2 at various doses. At a dose of 1 μM of 2, >95% colonies were killed in HCT p53+/+ cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n shows the representative compounds, 2 and 17, mapped against the pharmacophore model derived from the structural conformations of cluster G. Because of the multiple conformations of each compound, various mapping orientations against the model were observed. In oxadiazolopyrazines, the three H-bond acceptors could favorably be mapped by the nitrogen atoms, while the N—H could map either of the H-bond donors. On the other hand, only one of the hydrophobic features could be mapped by the aromatic motif.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nPharmacophore Model Development and Database Search\n\n\n \n \n \nWe applied the “HipHop” module in the Catalyst software package (Accelrys, Inc.) to generate a “qualitative model” based on multiple snapshot inputs without taking the biological data into consideration. This model represents the essential 3D arrangement of functional groups common to the selected set of molecules. In the traditional application of the module, the multiple molecules are the exact input set, however in this work, we concentrated on single active molecules but regarded the multiple conformations of the inputs as described below. We first created ten ensembles to represent the dynamic conformations of SC161. The 1001 frames of SC161 were collected at every lops interval of the 10-ns MD study, and were represented by 10 ensembles referred to as r\n1\n, r\n2\n through r\n10\n. Each ensemble has 100 conformations or frames except rep\n1\n which has 101 frames with 0-ps as the beginning snapshot. Therefore, r\n1\n containing 101 conformations of SC161 covers the trajectory: 0 ps-1000 ps, 1-2: 1010 ps-2000 ps, r\n3\n: 2010 ps-3000 ps, r\n4\n: 3010 ps-4000 ps, and so on, through r\n10\n, which ranges from 9010 ps to 1011 s. The purpose of creating ten compounds representing the conformational diversity of SC161 is to generate a set of inputs for the common feature model development using the Catalyst software package. It is not necessary to use ten representations; we could divide the trajectory into any desired number of subsets as long as it is more than two, the minimum requirement of the common feature model approach.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, we mapped the compound with the chemical functions (H-bond donor, H-bond acceptor, hydrophobic, negative ionizable charge feature, and positive ionizable feature, etc) available from the feature dictionary in Catalyst. A total of ten top ranking hypotheses were collected and then used as 3D queries for database mining. On the basis of frequency of mapping by the various queries and the intuitive structural classification, we selected compounds representing diverse chemical and structural space for their cytotoxic properties. For this study, we initially tested 93 compounds in a panel of cancer cell lines.\n\n\n \nCytotoxicity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCell culture.

The HEY human ovarian carcinoma cell line was kind1y provided by Dr. Louis Dubeau (University of Southern California Norris Cancer Center).

Cytotoxicity was assessed by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described.\n23 \nCells were seeded in 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were subsequently treated with continuous exposure to the corresponding drug for 72 h. An MTT solution (at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37° C. After removal of the medium, DMSO was added and the absorbance was read at 570 nm. All assays were performed in triplicate. The IC\n50 \nwas determined for each drug from a plot of log (drug concentration) versus percentage of cells killed.\n\n\n \nResults and Discussions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe overall strategies for deriving the novel Pharmacophore Model on the basis of SC161 and applying the pharmacophore models in retrieving novel compounds is summarized in \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacophore development. The molecule SC161 is represented by a set of ten representative ensembles coving the entire trajectory of the 1001 frames taken from the 10 ns MD simulation. The top ten ranking common feature pharmacophore models, labeled as M1-M10 (\nFIG. 9\n) were generated on the basis of various conformational behaviors represented by the ten input ensembles. Each of the models has five features as listed in \nFIG. 9\n, which show the most favorable mapping of SC161 against each of the ten models. The features derived in the models are an H-bond acceptor, a hydrophobic feature or a positive ionizable feature. Table 3 summarizes the feature mapping of the exported hypotheses. According to the ranking score, these ten models have very close scores values. Each of the ten input ensembles could map all five-feature in the model as indicated by the value of “1” in the table about “direct hit mask”, while the last part of “Partial Hit Mask” with value of “0” indicates that none of the molecules mapped all but one feature in the model. These hit masks provide a brief way together with the score as well to compare the common feature hypothesis. In Table 3, the pharmacophore models M1-M8 have similar types of features, i.e. two hydrophobic, one positive ionizable and two H-bond acceptor features. Models M9 and M10, however, have no positive ionizable features, but instead bear three H-bond acceptor features. The positive ionizable feature defined by Catalyst not only contains a single positively charged center, but it also includes those having the potential to be positively charged, such as primary, secondary or tertiary amide, amidine, and amidine with substituted hydrogen atom. In comparison with our recently published seven-feature model, which was derived from the single frame of the most probable conformation calculated from the same trajectory; four of the features from both models are conserved. These are the two H-bond acceptors mapped by the ketone oxygen or either nitrogen of the pyrazine, and the two hydrophobic features mapped by the pyrrolo-quinoxaline motif. Superimposition of the original seven-feature model and MI (the top-ranked model as a representative of the common feature models from this work), is shown in \nFIG. 10\n \nc \nwhile \nFIGS. 10\n \na \nand \n10\n \nb \ndescribe the individual mapping respectively. The two H-bond donors mapped by the hydrazine in the seven-feature model were not defined in this work. However, the positive ionizable feature was derived (M1-M8) based on the amidine scaffold of SC161, while an extra H-bond acceptor was defined by the quinoxaline nitrogen in M9 and M10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 lists the cluster analysis of the ten models by hierarchical average linkage method available in Catalyst. If only two clusters formed, models M1-M8 are in the same cluster, while M9 and M10 are in the other cluster. Apparently, in most situations, the two models M9 and M10 are always clustered in the same group. Not surprisingly, in all circumstances, M1 and M2 are always in the same cluster because of the identical feature locations mapped against the same conformation of SC161; however, the orientation defined by both the small sphere and the big sphere pair of one H-bond acceptor mapped by a ketone motif is slightly different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDatabase screen and cytotoxicity assay. In total, 93 compounds were selected from the database mapping against the pharmacophore models. Three compounds, SMD6, SMD18 and SMD58, displayed potency showing an IC\n50\n<10 μM in SKBR-3, HCT116 p53+/+, and HEY cell lines. SMD58 was the most potent with an IC\n50\n<3.5 μM in five cancer cell lines. We then carried out structure activity relationship (SAR) studies to test various analogues of SMD6, SMD18 and SMD58. The structures of these compounds, and their tested cytotoxic data are listed in Table 5-7. In addition, some inactive compounds are provided in the supporting information. Eleven substituents of SMD6 bearing N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)-acetamidin were tested. Three of these SMD6 analogues showed cytotoxicity at doses <10 uM. SMD6-4 and SMD6-8 had compatible toxicity profiles with an IC\n50\n<3.0 uM in certain cancer cell lines. Furthermore, 16 additional SMD18 substituents were tested by MTT assay. Interestingly, only SMD18-7 and SMD18-14 showed slightly more potency than their parent SMD8, exhibiting activity at doses <10 uM Finally, we tested 27 additional compounds bearing the core of SMD58 (Table 6), and 16 of them showed potency against various cancer cell lines. Both SMD58 and SMD58-1 had an IC\n50\n<1 uM in p53 +/+ cell line indicating much more potency than SC161.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNone of the ten models could map all three active compounds; however, SMD6 could be mapped by 4 models, M3, M7, M8, and M10. SMD18 could fit all ten models, while SMD58 could fit models M1-M8. The possible model mapping of the three potent compounds against certain pharmacophore model is depicted in \nFIG. 11\n.\n\n\n \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nOur 10 ns MD studies illustrate the dynamic behavior of SC161 and its preference for a planar conformation. As summarized in \nFIG. 8\n, the pharmacophore model using a unique approach derived from the ions-MD trajectory, was successfully applied to identify novel cytotoxic compounds. This method comprehensively takes into account all possible conformations of the small molecule. In this study, we show that conformational sampling of a single lead molecule is an efficient approach to build pharmacophore hypotheses and identify compounds with different physicochemical and drug like properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany modifications and variation of the invention as hereinbefore set forth can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof and therefore only such limitations should be imposed as are indicated by the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patent and literature references cited in the present specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n1.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCELL-PENETRATING, SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC AND NUCLEIC ACID-HYDROLYZING ANTIBODY, METHOD FOR PREPARING THE SAME AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody with cell-penetrating ability and base sequence specificity, as the next-generation gene silencing technique overcoming the problems that conventional siRNA technique has. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody, prepared by modifying a particular site of a cell-penetrating, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody which lacks substrate specificity to impart sequence specificity thereto without alteration in nucleic acid-hydrolyzing ability, which when penetrating into cells by themselves or ectopically expressed within cells, can bind specifically to single-stranded/double-stranded nucleic acid targets and hydrolyze them, thus downregulating the expression of the targeted genes. Also, the present invention is concerned with a method of preparing the antibody and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three major classes of the biopolymer that play important roles in the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA, RNA and protein. The transcription of DNA into RNA needs the help of certain proteins and ribosomes. These proteins are associated with DNA at specific sites to start transcription. The resulting RNA finds its way to a ribosome where it is translated into proteins. A typical method for examining what functions the protein products do comprises the removal of the proteins from the biosystem. A difference between behaviors of a living organism with and without the protein of interest accounts for the role which it plays in the biosystem. However, it is difficult to control the expression level of a protein of interest at discretion in living organisms. Recently, various nucleic acid-based approaches to the control of protein expression which specifically recognize and hydrolyze particular regions of targeted RNA (mRNA included) have been developed, including antisense oligonucleotides, interference RNA (RNAi), ribozyme, DNAzymes, etc. (Scherer et al., Nature Biotechnology, 21:1457-1465, 2003; Tafech et al., Current Medical Chemistry, 13:863-881, 2006). Particularly, RNAi, found in 1998, is now readily available and makes the knockdown of RNA more convenient than dose the prior art (Fire A et al., Nature, 391:806-811, 1998; Scherer et al., Nature Biotechnology, 21:1457-1465, 2003). So-called siRNA (small interfering RNAs), double-stranded (ds) RNAs 21~23 bp in length, is central to RNAi. These small RNAs with certain sequences, whether generated inside or transferred from the outside, can bind to and hydrolyze specific mRNAs to downregulate the expression of targeted proteins within cells (called gene knockdown). Although its principle has been established for not yet 10 years, the siRNA technique is now the most widely applied for decreasing the expression level of proteins in plant/animal cells. However, there are several problems with RNAi upon practical application. One representative example is an off-target effect which is generated when the RNA, even 21-mer in length, cannot pair with the target. Further, siRNA-induced gene knockdown is significantly decreased or is not elicited if siRNA differs from the target in even one or two base pairs. In addition, RNAi may be effective operated in a specific region of a target gene, but does not work in the other range at all in many cases. Besides, including undesired immune response, improper cellular delivery, nuclease susceptibility, etc. act as inhibitive factors in the practical application of siRNAs (Scherer LJ et al., Nat Biotechnol, 21:1457-1465, 2003; Tafech A et al., Curr Med Chem, 13:863-881, 2006).\n\n\nSince the first finding in the serum of a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 1957, nucleic acid (DNA/RNA)-binding antibodies, a kind of autoantibodies, are detected in autoimmune disease patients or mice (Robbins W et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 96(3): 575-9, 1957). Many anti-nucleic acid autoantibodies are practically found in patients with SLE or multiple sclerosis. Generally, they bind to nucleic acids with the lack of sequence specificity (Jang YJ et al., Cell.Mol.Life Sci., 60(2):309-20, 2003; Marion TN et al., Methods 11:3-11, 1997).  It is reported that sera from SLE patients and the SLE mouse model MRL\n-\n\n\n \nlpr/lpr\n \n have high titers of anti-nucleic acid antibodies and studies on autoantibodies have been conducted mainly in patients with autoimmune diseases (Dubrivskaya V et al., Biochemistry (Mosc), 68(10):1081-8, 2003).\n\n\nIn 1992, a nucleic acid-binding antibody with ability to hydrolyze nucleic acids was first found (Shuster A et al., Science, 256 (5057):665-7, 1992). Since then, biochemical studies have been focused thereon (Nevinsky G et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 269(1-2):235-49, 2002). Studies on nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies have been thus advanced in terms of biochemistry, but have remained in the initial phase in terms of the antibody engineering aspect, such as improvements in stability, affinity and specificity for various applications of antibodies (Cerutti M et al., J. Biol. Chem., 276(16): 12769-73, 2001; Kim YR et al., J. Biol. Chem., 281(22): 15287-95, 2006).\n\n\nBinding between antibodies and nucleic acids and between non-antibody proteins and nucleic acids is disclosed in several reports. First, a zinc finger, a non-antibody protein, is representative of naturally occurring DNA binding motifs, like leucine zipper and helix-turn-helix (Jamieson A et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov., 2(5):361-8, 2003). A zinc finer, a small protein domain composed of about 20~30 amino acid residues, coordinates a zinc ion (Zn\n2+\n) with a usual combination of two cysteines and two histidine residues from four different directions. Being practically responsible for DNA binding, the alpha-helix of the zinc finer is associated with the major groove of DNA while interacting with three bases. The interacting triplet of DNA differs depending on the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger. Accordingly, when modified in the alpha-helix without a conformational change, a zinc finer can recognize a new base sequence which is different from the prior one. Since 1999 in which specific fingers were successfully modified for 16 GNN triplets (Segal D et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96(6):2758-63, 1999), extensive research have been performed to establish a method for modifying substrate specificity (Caroll D et al., Nat. Protoc. 1(3):1329-41, 2006). Because they have only an ability to bind to nucleic acids, however, the modified zinc fingers require an additional modification for association with a nucleic acid-hydrolyzing enzyme (Mani M. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 334(4):1191-7, 2005).\n\n\nA second approach is an empirical method which takes advantage of the DNA-binding domain of human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 protein (E2C) in binding a target DNA (M. Laura et al., J. Bio. Chem., 276(16): 12769-73, 2001). A DNA-E2C complex is injected into a mouse to produce anti-DNA antibodies through somatic hypermutation. In this regard, the mouse should recognize the DNA as an antigen. For this, first, a DNA-protein (E2C) complex is intra-abdominally injected into a mouse to induce an immune response. When the DNA-E2C complex is repetitively injected for a certain time to amplify the immune response, antibodies with specificity for the DNA of the injected DNA-E2C complex are produced through somatic hypermutation. After the amplification, the resulting antibodies are isolated from the mouse. From among the isolates capable of specifically binding to the DNA, an antibody showing highest affinity for the DNA can be selected by reacting them with the DNA of interest.\n\n\nA rational design provides a third way to describe the binding of antibodies to nucleic acids. In this method, a β-sheet of human γ-B-crystallin is used to generate a universal binding site through randomization of solvent-exposed amino acid residues selected according to structural and sequence analyses (Hilmar E. et al., J. Mol. Biol., 372:172-85, 2007). As a general rule, an antibody is structurally divided into frameworks and flexible, sequence-variable CDRs (complementarity-determining regions). The flexibility of CDRs allows the antibody to form an induced-fit with an antigen. An alternative mechanism for high specificity and affinity is a lock and key model. In this regard, because the protein already forms a complementary structure to retain a high affinity for the substrate, it can maintain essential antibody stability and undergoes no conformational changes upon binding and thus can more strongly bind with the substrate (Jackson R. et al., Protein Sci.,8:603-13, 1999).\n\n\nRecent trends in protein engineering and library selection are therefore shifted from the CRDs to the framework. In fact, first, a functional Zn-binding site is introduced on the surface of the β-barrel of mammal serum retinol-binding protein using a rational design (Muller H. et al., Biochemistry, 33: 14126-35,1994). Next, binding activity is imparted to the β-sheet of a cellulose-binding domain derived from the CBH (cellobiohydrolase) Cel7A of Trichoderma reesei by mutation (Lehtio J. et al., Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet., 41:316-22, 2000). Another study is concerned with an ankyrin repeat protein composed of two antiparallel α-helices and one β-turn (Binz H. et al., J.Mol.Biol., 332:489-503, 2003).\n\n\nGene silencing by targeting specific genes for degradation at the mRNA level so as to downregulate the expression of the proteins encoded thereby is known to be an invaluable tool for gene function analysis as well as a powerful therapeutic strategy for human diseases, including cancer and viral infections. Conventional gene silencing techniques are, for the most part, based on the ability of nucleic acids complementary to single-stranded nucleic acids to inhibit the translation of mRNA (Scherer LJ et al., Nat Biotechnol, 21:1457-65, 2003; Tafech A et al., Curr Med Chem, 13:863-81, 2006). Of them is representative siRNA (small interfering RNA). However, siRNA suffers from the disadvantages of lacking cell-penetrating ability, being low in stability due to RNase susceptibility, being likely to acting on off-targets, and inducing immunogenicity.\n\n\nAs described above, the conventional gene silencing technique such as that using siRNA can cause a specific gene to decrease in expression level, but requires an additional modification for ability to hydrolyze nucleic acids in such a way that it is conjugated with a nuclease hydrolyzing enzyme.\n\n\nCurrently marketed drugs and drug development under current study are based on small molecules, proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Most of them are designed to bind to proteins the activity of which is in turn controlled to elicit pharmaceutical effects. Particularly, almost all monoclonal antibodies and proteins target membrane proteins or extracellular proteins. In spite of a great number of different genes associated with various diseases, drug development has been focused on protein targets so far, resulting in a very limited number of drugs. If developed, drugs which can control diseases at an RNA or DNA level, but not at a protein level, that is, which can target intracellular RNA or DNAs may cover a wider range of diseases. Further, nuclease-hydrolyzing antibodies which can penetrate into cells and recognize particular base sequences may be highly likely to be developed into next-generation gene-silencing and anti-viral agents.\n\n\nTherefore, there is a need for an antibody that can itself penetrate into cells without external protein delivery systems, and can specifically bind to and hydrolyze single-stranded/double-stranded target nucleic acids of particular sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading to the present invention, intensive and thorough research into gene silencing, conducted by the present invention, with the aim of overcoming the problems encountered in the prior art, resulted in the finding that a cell-penetrating, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody which lacks substrate specificity can be imparted with specificity for single- or double-stranded targets without alteration in nucleic acid-hydrolyzing ability by modifying a particular site thereof and that the modified antibody, when penetrating into cells by themselves or expressed within cells, can bind specifically to single- or double-stranded nucleic acid targets and hydrolyze them, thus downregulating the expression of certain genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody which can penetrate into cells, bind specifically to a single-stranded/ or double-stranded nucleic acid target of a particular base sequence, and hydrolyze it.\n\n\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide to a method of preparing the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 1 schematically shows the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention with regard to formats thereof (A) and the hydrolyzation of single- or double-stranded target nucleic acids of particular base sequences (B).\n\n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a procedure in which after being translocated into the cytoplasm by cellular penetration or cytosolically expressed by transfection, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody with sequence specificity of the present invention acts to specifically recognize and hydrolyze an exogenous target gene carried by external matter (e.g., virus) or an endogenous target mRNA, thereby inhibiting viral proliferation or protein expression.\n\n\nFIG. 3 is a view showing the tertiary structure of 3D8 VL (A) and the amino acid sequences and base sequences of the c-(residues 41-45), c'-(residues 50-54) and f-β-strands(residue 90-94) constituting the putative DNA/RNA recognition site of 3D8 VL WT, and the NNB codons used for mutation (B).\n\n\nFIG. 4 shows the construction of a library of nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody on the template of \n3D8 VL\n 4M (A), the expression of the library on yeast cell surfaces following cotransformation with a yeast display vector (pCTCON) by electroporation (B) and FACS analysis of the expression levels of the library (C).\n\n\nFIG. 5 shows the representative screening procedures for the isolation of 3D8 VL variants preferentially binding to the two ss-DNA target substrates, G\n18 \n(A) and Her2\n18\n (B), from the yeast surface-displayed 3D8 VL library.\n\n\nFIG. 6 is a view showing the amino acid sequence alignment of 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M variants selected against the target 18-bp ss-DNAs, G\n18\n (4MG1-4MG6) and Her2\n18\n (4MH1-4MH5), focusing on the 15 randomized positions on the c- (residues 41-45), c'- (residues 50-54) and f-β-strands (residues 90-94).\n\n\nFIG. 7 shows data for SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified 11 variants (A), and size-exclusion HPLC (B) and Far-UV CD (circular dichroism) spectroscopy (C) of the representative variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2), compared with 3D8 VL WT and 4M.\n\n\nFIG. 8 shows results of the agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA-hydrolyzing activity of the 11 variants (A) and for RNA-hydrolyzing activity of 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 (B).\n\n\nFIG. 9 shows plots of the enzyme kinetics of the 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) as functions of the concentrations of FRET substrates (A\n18\n, T\n18\n, C\n18\n, (G\n4\nT)\n3\nG\n3\n, Her2\n18\n, N\n18\n) from 16 nM to 2 μM.\n\n\nFIG. 10 is of schematic diagrams showing plasmids for the cytosolic expression of 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5) (A, pcDNA3.1), GFP (B, pEGFP-N1), GFP (C, pG\n18\n-EGFP in which G\n18 \nis located in the N-terminal upstream of EGFP), and EGFP (D, pHer2\n18\n-EGFP in which Her2\n18 \nis located in the N-terminal upstream of EGFP).\n\n\nFIG. 11 shows target gene silencing activity of selected 3D8 VL variants, which were ectopically co-expressed with target-sequence carrying EGFP in HeLa cells.

Her2-negative HeLa cells were untransfected or transfected with a plasmid encoding the full-length Her2 gene, and were either untreated or treated  with 3D8 VL WT and Her2\n18\n-selective 4MH2.

When it penetrates into the cytoplasm or is expressed within cells, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention can bind specifically to and hydrolyze a single- or double-stranded nucleic acid target of a particular base sequence to downregulate the expression of the particular gene.\n\n\nThe engineered, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention has amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 14 to 24 with preference for SEQ ID NOS: 16, 18 and 21. The base sequences of nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 25 to 35, with preference for SEQ ID NOS: 27, 29 and 32.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention may be in its entirety or may be a functional fragment. The antibody in its entirety may be in the form of a monomer or a multimer in which two or more entire antibodies are associated with each other and include the entire IgG. As used herein, the term \"a functional fragment\" with respect to an antibody is intended to refer to an antibody fragment having a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region which can recognize the substantially same epitope as does the entire antibody. Examples of the functional fragment of the antibody include single domain of the heavy chain variable region, single domain of the light chain variable region, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), (scFv)\n2\n, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, diabody, and disulfide-stabilized variable fragments (dsFv), but are not limited thereto, with single domain of the light chain variable region being preferred.\n\n\nWith reference to FIG. 1, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention is schematically illustrated with regard to formats thereof (A) and the hydrolyzation of single- or double-stranded target nucleic acids of particular base sequences (B). With reference to FIG. 2, a schematic illustration is given of a procedure in which after being translocated into the cytoplasm by cellular penetration or cytosolically expressed by transfection, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody with sequence specificity of the present invention acts to specifically recognize and hydrolyze an exogenous target gene carried by external matter (e.g., virus) or an endogenous target mRNA, thereby inhibiting viral proliferation or protein expression.\n\n\nNext, turning to the method of preparing the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention, its description is given in a stepwise manner as follows.\n\n\nStep 1) is to synthesize a library of genes using a cell-penetrating, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody lacking sequence specificity as a template. As the antibody which can penetrate into cells and hydrolyze nucleic acids, but lacks sequence specificity, \n3D8 VL\n 4M or its variant is preferred. A structural analysis of 3D8 VL allowed a putative nucleic acid-binding site composed of the c-, the c'- and the f-β-strand. This putative binding site is randomized with the degenerated NNB codons (N=A/T/C/G, B=C/G/T) to construct on yeast cell surfaces library with mutations at all residues.\n\n\nStep 2) is of the construction of the library on a cell surface. The amplified 3D8 VL library gene are co-transformed together with a display vector into cells by electroporation to construct library of 3D8 VL on yeast cell surfaces. Examples of the display vector useful in the present invention include phage display, bacterial display, ribosome display, RNA display and yeast cell display vectors, but are not limited thereto. In the present invention, a yeast display vector is employed for library construction. The library was expressed well on yeast cell surfaces.\n\n\nIn Step 3), the \n3D8 VL\n 4M antibody library is screened against target nucleic acid sequences to select 3D8 VL variants specifically binding thereto. In this regard, 5'-biotinylated target nucleic acids are used to analyze the antibody library for specific affinity therefor. The target nucleic acids may be endogenous or exogenous. Preferably, endogenous nucleic acids may be nucleic acids coding for proteins which are overexpressed in specific response to cancer cells. A preferred exogenous nucleic acid is a viral genomic nucleic acid or a nucleic acid coding a viral protein. In greater detail, the antibody libraries are screened against two 5'-biotinylated DNA targets (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n) during which they are analyzed for affinity for the respective targets (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n) in comparison with off-target nucleic acids using MACS and FACS. Based on the analysis, variants with strong specificity for the targets (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n) are selected. As a result, six variants, 4MG1, 4MG2, 4MG3, 4MG4, 4MG5 and 4MG6, were selected for the single-stranded DNA target (G\n18\n) while five variants 4MH1, 4MH2, 4MH3, 4MH4 and 4MH5 were observed to have strong affinity for the single-stranded DNA target (Her2\n18\n). These 11 variants in total have amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 14 to 24, respectively, with SEQ ID NOS: 16(4MG3), 18(4MG5) and 21(4MH2) being preferred. Correspondingly, the base sequences of the 11 variants are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 25 to 35, respectively. Accordingly, SEQ ID NOS: 27(4MG3), 29(4MG5) and 32(4MH2) are preferred. The selected variants are purified with greater than 90% purity and exist as soluble monomers with the secondary structures retained therein. Also, the 3D8 VL variants exhibited 10~100-fold greater K\nD\n for their respective target substrates 4MH2 for Her2\n18\n and 4MG3 and 4MG5 for G\n18 \nthan off-targets because the affinity thereof greatly increases for the target substrates, but remains unchanged for off-targets. In addition, showing higher Vmax values for substrate degradation rate compared to 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M, the variant antibodies recognize, specifically bind to and hydrolyze target nucleic acid sequences faster. Therefore, the variants according to the present invention are adapted to have sequence specificity with the retention of the ability to hydrolyze DNA and RNA.\n\n\nThe expression level of EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) without the target sequence of G\n18\n or Her2\n18 \nwas affected  neither by variants of the present invention nor by 3D8 VL wild-type. Meanwhile, cells cotransfected with vectors carrying the 3D8 VL variant of the present invention together with a vector carrying EGFP with G\n18 \nor Her2\n18 \ntarget sequence at the N-terminus expressed much lower EGFP signals than  cotransfected with the 3D8 VL wild-type. It strongly suggested that the variants expressed within the cells hydrolyzed the mRNAs carrying the target sequences such as G\n18\n-EGFP mRNA and Her2\n18\n-EGFP mRNA, thus decreased the expression level of GFP. When expressed within cells, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies which are mutated to recognize target base sequences can hydrolyze mRNA containing target base sequences and thus downregulate the expression of the protein encoded by the mRNA. The variants of the present invention are demonstrated to have sequence specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing ability when they were ectopically expressed in the cells.\n\n\nIn addition, the variants of the present invention are found to penetrate into human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) and human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR3) to an extent similar to that of the 3D8 VL wild-type. The internalization of the variants into cells proceeds to similar extents between cells pretreated with chlorpromazine for inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis and with cytochalasin D for inhibiting macropinocytosis. In contrast, the cell-penetrating ability of the variants is remarkably decreased upon the pretreatment of cells with heparin for interfering with the electrical interaction of the positively charged variants with the negatively charged cell surface proteoglycan (heparansulfate) or upon pretreatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) for inhibiting caveolae/lipid raft endocytosis, demonstrating that the variants are introduced into the cells through the caveolae/lipid raft endocytic pathway following electrical interaction with abundant proteoglycans on cell surfaces.\n\n\nFurther, the variants according to the present invention show low cytotoxicity against human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231) or human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). Particularly, the viability of Her2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 or MDA-MB-231 cells is significantly decreased by the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing 4MH2 with Her2 sequence specificity because of its strong cytotoxicity. This result is attributed to the fact that 4MH2 downregulates Her2 expression, which is coincident with the previous report that Her2-overexpressing cells decreases in viability with the decreasing of Her2 expression. At this time, the cell death was observed to show an apoptotic pattern (Annexin V positive).\n\n\nAs described above, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies in accordance with the present invention are prepared by modifying a particular site of a cell-penetrating, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody which lacks substrate specificity to impart sequence specificity thereto without alteration in nucleic acid-hydrolyzing ability. The engineered nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies, when penetrating into cells by themselves or expressed within cells, bind specifically to single-stranded/double-stranded nucleic acid targets and hydrolyze them, thus downregulating the expression of certain genes. Therefore, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies according to the present invention can be an alternative to or a substitute for conventional gene silencing techniques such as siRNA. Particularly, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies of the present invention can downregulate the expression of target proteins or the proliferation of target genomes at RNA or DNA levels, but not at protein levels, by binding specifically to and hydrolyzing RNA or DNA, so that they are useful as therapeutics for cancers and viral diseases. Accordingly, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies of the present invention may be developed into novel anticancer drugs or anti-viral drugs with the anticipation of making inroads into the market.\n\n\nIn accordance with a further aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody of the present invention alone or in combination with at least one conventional anti-cancer or anti-viral ingredient.\n\n\nFor use in practical administration, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle in addition to the active ingredient. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle include biological saline, sterile water, Ringer's solution, buffered saline, dextrose solutions, maltodextrin solution, glycerol, ethanol, etc. Optionally, other typical additives such as antioxidants, a buffer, bacteriostatic agents, etc. may be added to the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The composition may be formulated into injections such as aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, etc., pills, capsules, granules or tablets using diluents, dispersants, surfactants, binders, and/or lubricants. In addition, the composition may be formulated into suitable dosage forms according to a method well known in the art or the method disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Science (latest), Mack Publishing Company, Easton PA.\n\n\nThe composition of the present invention may be orally or non-orally (intravenously, subcutaneously, intra-abdominally, or locally) administrated. Its dose varies depending on the weight, age, gender, health condition, and diet of patient, time of administration, administration route, excretion rate, severity of diseases, etc. The nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody is administrated at a daily dose of from about 0.01 to 10 ㎎/㎏ and preferably at a daily dose of from 1 to 5 ㎎/㎏ once or in multiple doses a day.\n\n\nIn order to suppress the expression of pathogenic proteins or the proliferation of viral genes, the composition of the present invention may be used alone or in combination with surgery, hormonal therapy, chemical therapy or biological response regulators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA better understanding of the present invention may be obtained through the following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed as the limit of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n: Design of \n3D8 VL\n 4M Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Expression of \n3D8 VL\n 4M Antibody on Yeast Cell Surface\n\n\n\n\nThe first step of engineering a 3D8 VL antibody into a sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing one was to display the antibody on yeast cell surfaces. The antibody was the \n3D8 VL\n 4M which was higher in DNA/RNA hydrolyzing activity than was the wild-type (WT). \n3D8 VL\n 4M had four mutations of Q52R, Y55H, W56R, and H100A. In order to express the \n3D8 VL\n 4M antibody on yeast cell surfaces, a \n3D8 VL\n 4M gene was subcloned from the \nE. coli\n expression vector \npET23M 3D8 VL\n 4M into the yeast cell surface display vector pCTCON. For the amplification of the \n3D8 VL\n 4M gene, a pair of primers with NheI/BamHI recognition sites was designed. The exact insertion of the \n3D8 VL\n 4M gene into pCTCON was identified by base sequencing analyses, followed by the transformation of the recombinant vector into \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n EBY100. Transformed colonies were cultured at 30℃ for 20 hrs in selective SD-CAA media (20g/L glucose, 6.7g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5.4g/L Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 8.6g/L NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n·H\n2\nO, 5g/L casamino acids) with agitation. Protein expression was achieved by incubation at 30℃ for 20 hrs in SG-CAA media (20g/L galactose, 6.7g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5.4g/L Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 8.6g/L NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n·H\n2\nO, 5g/L casamino acids). The cell-surface expression of the desired protein was determined using FACS. The expression of \n3D8 VL\n 4M on yeast cell surfaces could be identified by detecting a C-terminal myc-tag. This expression was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by using an anti-myc 9E10 antibody (Sigma, USA) as a primary antibody with FITC conjugated-goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, USA) serving as a secondary antibody for recognizing the constant region of the primary antibody. In order to determine the cell-surface expression and target substrate binding levels of the 3D8 VL library, about 2x10\n6\n yeast cells were treated with biotin-labeled nucleic acids in 50 ㎕ of Tris buffer (25mM Tris, 137mM NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, 0.1% BSA) and then with an anti-myc antibody, washed with Tris buffer and labeled with an FITC conjugated-goat anti-mouse IgG. Quantitative analysis performed on BD FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, USA) showed high expression levels of \n3D8 VL\n 4M on yeast cell surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n2. Selection of Model Sequence\n\n\n\n\nA model sequence for modifying the \n3D8 VL\n 4M antibody into a variant with sequence specificity was selected. The biotinylated nucleic acid used in 1 was used as a model sequence. The corresponding sequence was Human epidermal growth factor-2 (Her2/ErbB2) which is known to be overexpressed in breast carcinoma cells and thus involved in the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. Among the entire sequence of Her2, only 18 residues, corresponding to positions 2391-2408, identified as 5'-AAT TCC AGT GGC CAT CAA-3', were used for the antibody engineering, and called Her2\n18\n. Another model sequence, called G\n18\n, identified as 5'-GGG GGG GGG GGG GGG GGG-3' was also used for model target substrates.\n\n\n3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M have amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2, respectively. Their corresponding base sequences are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 4, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n : Construction of \n3D8 VL\n 4M Antibody Library\n\n\n\n\nAfter \n3D8 VL\n 4M was observed to be expressed at a high level on yeast cell surfaces, a \n3D8 VL\n 4M library was constructed. For the generation of variants which bind specifically to and hydrolyze certain base sequences, libraries were constructed based on the template of \n3D8 VL\n 4M. First, the structure of 3D8 VL was analyzed to determine a putative nucleic acid-binding site composed of the c-, c'- and f-β-strands. It was designed to randomize targeted mutation residues at the in c- (residues 41-45), c'- (residues 50-54) and f-β-strand (residues 90-94) with degenerate NNB codons (N=A/T/C/G, B=C/G/T) to generate library on yeast cell surfaces. Because 3D8 VL was not mutated at all residues, the yeast surface-displayed gene libraries were constructed on the template of 4M using overlapping PCR mutagenesis with primers which had mutations at certain residues. The base sequences of the primers (1F, 2R, 3R, 4F, 5R, 6F, 7R) used for the library construction are given as SEQ ID NOS: 5 to 11, respectively. In the NNB codon, N stands for an equimolar nucleotide mixture of A, T, C and G (25% each), and B for an equimolar nucleotide mixture of C, G and T (33% each). The NNB codon is a combination of codons for all 20 amino acids with a stop codon rate of 2.1%.\n\n\nThe amplified library were transformed, together with a yeast surface-display vector, into yeast cells by homologous recombination. For this, the amplified gene libraries (10 ㎍/㎖) and a yeast surface-display vector (pCTCON, Colby et al., Methods enzymol, 388:248-258) (1 ㎍/㎖) were introduced into yeast cells using an electroporation technique to display the libraries on the yeast cell surface (Lee HW et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 343:896-903, 2006; Kim YS et al., Proteins: structure, function, and bioinformatics, 62:1026-1035, 2006). The library gene was prepared in a total amount of 300㎍ while the vector was used in an amount of 30㎍. \n3D8 VL\n 4M library size determined by plating serial dilutions of the transformed cell on the selective agar plates was about 2×10\n8\n.\n\n\nThe expression of the library was quantitatively analyzed using FACS. Because any problem occurred during the construction did not permit the normal expression of the library gene, FACS analysis also made it possible to examine whether the library was constructed well.\n\n\nFIG. 3 shows the tertiary structure of 3D8 VL (A) and the amino acid sequences and base sequences of the c-(residues 41-45), c'- (residues 50-54) and f-β-strand (residue 90-94) constituting the putative DNA/RNA recognition site of 3D8 VL WT, and the NNB codons used for mutation (B).\n\n\nWith reference to FIG. 4, there are schematic views showing the construction of a library of nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody on the template of \n3D8 VL\n 4M (A), the expression of the library on yeast cell surfaces following cotransformation with a yeast display vector (pCTCON) by electroporation (B) and FACS analysis of the expression levels of the library (C).\n\n\nFrequencies of mutants in the constructed libraries are given in Table 1, below.\n\n\n[Table 1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 4, the libraries constructed on the template of \n3D8 VL\n 4M were normally expressed, demonstrating that the libraries were displayed on yeast cell surface well.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n: Selection of Variants Specific for Target Sequence from Libraries of \n3D8 VL\n 4M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Screening of Libraries of \n3D8 VL\n 4M Using Competitor\n\n\n\n\nThe constructed libraries were screened against two types of 5'-biotinylated DNA using MACS and FACS. The MACS and FACS screening was performed at a high salt concentration (0.3M) to exlude non-specific binders that interacts with DNA phosphate backbone through electrostatic interactions. To ensure that selected 3D8 VL variants will bind specifically to the given target sequences, non-biotinylated off-target competitors (DNA) was added to the target substrate. N\n18 \nDNA was used as a competitor for Her2\n18\n. In order to detect the clones selectively binding to G\n18\n, three types of DNA, A\n18\n, T\n18\n and C\n18\n were used as competitors at a NaCl concentration of 0.3 M. Base sequences of the 5'-biotinylated substrates (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n) used for screening variants specific for target base sequences are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 12 and 13, respectively.\n\n\nFIG. 5 shows the representative Screening procedures for the isolation of 3D8 VL variants preferentially binding to the two ss-DNA target substrates, G\n18 \n(A) and Her2\n18\n (B), from the yeast surface-displayed 3D8 VL library.\n\n\nWith the increase in screening round, as seen in FIG. 5, the variants specifically binding to target sequences were enriched. The variants enriched an each round of the screening were found to have high affinity for target sequences, but low affinity for off-targets.\n\n\n\n\n2. Analysis of High Affinity Variants for Binding Specificity\n\n\n\n\nAfter the FACS analysis of variants for binding to targets (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n) and off-targets, 11 variants were selected against the single-stranded DNA targets (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n): 4MG1, 4MG2, 4MG3, 4MG4, 4MG5 and 4MG6 against the single-stranded DNA target G\n18\n, and 4MH1, 4MH2, 4MH3, 4MH4 and 4MH5 against the single-stranded DNA target Her2\n18\n. These 11 variants are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 14 to 24 with respect to the amino acid sequences thereof, respectively, with the base sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 25 to 35 corresponding thereto.\n\n\nThe selected 11 variants were analyzed for binding specificity for the target substrates (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n) and off-targets by FACS. Coincident with the data of the library screening, their affinity was measured to be high for their target single-stranded DNA substrates (G\n18\n, Her2\n18\n), but relatively low for off-targets.\n\n\nIn order to examine the sequences of the 11 variants, plasmids carrying the variants were subjected to base sequencing analyses following purification and amplification. Referring to FIG. 6, the 11 variants are shown for their amino acid sequences of the c- (residues 41-45), c'- (residues 50-54) and f-β-strand (residues 90-94).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n : Expression, Purification, and HLPC and CD Analysis of Selected Variants\n\n\n\n\nIn order to purify the selected variants of Example 3 in soluble forms, an examination was first made of the expression of them with yeast and E. coli expression vectors. Because of high expression levels of the variants on yeast cell surfaces, they were first subcloned in-frame into yeast expression vectors which were in turn transformed into a \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n 2805 strain. In contrast to the surface expression, they were not expressed solubly well in the yeast strain. Thus, an \nE.coli \nBL21(DE3) strain was employed as an expression system. Although expressed at a high level in E. coli, the selected variants were not purified in a soluble fraction. Almost all of the variants were expressed dominantly in an insoluble form of inclusion body. Thus, the proteins in the form of inclusion body were purified and refolded (Lee SH et al., Protein Science, 15:304-313, 2006).\n\n\nThe purity of the purified 11 variants was determined by SDS-PAGE while HPLC was performed to examine whether the variants, after purification from the inclusion body, existed solubly as monomers. In addition, the antibody libraries according to the present invention were designed to have mutations in the framework, but not in the CDR, unlike typical antibody libraries. Thus, the selected variants were examined for secondary structure using Far-UV CD (circular dichroism) spectroscopy.\n\n\nWith reference to FIG. 7, data for the purified 11 variants are given of SDS-PAGE (A), HPLC (B) and Far-UV CD spectroscopy (C).\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 7, all of the 11 variants were found to be greater than 90% in purity as measured by SDS-PAGE (A). Main HPLC peaks of the variants (4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2) were read at the same positions as in 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M, demonstrating that most of the purified proteins existed in a soluble form of monomers (B). As for the secondary structure, the variants 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 exhibited Far-UV CD spectra very similar to those of 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\n : Affinity for Nucleic Acid and Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Activity of Selected Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Affinity of Variants for Nucleic Acid\n\n\n\n\nThe selected variants were subjected to SPR analysis using Biacore2000.  The specificity and affinity of the selected variants and 3D8 VL WT for the target (G\n18\n) and off-targets were evaluated.\n\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 2, below.\n\n\n[TABLE 2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Table 2, the variants show a great difference in affinity between the targets and the off-targets whereas WT and 4M do not significantly differ in affinity from one sequence to another sequence. The variants selected from the libraries constructed on the template of \n3D8 VL\n 4M were greatly improved in affinity for the targets Her2\n18\n and G\n18\n, but remained unchanged in affinity for off-targets, with about 10~100-fold difference in affinity between them, which demonstrated that the variants of the present invention was modified to bind specifically to the targets.\n\n\n\n\n2. Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Activity of Variants\n\n\n\n\nThe nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of the purified variants was assayed with agarose gel electrophoresis. A pUC19 plasmid was used as a substrate. It was purified with the aid of a miniprep kit (Intron Inc., Korea). Greater than 95% of the purified pUC19 plasmid was in the form of supercoiled plasmid as patterned on 0.7% agarose gel. A hydrolytic reaction between the plasmid substrate and the variants was conducted in TBS (Tris buffered saline) containing 2 mM MgCl\n2\n or 50 mM EDTA. In all hydrolysis reactions, ionic strength was fixed at 150 mM with the NaCl of TBS. The antibody was incubated with the nucleic acid at 37℃ for 1 hr. After the incubation, the reaction mixture was treated at 37℃ for 1 hr with trypsin protease (20㎍/㎖) (Sigma, USA) to prevent the phenomenon that the 3D8 antibody-bound nucleic acid remained at an upper position upon agarose gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gel, the samples were stained with ethidium bromide.\n\n\nAlso, some of the variants were examined for RNA hydrolyzing activity. The three variants 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 were subjected, together with 3D8 VL WT and 3D8 VL 3M, to RNA hydrolysis, with RNase A and HW1 serving as controls. As will be demonstrated later, these variants showed good performance on sequence-specific hydrolysis. RNA hydrolysis was performed in TBS containing 2 mM MgCl\n2\n or 50 mM EDTA using the total RNA isolated from HeLa cells.\n\n\nFIG. 8 shows results of the agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA-hydrolyzing activity of the 11 variants (A) and for RNA-hydrolyzing activity of 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 (B).\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 8, seven (4MG2, 4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH1, 4MH2, 4MH3 and 4MH5) of the 11 variants were found to have DNA-hydrolyzing activity and the remaining four (4MG1, 4MG4, 4MG6, and 4MH4) were significantly lower in hydrolyzing activity, compared to \n3D8 VL\n 4M (A). RNase A hydrolyzed almost all RNAs while HW1 could not, like the buffer control. On the other hand, the variants exhibited RNA-hydrolyzing activity even in the present of EDTA, like WT, 4M and RNase A (B).\n\n\nTherefore, the variants according to the present invention can hydrolyze both DNA and RNA in vitro.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n\n\n : Sequence-Specific, Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Activity of Selected Variants\n\n\n\n\nThe variants proven for nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity were examined for sequence specificity in accordance with the purpose of the present invention. The purified variants were incubated with fluorescence-labeled primers, followed by the analysis of fluorescent signals using a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based cleavage assay. The primers were double-labeled with the green fluorescent 6-FAM at 5'-terminus and its quencher BHQ-1 at 3'-terminus. When the primers remained unhydrolyzed, no fluorescence signals were detected because the fluorescence of 6-FAM was absorbed by the adjacent BHQ-1. On the other hand, when the primers were hydrolyzed at residues between the 5'- and the 3'-end by the variants, the fluorescence signals of 6-FAM could be read because 6-FAM became distant from BHQ-1. In this regard, the primers A\n18\n, T\n18\n, C\n18\n, Her2\n18\n, and N\n18\n, used for library screening, were labeled at respective ends with 6-FAM and BHQ-1. As for G\n18\n, it was substituted with the primer (G\n4\nT)\n3\nG\n3 \nin which a set of 4 guanine residues and one thymine residue was arrayed in tandem because it was difficult to synthesize. The base sequences of the FRET substrates (A\n18\n, T\n18\n, C\n18\n, (G\n4\nT)\n3\nG\n3\n, Her2\n18\n, N\n18\n) used in assay for sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 36 to 41, respectively.\n\n\nThe three variants 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 were found to have sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity as measured by FRET assay. In order to obtain more exact enzyme kinetic parameters, the antibodies at a fixed concentration of 100 nM were incubated with the substrates at various concentrations of from 16 nM to 2 μM during which the dissociation constants of antibodies were measured at each substrate concentration. On the whole, the reaction rate of an enzyme increases with increasing of substrate concentration if other conditions are fixed, but does not significantly increase as it approaches near Vmax.\n\n\nThe antibodies 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) were measured for enzyme kinetics while the FRET substrates (A\n18\n, T\n18\n, C\n18\n, (G\n4\nT)\n3\nG\n3\n, Her2\n18\n, N\n18\n) varied in concentration from 16 nM to 2 μM, and the results are depicted in FIG. 9. Km, Kcat, Kcat/Km values of the antibodies were calculated from the FRET data and given in Table 3, below.\n\n\n[TABLE 3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 9 and Table 3, the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) had much higher Vmax with regard to respective target substrates, compared to 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M, indicating that when sufficient substrates are present, the variants can hydrolyze target substrates faster than other substrates. In contrast, the reaction rates of 3D8 VL WT and \n3D8 VL\n 4M were almost independent of substrate sequences. The kinetic parameters Km, Kcat, and Kcat/Km of the antibodies were calculated from the obtained results. Of the three variants, 4MG3 and 4MG5 hydrolyzed the target G\n18\n with high sequence specific as demonstrated by their higher Vmax for the target G\n18\n than off-targets. As for the 4MH2 variant, its Vmax was higher for the target Her2\n18\n than off-targets, accounting for the specific recognition and hydrolysis of Her2\n18 \nthereby. These variants exhibited lower Km and higher Kcat/Km for target substrates than off-targets. Km means a half of the substrate concentration at which an antibody reach Vmax. Thus, the smaller the Km is, the higher the antibody is in affinity for substrate. The variants 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 had smaller Km values for respective target substrates than other substrates. A difference between the Km and the Kd measured using Biacore2000 is thought to be attributed to the fact that Km does not account for affinity only. The Kcat/Km of the variants was two to five-fold higher for target substrates than off-targets. Higher Kcat/Km values mean more potent hydrolyzing activity for a substrate.\n\n\nConsequently, the variants 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 can specifically recognize and hydrolyze respective target sequences faster than off-targets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\n\n\n: Sequence-Specific, Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Activity of the Variants within Cells\n\n\n\n\nA reporter system with a green fluorescent EGFP gene was employed to evaluate the cytosolic, sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of the variants. The synthetic target sequences G\n18\n and Her2\n18\n were placed between the ATG start codon and the EGFP coding sequence in pEGFP-N1 plasmid to afford pEGFP-N1- G\n18\n and pEGFP-N1-Her2\n18\n, respectively. For use in transfection into mammal cells, 3D8 VL WT and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) were subcloned to respective expression vector pcDNA3.1 (+). In greater detail, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2x10\n5\ncells/well in 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. Once the cells were stabilized, the medium was removed and each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well to obtain maximum efficiency for transfection. 500 ng of pEGFP-N1 alone 500 ng of pEGFP-N1-G\n18\n alone 500 ng of pEGFP-N1-Her\n18\n alone 500 ng of pEGFP-N1 in combination of 500 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-wild type, pcDNA3.1(+)-4MG3, pcDNA3.1(+)-4MG5 or pcDNA3.1(+)-4MH2; 500 ng of pEGFP-G\n18\n in combination of 500 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-wild type, pcDNA3.1(+)-4MG3, or pcDNA3.1(+)-4MG5; or 500 ng of pEGFP-Her2\n18\n in combination with 500 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-wild type or pcDNA3.1(+)-4MH2 were reacted at room temperature for 20 min with 5 ㎕ of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) in 200 ㎕ of TOM medium and added to each well. Following incubation at 37℃ for 6 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n, the TOM medium was changed with 2 ㎖ of 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM. 24 Hours post transfection, the medium was removed and cells were obtained with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. GFP fluorescence was measured from each sample using FACS Caliber (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter).\n\n\nEach transfected sample was treated with rabbit anti-3D8 polyclonal antibody and subsequently with a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody to stain 3D8 VL wild-type, 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. A confocal microscope was used to determine the expression levels of EGFP (green), and 3D8 VL wild-type, 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 proteins (red).\n\n\nProteins and total RNAs were isolated from each transfected sample and subjected to Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively, to examine the EGFP reduction by 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) at protein and mRNA levels.\n\n\nWith reference to FIG. 10, plasmids for the cytosolic expression of 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5) (A, pcDNA3.1), GFP (B, pEGFP-N1), GFP (C, pG\n18\n-EGFP in which G\n18 \nis located in the N-terminal upstream of EGFP), and EGFP (D, pHer2\n18\n-EGFP in which Her2\n18 \nis located in the N-terminal upstream of EGFP) are shown.\n\n\nFIG. 11 shows the expression levels of reporter EGFP containing the target base sequence by 3D8 VL variants when 3D8 VL wild-type or the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2), and various EGFP reporter gene (EGFP, G\n18\n-EGFP, Her2\n18\n-EGFP) were transfected by the expression vectors of FIG. 10 in HeLa cells, in terms of fluorescence level through FACS (A), confocal microscopy (B), Western blotting (C, D) and RT-PCR (E, F).\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 11A, the expression level of EGFP did not significantly differ from 3D8 VL wild-type to the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) in the absence of G\n18\n and Her2\n18\n. On the other hand, when G\n18\n was located before the 5'-terminus of EGFP, the fluorescence signal of EGFP was detected at a far lower level in the cells expressing the variants (4MG3, 4MG5) than the cells expressing 3D8 VL wild-type. Likewise, cells produced far weaker EGFP signals when they were transfected with a vector in which Her2\n18\n was located before the 5'-terminus of EGFP, along with a vector carrying 4MH2, rather than along with a vector carrying 3D8 VL wild-type. Accordingly, when expressed in the cytosol, the variants 4MG3 and 4MG5 hydrolyze G\n18\n-EGFP mRNA, which contains the target sequence thereof and the variant 4MH2 catalytically acts on Her2\n18\n-EGFP mRNAwhich contains the target sequence thereof, thus reducing the expression levels of the proteins encoded by the mRNAs.\n\n\nAlso, the same results as in FIG. 11A are given in terms of confocal microscopic data in FIG. 11B. In the absence of G\n18\n and Her2\n18\n, no significant differences in EGFP expression level were found between cells expressing 3D8 VL wild-type and cells expressing 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2. In contrast, cells transfected with a vector in which G\n18\n is present before the 5'-terminus of EGFP were found to produce far weaker EGFP fluorescence signals when they expressed 4MG3 or 4MG5, compared to when they expressed 3D8 VL wild-type. Likewise, the cells transfected with a vector in which Her2\n18\n was located before the 5'-terminus of EGFP were measured to produce very lower EGFP fluorescence signals when they expressed 4MH2 than when they expressed VL wild-type. These image results confirmed the data of FIG. 11A, demonstrating that 4MG3, 4MG5, and 4MH2 can recognize respective target sequences and still retain the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity.\n\n\nIn FIG. 11C~11F, the cytosolic expression of the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) caused a decrease in the expression level of GFP as identified at both the protein and mRNA levels. Hence, the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) can recognize specific base sequences and hydrolyze them.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\n\n\n: Assay of Her2 Base Sequence Specific, Hydrolyzing Variant (Expression Vector) for Her2 Downregulation\n\n\n\n\nIn order to evaluate the Her2 downregulation by the variant 4MH2 containing Her2 base sequence specificity and Her2 hydrolyzing activity, an Her2 gene expression vector was transfected into human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), which do not express Her2. Her2 siRNA was used as a positive control for downregulation Her2 mRNA expression. In greater detail, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2×10\n5\n cells/well into 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well, followed by incubation at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. When stabilized, the cells in each well were washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. 500 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-Her2 alone was reacted at room temperature for 20 min with 5 ㎕ of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) in 200 ㎕ of TOM medium in a tube and added to each well, followed by incubation at 37℃ for 6 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. The medium was changed with 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and cells were further incubated for 24 hrs. Then, each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. 800 ㎕ of TOM medium (WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. After having reacted at room temperature for 20 min with 5 ㎕ of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) in 200 ㎕ of TOM medium in a tube, 500 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-wild type, Her2 siRNA or pcDNA3.1(+)-4MH2 was added to each well. Incubation was conducted at 37℃ for 6 hrs in a 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. The medium was exchanged with 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, followed by incubation for 24 or 48 hrs. After removal of the medium, the cells were obtained by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. Total RNA and a protein of interest were isolated from each sample and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, to examine the effects of wild-type, Her2 siRNA, and 4MH2 on Her2 expression at the protein and mRNA levels.\n\n\nReferring to FIG. 12, the effect of Her2\n18\n base sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing 4MH2 in HeLa cells on Her2 gene expression was analyzed for its mRNA level by RT-PCR (A) and for its protein expression level by Western-blotting (B).\n\n\nAs is apparent from the data of FIG. 12, 4MH2 remarkably downregulated Her2 expression whereas no significant changes were obtained by 3D8 VL wild-type. Particularly, 24 hrs post-transfection, it was observed that 4MH2 caused greater downregulation of Her2 than did Her2 siRNA, indicating that 4MH2 can specifically recognize Her2 sequence and hydrolyze it. Also, 4MH2 was observed to downregulate both Her2 mRNA and protein to an extent similar to that caused by Her2 siRNA. Particularly, 24 hrs post-transfection, greater downregulation was detected by 4MH2 than Her2 siRNA.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\n\n\n: Cellular Internalization of the Variants (Proteins) and Pathway thereof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Cell-Penetrating Ability of the Variants (Proteins)\n\n\n\n\n3D8 scFV is known to be able to penetrate into cells. FACS and confocal microscopy were used to examine whether 3D8 VL wild-type and variants thereof could penetrate into cells. In detail, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2×10\n5\n cells/well into 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well and cultured at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. When the cells were stabilized, each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. The cells were treated with the variants (10 μM) before incubation at 37℃ for 2 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. After the removal of the medium, the cells were obtained by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. Each sample was treated with a primary antibody specific for 3D8 scFv and then with a TRITC(red)-labeled secondary antibody to stain 3D8 VL wild-type, 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2. TRITC signals were detected using FACS Calibur (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter). At this time, the cells were trypsinized so as to prevent the detection of the proteins which were not internalized into cells but remained attached on the cell surface.\n\n\nEach transfected sample was treated with a primary antibody specific for 3D8 scFv and then with a TRITC-labeled secondary antibody to stain 3D8 VL wild-type, 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 proteins. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. A confocal microscope was used to determine the expression levels of EGFP (green fluorescent), and 3D8 VL wild-type, 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2 proteins (red fluorescent).\n\n\nFACS data and confocal microscope data on the internalization of 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) into human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) and human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR3) are given in FIGS. 13A and 13B, respectively.\n\n\nAs shown in FIG. 13A, 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) were observed to penetrate into HeLa and SK-BR-3 to similar extents. In other words, the variants have similar cell-penetrating ability, thus indicating that different in cellular internalization level among the variants does not need to be considered for ongoing or future experiments.\n\n\nAs shown in FIG. 13B, red fluorescent represent 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2), and blue fluorescent represent nuleus. Therefore, most of proteins did not penetrate into nuclear membrane, and were translocated into the cytoplasm.\n\n\n\n\n2. Cellular Internalization Pathway of the Variants (Proteins)\n\n\n\n\nTo elucidate the specific internalization mechanism of the variants, cells were pre-treated with the following pharmacological inhibitors for interfering with the three major endocytic pathways: chlorpromazine (CPZ) for inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) for inhibiting caveolae/lipid raft endocytosis, and cytochalasin D (Cyt-D) for inhibiting macropinocycosis. In addition, heparin (100 IU/㎖) was also used to interfere with electrical interaction between the positively charged variants and negatively charged proteoglycans (heparan sulfate) on cell surfaces. In greater detail, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2×10\n5\n cells/well into 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well and cultured at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. After the cells were stabilized, each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. The cells were pre-treated with heparin (5mM), MβCD (5mM), chlorpromazine (10 ㎍/㎖), or cytochalasin D (1㎍/㎖) for 30 min and then with each variant (10μM), followed by incubation at 37℃ for 2 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed with PBS and obtained by treatment with trypsin-EDTA. Each sample was treated with a primary antibody specific for 3D8 scFv and then with a TRITC(red)-labeled secondary antibody to stain 3D8 VL wild-type, 4MG3, 4MG5 and 4MH2. TRITC signals were detected using FACS Calibur (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter). As a control of internalization of 3D8 VLs in HeLa cells, without the trearment of soluble heparin or specific endocytosis inhibitors, 3D8 VLs were internalized in HeLa cells and stained with rabbit anti-3D8 polyclonal antibodies and TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG.\n\n\nFACS data analyzed for effect of pre-treatment of soluble heparin or specific endocytosis inhibitors on the cellular uptakes of 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) are shown in FIG. 13C.\n\n\nAs is apparent from the data of FIG. 13C, the cellular internalization of the variants was not affected by chlorpromazine or cytochalasin whereas pretreatment with heparin or MβCD caused a significant reduction in the cellular internalization of the variants, which demonstrates that the variants primarily electrically interact with cell surface materials such as proteoglycan and then undergo caveolae/lipid raft endocytosis.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\n\n\n: Intracellular Sequence-Specific, Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Activity of the Variants (Proteins)\n\n\n\n\nA reporter gene system was employed to evaluate the cytosolic, sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of the variants. For this, the expression vector pEGFP-N1 carrying an EGFP (green fluorescence) and an expression vector in which 18 guanine residues and a Her2\n18\n gene were located upstream of EGFP were employed. In greater detail, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2×10\n5\n cells/well into 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well and cultured at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. When the cells were stabilized, each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. After having reacted at room temperature for 20 min with 5 ㎕ of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) in 200 ㎕ of TOM medium in a tube, 500 ng of pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-N1-G\n18\n alone was added to each well. Incubation was conducted at 37℃ for 6 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere, after which the medium was exchanged with 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and the cells were further incubated for 24 hrs. Each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37℃ for 2 hrs with the variants (10μM) in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. After removal of the medium, cells were obtained by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. EGFP signals were detected using FACS Calibur (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter).\n\n\nIn addition, total RNAs and proteins were isolated from each sample and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, to examine the downregulation of EGFP by 3D8 VL wild-type and the variants (4MG3, 4MG5) at protein and mRNA levels.\n\n\nAs for the variant 4MH2, it was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western-blotting as follows. In greater detail, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2×10\n5\n cells/well into 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well and cultured at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. After the cells were stabilized, each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. After having reacted at room temperature for 20 min with 5 ㎕ of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) in 200 ㎕ of TOM medium in a tube, Her2 alone(500 nM) or Her2 on combination of siRNA (500 nM) was added to each well. Incubation was conducted at 37℃ for 6 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere, after which the medium was exchanged with 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and the cells were incubated for 24 hrs. Each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37℃ for 2 hrs with 3D8 VL WT and 4MH2 (10μM) in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. After removal of the medium, cells were obtained by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. EGFP signals were detected using FACS Calibur (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter). Total RNA and proteins of interest were isolated from each sample and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.\n\n\nFIG. 14 shows target gene silencing activity of cell-penetrating 3D8 VL variants in HeLa cells expressing exogenous targeted genes. HeLa cells were untransfected ('control') or transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP or G\n18\n-EGFP, and 12 h later either untreated or treated at 37℃ for 2 h with 3D8 VL WT (10μM) and G\n18\n-selective 4MG3 (10 μM) and 4MG5 (10 μM), and further incubated for 12 h before EGFP expression analyses by flow cytometry (A), RT-PCR (B, D), and Western blotting (C, E).\n\n\nAs shown in FIG. 14A, EGFP signal intensity did not significantly differ from 3D8 VL wild-type to 4MG3 and 4MG5 whereas transfection with the vector in which G\n18\n is located upstream of EGFP remarkably decreased EGFP signal intensity from the cells expressing 4MG3 or 4MG5 compared to the cells expressing 3D8 VL wild-type. Hence, upon cytosolic expression, the variants 4MG3 and 4MG5 can hydrolyze G\n18\n-EGFP mRNA having the target base sequence thereof to downregulate EGFP expression.\n\n\nAlso, FIGS. 14B to 14E show the downregulation of GFP by intracellularly expressed variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) at protein and mRNA levels. Hence, the variants (4MG3, 4MG5, 4MH2) are found to have base sequence specificity and nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\n\n\n: Cytotoxicity of the Variants (Proteins)\n\n\n\n\nCytotoxicity of the variants (proteins) were measured. In this regard, cells treated for a certain time with the variants (proteins) were measured for viability by MTT assay.  Human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231) or human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) were plated at a density of 2×10\n4\n/well into 96-well plates containing 200 ㎕ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well and cultured at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. When the cells stabilized, each well was washed with 200 ㎕ of PBS. 80 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. After being treated with each variant (10 μM), the cells were monitored for viability for 24, 48 and 72 hrs.\n\n\nIn order to examine types of the cell death caused by the variants, each sample which had undergone the same procedure as described above was stained with FITC-Annexin V and PI and measured by FACS Calibur (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter).\n\n\nWith reference to FIG. 15, human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231) or human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) treated with the variants were analyzed for viability by MTT assay (A) and FACS (B).\n\n\nAs shown in FIG. 15A, each antibody shows a low level of cytotoxicity. Particularly, the variant 4MH2, which can hydrolyze the Her2 base sequence with specificity therefor, was observed to exert potent cytotoxicity on Her2-expressing SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231, which is coincident with the previous report that Her2-overexpessing cells are decreased in cell viability as Her2 expression decreases. Thus, the downregulation of Her2 expression by 4MH2, in our opinion, decreased the cell viability.\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 15B, each antibody shows toxicity to some degree, with coincidence with the results of FIG. 15A. 4MH2 and Her2 siRNA, both having nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity with specificity for Her2 base sequence, were observed to be toxic to the Her2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. At this time, the cells underwent apoptosis (Annexin V positive).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\n\n\n: Excellent Downregulation of Her2 Expression by the Variants (Proteins) with Her2 Base Sequence-Specific, Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Activity\n\n\n\n\nSK-BR-3, which overexpresses Her2, was employed for evaluating the downregulation of Her2 expression by the variants having Her2-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity. In detail, SK-BR-3 cells were plated at a density of 2×10\n5\ncells/well into 6-well plates containing 2 ㎖ of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS per well and cultured at 37℃ for 24 hrs in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere. When the cells were stabilized, each well was washed with 1 ㎖ of PBS. Then, 800 ㎕ of TOM (Transfection optimized medium, WelGENE Inc., Korea) was added to each well. The cells were incubated with each variant (10 μM) for 2, 12, 24 or 48 hrs. After removal of the medium, cells were obtained by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. The expression levels of Her2 proteins on the cell surface were detected with FACS Calibur (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter).\n\n\nTotal RNA or proteins were isolated from each sample and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, by which the 4MH2 antibody was again observed to hydrolyze nucleic acids, with the retention of base sequence specificity.\n\n\nIn FIG. 16, Her2 expression levels in the presence of 4MH2, cell-penetrating Her2\n18\n-selective variant, having Her2 sequence-specific, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity in Her2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells were analyzed by FACS (A), RT-PCR (B), and Western blotting (C).\n\n\nAs seen in FIG. 16A, 4MH2 selectively decreased the expression level of the cell surface protein Her2. Starting from 2 hrs post-transfection, the time needed for the sufficient internalization of the variants and the downregulation required 48 hrs to reach a peak. Compared to the positive control Her2 siRNA, 4MH2 was observed to exert higher downregulation from an earlier time, indicating the superiority of 4MH2 to Her2 siRNA in terms of activity and time.\n\n\nAlso, FIGS. 16B and 16C show that Her2 expression on cell surfaces was reduced selectively by 4MH2, as in FIG. 16A. Faster and stronger downregulation was observed in 4MH2 than in Her2 siRNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described hitherto, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies in accordance with the present invention can be prepared by modifying a particular site of a cell-penetrating, nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibody which lacks substrate specificity to impart sequence specificity thereto without alteration in nucleic acid-hydrolyzing ability. The engineered nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies, when penetrating into cells by themselves or expressed within cells, bind specifically to single- or double-stranded nucleic acid targets and hydrolyze them, thus downregulating the expression of target genes. Therefore, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies according to the present invention can be an alternative to or a substitute for conventional gene silencing techniques such as siRNA. Particularly, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies of the present invention can downregulate the expression of target proteins or the proliferation of target genomes at RNA or DNA levels, but not at protein levels, by binding specifically to and hydrolyzing RNA or DNA, so that they are useful as therapeutics for cancers and viral diseases. Accordingly, the nucleic acid-hydrolyzing antibodies of the present invention may be developed into novel anticancer drugs or anti-viral drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<160>    41\n\n\n \n\n\n<170>    KopatentIn

Specifically, the present invention relates to a β4 integrin binding protein (Integrin beta 4 binding protein, ITGB4BP) and a derivative thereof, and a recombinant expression vector expressing ITGB4BP and a derivative thereof for preventing and/or treating hypertrophic scar and fibrotic lesions New application in . Background technique \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 纤维化疾病是由于细胞外基质 （extracellular matrix, ECM) 如胶原等 过度沉积而导致组织增生、 变硬及瘢痕形成的的一类病变。 持续的感染、 自身免疫性疾病、 过敏反应、 化学损伤、 辐射和组织损伤等慢性炎症长期 刺激导致成纤维细胞向肌成纤维细胞分化， 造成大量结缔组织沉积形成纤 维化， 从而导致器官功能丧失直至死亡 （1-3 )。 增生性瘢痕是纤维化疾病 的一种， 是由于深部真皮受到热力或者其它形式创伤后， 纤维增生紊乱导 致， 常常引起患者美观和功能上的严重损害 （4)。 在进行增生性瘢痕成纤 维细胞分化的机制研究中我们发现 P311基因 (GenBank ID: hsu36189)与其 有着密切的联系 （5)， 但其具体机制如何， 文献却鲜有报道。 \n Fibrotic diseases are a type of lesion that causes tissue hyperplasia, hardening, and scar formation due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) such as collagen. Long-term stimulation of chronic inflammation, such as persistent infections, autoimmune diseases, allergic reactions, chemical damage, radiation and tissue damage, causes fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts, causing massive connective tissue deposition to form fibrosis, resulting in loss of organ function until Death (1-3). Hypertrophic scars are a type of fibrotic disease caused by fibrotic hyperplasia caused by heat or other forms of deep dermis, often causing serious damage to the patient's aesthetics and function (4). In the mechanism of hypertrophic scar-forming cell differentiation, we found that the P311 gene (GenBank ID: hsu36189) is closely related to it (5), but its specific mechanism is rarely reported in the literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n P311(又名 PTZ17, pentylenetetrazol 17)的编码基因由 Matthieu等于 1993 年首先在胚胎大鼠的脑组织中发现 （6 )。 P311基因定位于 5号染色体 ORF13 , 其完整的基因全长约为 2025bp， 包含 3个开放阅读框， 但仅第一 个阅读框编码含 68个氨基酸的蛋白 P311， 分子量大小为 8KD， 该阅读框在 人和小鼠之间高度保守。 此外， 在人、 小鼠和鸡 P311的 N末端还存在一个 高度保守的 PEST结构域 (富含 Pro, Glu， Ser和 Thr的区域）（7) 。 P311广泛 表达于多种组织， 其中在脑组织尤其是胚胎发育后期的大脑组织与成年期 的小脑、 海马和嗅球中高表达， 同时也表达于肝、 脾、 肾、 眼、 心等器官 与骨髓间充质、 成纤维细胞、 肌成纤维细胞等组织细胞 （6)， 而且 Pan与 Fujitani, Taylor等还分别证实该蛋白能表达于肌成纤维细胞、 神经细胞的 胞浆与胞核中。 P311是机体的一种具有重要生物学作用的细胞因子， 参与 体内细胞分化、调节其它蛋白 /基因转录、创伤修复、肿瘤发生等多种正常 \n\n或异常的生物学活动 （6-9)。 \nThe coding gene for P311 (also known as PTZ17, pentylenetetrazol 17) was first discovered by Matthieu in 1993 in brain tissue of embryonic rats (6). The P311 gene is located on chromosome 5 of ORF13, and its complete gene is about 2025 bp in length and contains three open reading frames, but only the first reading frame encodes a protein of P311 containing 68 amino acids with a molecular weight of 8KD. It is highly conserved between humans and mice. In addition, a highly conserved PEST domain (region rich in Pro, Glu, Ser and Thr) is present at the N-terminus of human, mouse and chicken P311 (7). P311 is widely expressed in a variety of tissues, including high expression in brain tissue, especially in the late embryonic development, and in adult cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. It is also expressed in the liver, spleen, kidney, eye, heart and other organs and bone marrow. Tissue cells such as mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts (6), and Pan and Fujitani, Taylor et al. also confirmed that the protein can be expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of myofibroblasts and nerve cells, respectively. P311 is a biological cytokine of the body that participates in cell differentiation, regulates other protein/gene transcription, wound repair, tumorigenesis, etc.  Or abnormal biological activity (6-9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 我们利用酵母双杂交技术筛选了成人肝 cDNA文库（美国 BD Clontech 公司） 中能与 P311 相互作用的蛋白的编码序列， 经过生物信息学分析、 回复性验证和激光共聚焦共定位检测后获得了一个目的基因， 其编码的蛋 白是： β4整合素结合蛋白 （Integrin beta 4 binding protein, ITGB4BP, SEQ ID NO 1 ) ( 10)。 研究提示该蛋白在细胞骨架形成及细胞凋亡中起着重要 的作用， 并可能在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞分化过程中发挥了重要作用。 以 下就国内外该蛋白相关功能研究进行综述。 \n We used yeast two-hybrid technique to screen the coding sequence of a protein that interacts with P311 in an adult liver cDNA library (BD Clontech, USA). After bioinformatics analysis, resilience verification and laser confocal colocalization detection, we obtained a The gene of interest, which encodes a protein: Integrin beta 4 binding protein (ITGB4BP, SEQ ID NO 1 ) (10). Studies suggest that this protein plays an important role in cytoskeletal formation and apoptosis, and may play an important role in the differentiation of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. The following review of the related functions of this protein at home and abroad is reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 1. ITGB4BP基本特征 \n 1. ITGB4BP basic features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 1.1 ITGB4BP的编码基因： \n 1.1 The coding gene of ITGB4BP:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Francesca Sanvito等于 1998年通过荧光原位杂交技术发现 ITGB4BP 基因 （SEQ ID NO 2， NCBI Genebank登记号为 NM— 002212) 定位于 20 号染色体的长臂 20ql l.2区， 其 mRNA全长 1108bp, 其开放读框含有 735 个核苷酸 (11)。 ITGB4BP基因有 7个外显子和 6个内含子， 该基因的 5' 端缺少 TATA启动子结合区， CpG岛 (12)。 ITGB4BP基因在真核细胞中序 列保守， 在哺乳动物和酵母中有 72%同源性， 其中有 85 %序列相似 (13)。 ITGB4BP基因除了在人、 小鼠、 大鼠、 非洲爪蟾等脊椎动物中发现外， 在 果蝇、 乌贼、 软疣等非脊椎动物上也发现该基因的存在， 并且该基因的结 构域在哺乳动物及非脊椎动物之间高度保守 (14)。 \n Francesca Sanvito is equivalent to the discovery of the ITGB4BP gene (SEQ ID NO 2, NCBI Genebank accession number NM-002212) by the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique in 1998. The long arm 20ql l.2 region of chromosome 20 has a full length of 1108 bp. The open reading frame contains 735 nucleotides (11). The ITGB4BP gene has seven exons and six introns, and the 5' end of the gene lacks the TATA promoter binding region, CpG island (12). The ITGB4BP gene is sequence-conserved in eukaryotic cells, with 72% homology in mammals and yeast, with 85 percent sequence similar (13). The ITGB4BP gene is found in vertebrate animals such as human, mouse, rat, and Xenopus laevis. The presence of this gene is also found in invertebrates such as fruit flies, squid, and soft mites, and the domain of the gene is breast-feeding. Animals and invertebrates are highly conserved (14).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 1.2 ITGB4BP编码蛋白： \n 1.2 ITGB4BP encoded protein:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n ITGB4BP蛋白 （SEQ ID NO l , Swiss-Prot: P56537.1 , [GI:3122258] ) 也称 EIF6、 p27BBP、 CAB、 EIF3A等， 由 Biffo等于 1997年发现， Biffo 等运用酵母双杂交技术研究整合素 β4与半桥粒形成上的联系时， 发现一 个蛋白与 β4有相互作用， 故而命名为 β4整合素结合蛋白 （Integrin beta 4 binding protein, ITGB4BP)。 ITGB4BP蛋白含有 245个氨基酸， 分子量大 小为 27kd(15)。 该蛋白在蛋白激酶 C的作用下， 通过磷酸化 /去磷酸化介 导信号的传导， 但其具体机制尚不清楚 （12、 16)。 现有的文献资料中对 ITGB4BP的研究主要集中在 ITGB4BP与细胞骨架形成、 癌细胞分化、 蛋 白合成和迁移中。 \n ITGB4BP protein (SEQ ID NO l, Swiss-Prot: P56537.1, [GI: 3122258]) Also known as EIF6, p27BBP, CAB, EIF3A, etc., was discovered by Biffo in 1997, Biffo et al. used yeast two-hybrid technique to study integrin When β4 is linked to hemidesmosome formation, it was found that a protein interacts with β4, hence the name of Integrin beta 4 binding protein (ITGB4BP). The ITGB4BP protein contains 245 amino acids with a molecular weight of 27 kd (15). This protein mediates signal transduction through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation under the action of protein kinase C, but its specific mechanism remains unclear (12, 16). The existing literature on ITGB4BP focuses on ITGB4BP and cytoskeletal formation, cancer cell differentiation, protein synthesis and migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 1.3 ITGB4BP的表达和分布： \n\n ITGB4BP蛋白分布广泛，可以表达在不同的组织，或者同一组织不同 细胞， 或者同一细胞不同周期。 研究证实， 在上皮细胞、 成纤维细胞、 肿 瘤细胞、激活的 T细胞、活化的肥大细胞及肌肉组织纤维中均有 ITGB4BP 蛋白的表达， 也有研究证实只要表达 （χ6β4 整合素的细胞均表达 ITGB4BP(17)\n0\n ITGB4BP蛋白表达在胞浆（中间丝附近） 和胞核 （主要位 于核仁外周） （18)。 在细胞增殖期， ITGB4BP 的表达上调 (19)。 因此可以 提示 ITGB4BP蛋白与细胞骨架及细胞增殖有关。 \n1.3 ITGB4BP expression and distribution:  The ITGB4BP protein is widely distributed and can be expressed in different tissues, or in different cells of the same tissue, or in different cycles of the same cell. Studies have confirmed that ITGB4BP protein is expressed in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, tumor cells, activated T cells, activated mast cells, and muscle tissue fibers, and studies have confirmed that as long as the expression of χ6β4 integrin cells express ITGB4BP ( 17) \n0\n ITGB4BP protein is expressed in the cytoplasm (near the middle filament) and nucleus (mainly in the periphery of the nucleolus) (18). During the cell proliferation phase, the expression of ITGB4BP is up-regulated (19). Therefore, ITGB4BP protein and cytoskeleton can be suggested. Cell proliferation is related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2. ITGB4BP的生物学功能 \n 2. The biological function of ITGB4BP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2.1 参与调控蛋白合成： \n 2.1 Participation in the regulation of protein synthesis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 真核细胞在生长和分化过程中， 基因组中的绝大多数基因不被转录， 只有少数基因能表达， 这些基因经过转录及转录后加工， 变成成熟的 mRNA, 并在细胞质中的核糖体上翻译成多肽链， 形成细胞所需的蛋白。 mRNA的翻译存在多种水平的调控，其中对真核生物翻译起始阶段的调控 是非常重要的一步。 在真核生物翻译起始阶段， ITGB4BP 从核糖体 60s 亚基解聚下来， 促进 40s亚基和 60s亚基结合形成 80s亚基， 从而启动蛋 白质的翻译 (20-23)。 有实验室敲除 ITGB4BP基因后发现核糖体 60s亚基 丢失， 从而证明其对核糖体 60s的形成也具有重要的作用 (18)。 并且对胞 外信号的反应中 ITGB4BP是作为最早的真核细胞翻译起始因子参与调节 蛋白的翻译 (24)。 另一方面， ITGB4BP调控蛋白合成还与其对 microRNA 的调节相关。 ITGB4BP与 RISC ( RNA-induced silencing complex, RNA诱 导沉默复合体） 结合， 特异性地促进相应 microRNA的作用， 从转录水平 上干扰 mRNA形成， 抑制其对应靶蛋白的表达， 反之敲除 ITB4BP后则会 解除 microRNA对靶蛋白的表达抑制作用而促进靶蛋白的表达 (25 26)。 \n During the growth and differentiation of eukaryotic cells, most of the genes in the genome are not transcribed, only a few genes can be expressed. These genes are processed by transcription and post-transcription to become mature mRNA and ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Translation into a polypeptide chain to form the protein required by the cell. There are many levels of regulation of mRNA translation, and the regulation of the initial stage of translation of eukaryotes is a very important step. At the initial stage of eukaryotic translation, ITGB4BP depolymerizes from the ribosomal 60s subunit, promoting the binding of the 40s subunit to the 60s subunit to form the 80s subunit, thereby initiating translation of the protein (20-23). A laboratory knockout of the ITGB4BP gene revealed a loss of the ribosomal 60s subunit, suggesting that it also plays an important role in the formation of ribosomal 60s (18). And in response to extracellular signals, ITGB4BP is involved in the translation of regulatory proteins as the earliest eukaryotic translation initiation factor (24). On the other hand, ITGB4BP regulates protein synthesis and is also involved in the regulation of microRNAs. ITGB4BP binds to RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), specifically promotes the action of the corresponding microRNA, interferes with mRNA formation at the transcriptional level, inhibits the expression of its corresponding target protein, and vice versa when ITB4BP is knocked out. The microRNA inhibits the expression of the target protein and promotes the expression of the target protein (25 26).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2.2 参与调节细胞黏附及细胞骨架的形成： \n 2.2 Participate in regulating cell adhesion and cytoskeletal formation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 整合素家族为黏附分子受体， 参与介导细胞与细胞外基质、 细胞与细 胞间的相互作用。 细胞间的黏附作用有接合作用、 桥粒连接、 半桥粒连接 等，半桥粒连接的细胞外基质主要为层黏蛋白， β4整合素为层黏蛋白受体， 故其与桥粒、 半桥粒的形成有密切的联系。 ITGB4BP为 β4整合素结合蛋 白， 与中间丝和 α6β4整合素的胞内结构域的功能区结合， 作为两者的桥 梁介导半桥粒的形成， 介导细胞的黏附功能 (15)。 此外， ITGB4BP还存在 \n\n于核基质中， 通过与核基质、 中间丝等细胞骨架结构的连接， 参与了细胞 骨架的形成。有实验已证明 ITGB4BP在中间丝和核基质上高表达 (17)。并 且 ITGB4BP还可以调节 Wnt信号通路中的 β-联蛋白的表达， 从而影响细 胞骨架 (27)。 \nThe integrin family is an adhesion molecule receptor that is involved in mediating the interaction between cells and extracellular matrices, cells and cells. The adhesion between cells has a zygosity, a desmosome junction, a hemidesmosome junction, etc. The extracellular matrix of the hemidesmosome is mainly laminin, and the β4 integrin is a laminin receptor, so it is associated with desmosome and half. There is a close relationship between the formation of desmosomes. ITGB4BP is a β4 integrin-binding protein that binds to the functional domain of the intracellular domain of the intermediate filament and α6β4 integrin as a bridge between the two to mediate the formation of hemidesmosomes and mediate cell adhesion (15). In addition, ITGB4BP still exists  In the nuclear matrix, the formation of the cytoskeleton is involved through the connection with the cytoskeletal structure of the nuclear matrix or intermediate filament. Experiments have shown that ITGB4BP is highly expressed on intermediate filaments and nuclear substrates (17). And ITGB4BP can also regulate the expression of β-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby affecting the cytoskeleton (27).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2.3 与肿瘤发生和转移的关系： \n 2.3 Relationship with tumorigenesis and metastasis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 肿瘤最明显的特点是细胞增殖异常， 凋亡抑制， 且容易转移。 有实验 证实 ITGB4BP作为翻译调节因子参与了细胞的增殖。 在对分化诱导前后 的肝癌细胞核基质成分进行亚细胞蛋白组学分析发现， ITGB4BP在分化后 的细胞中高表达， 提示可能参与癌细胞分化 (28)。 ITGB4BP在正常粘膜细 胞可以检测到， 但是在癌细胞中过表达， 如在结直肠癌中 ITGB4BP的表 达上调 (19)， 并且在淋巴结转移灶中尤为明显 (29)， 故而提示 ITGB4BP的 高表达可能参与了肿瘤的增殖和转移。 \n The most obvious features of tumors are abnormal cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and easy metastasis. Experiments have confirmed that ITGB4BP is involved in cell proliferation as a translational regulator. Subcellular proteomic analysis of the nuclear matrix components of liver cancer cells before and after differentiation induction revealed that ITGB4BP is highly expressed in differentiated cells, suggesting that it may be involved in cancer cell differentiation (28). ITGB4BP can be detected in normal mucosal cells, but overexpressed in cancer cells, such as upregulation of ITGB4BP in colorectal cancer (19), and is particularly evident in lymph node metastases (29), suggesting a high expression of ITGB4BP Participated in the proliferation and metastasis of tumors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 从上面可以看出， ITGB4BP在核糖体合成、细胞骨架以及肿瘤的增殖 分化和转移中具有重要的作用， 但是目前对于 ITGB4BP蛋白的相关文献 较少， 对于其在纤维化相关疾病中的作用和功能还未见报道， 故对其在纤 维化中的功能和作用还需进一步深入研究。 发明内容 \n It can be seen from the above that ITGB4BP plays an important role in ribosome synthesis, cytoskeleton and tumor proliferation, differentiation and metastasis, but there are few related literatures on ITGB4BP protein, and its role and function in fibrosis-related diseases. It has not been reported yet, so its function and role in fibrosis needs further study. Summary of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 本发明人在进行增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞分化的机制研究中发现 P311 基因与其有着密切的联系。 目前对于 P311 基因功能和机制的研究尚不清 楚，本发明人利用酵母双杂交技术在成人肝 cDNA文库（美国 BD Clontech 公司） 中筛选得到一个能与 P311 相互作用的蛋白的编码序列， 经过进一 步鉴定确定该编码序列编码的蛋白为 β4整合素结合蛋白 （Integrin beta 4 binding protein, ITGB4BP， SEQ ID NO 1， Swiss-Prot: P56537.1， [GI:3122258] )。 在此基础上， 本发明人进行了一系列研究， 首次证明 ITGB4BP在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞分化过程中发挥重要作用，进而完成了 本发明。 \n The inventors found that the P311 gene is closely related to the mechanism of differentiation of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts.

Furthermore, the lentiviral vector pFIV-H 1 /U6-copGFP-ITGB4BP NAi related to the ITGB4BP gene was further cloned for RNA interference experiments for the function of ITGB4BP protein and the identification of ITGB4BP gene function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 在本发明的第二方面中， 本发明分离了正常皮肤成纤维细胞和增生性 瘢痕成纤维细胞， 建立了瘢痕细胞模型。 并且， 鉴定 ITGB4BP在上述两 种细胞中的表达水平， 发现 ITGB4BP在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中低表达 (参见图 1 )， 表明 ITGB4BP的低表达加重了增生性瘢痕的纤维化。 \n In the second aspect of the invention, the present invention separates normal skin fibroblasts and hypertrophic scar fibroblasts, and establishes a scar cell model. Furthermore, the expression level of ITGB4BP in the above two cells was identified, and ITGB4BP was found to be lowly expressed in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (see Fig. 1), indicating that low expression of ITGB4BP aggravated fibrosis of hypertrophic scar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 在本发明的第三方面中， 本发明通过 RNAi技术抑制 ITGB4BP在增 生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中的表达后检测纤维化相关的指标 TGF-βΙ (转化生 长因子 βΐ ) 、 ΜΜΡ9 (基质金属蛋白酶 9) 和 I型胶原的表达量。 结果表 明， 在 mRNA水平上抑制 ITGB4BP表达后， 纤维化相关的指标 TGF-βΙ、 MMP9和 I型胶原的表达量升高 （参见图 2) ， 明显加重了纤维化。 \n In the third aspect of the present invention, the present invention detects the expression of fibrosis-related markers TGF-βΙ (transforming growth factor βΐ) and ΜΜΡ9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) by inhibiting the expression of ITGB4BP in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts by RNAi technology. And the expression level of type I collagen. The results showed that the expression of TGF-βΙ, MMP9 and type I collagen was increased in the expression of fibrosis-related indicators after suppression of ITGB4BP expression at the mRNA level (see Figure 2), which significantly aggravated fibrosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 在本发明的第四方面中， 本发明通过在正常皮肤成纤维细胞中增加 ITGB4BP的表达后检测纤维化相关的指标 TGF-pi、 MMP9和 I型胶原的 表达量。 结果表明， 在 mRNA水平上增加 ITGB4BP表达后， 纤维化相关 \n\n的指标 TGF-pi、 MMP9和 I型胶原的表达量显著降低 （参见图 3 ) ， 抑制 纤维化。 \nIn the fourth aspect of the invention, the present invention detects the expression levels of fibrosis-related indicators TGF-pi, MMP9 and type I collagen by increasing the expression of ITGB4BP in normal skin fibroblasts. The results indicate that fibrosis is associated with increased expression of ITGB4BP at the mRNA level.  The expression levels of TGF-pi, MMP9 and type I collagen were significantly reduced (see Figure 3), inhibiting fibrosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 在本发明的第五方面中， 本发明通过在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中高表 达 ITGB4BP后检测肌成纤维细胞表面标志物 α-SMA和纤维化相关的指标 TGF-βΙ和 I型胶原的表达量， 并利用成纤维细胞的三维培养系统（FPCL) 检测对肌成纤维细胞收縮的抑制作用。 结果表明， 与阴性对照相比， 在增 生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中高表达 ITGB4BP后， α-SMA表达量减少 （参见图 4)， 抑制了增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞向肌成纤维细胞的转化； 纤维化相关的 指标 TGF-pl、 MMP9和 I型胶原的表达均被明显抑制 （参见图 5和 6) ， 并且肌成纤维细胞的收缩性下降 （参见图 7) 。 \n In a fifth aspect of the invention, the present invention detects the expression levels of myofibrillar surface markers α-SMA and fibrosis-related indicators TGF-βΙ and type I collagen by highly expressing ITGB4BP in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. And inhibit the contraction of myofibroblasts using a three-dimensional culture system (FPCL) of fibroblasts. The results showed that the expression of α-SMA was decreased after high expression of ITGB4BP in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts compared with the negative control (see Figure 4), inhibiting the transformation of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts into myofibroblasts; The expression of TGF-pl, MMP9 and type I collagen was significantly inhibited (see Figures 5 and 6), and the contractility of myofibroblasts was decreased (see Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 因此， 本发明首次证明 ITGB4BP在体外细胞培养系统中能抑制纤维 细胞、 成纤维细胞、 肌成纤维细胞产生胶原蛋白 （包括 I型、 III型等， 本 文显示了关于 I型胶原蛋白的数据， 未显示关于 III型胶原蛋白的数据）； 首次证明 ITGB4BP能抑制肌成纤维细胞的收缩； 发现 ITGB4BP能下调 TGF-βΚ MMP9的表达。因此，本发明得出这样的结论：在纤维化疾病中， ITGB4BP 的低表达可能是一个调控成纤维细胞表型转化和功能改变的重 要始动因素， ITGB4BP可能是一个具有强烈作用的纤维化形成相关的负调 信号。 因此 ITGB4BP 的高表达则是具有明显的抗纤维化作用。 因此， ITGB4BP 及其基因表达载体可以用于预防和 /或治疗增生性瘢痕疾病或纤 维化病变。 \n Therefore, the present invention demonstrates for the first time that ITGB4BP can inhibit the production of collagen by fibroblasts, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts in an in vitro cell culture system (including type I and type III, etc., herein shows data on type I collagen, Data on type III collagen were shown); ITGB4BP was first demonstrated to inhibit contraction of myofibroblasts; ITGB4BP was found to down-regulate TGF-βΚ MMP9 expression. Therefore, the present invention concludes that in fibrotic diseases, low expression of ITGB4BP may be an important initiating factor regulating phenotypic transformation and functional changes of fibroblasts, and ITGB4BP may be a potent fibrosis. Related negative signal. Therefore, the high expression of ITGB4BP has obvious anti-fibrotic effect. Therefore, ITGB4BP and its gene expression vector can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of hypertrophic scar disease or fibrotic lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 另一方面中， 由于 ITGB4BP基因在真核细胞中的序列高度保守， 其 以 ITGB4BP的结合部位和功能部位发挥生物学作用的天然或基因工程蛋 白质衍生物保留了保守功能结构域， 具有类似的功能， 也可以用于预防和 /或治疗增生性瘢痕疾病或纤维化病变。特别地，具有 ITGB4BP(SEQ ID NO 1 )的结合部位和功能部分， 并且在高表达后能够抑制 TGF 1、 MMP9或 I 型胶原等纤维化相关的指标的表达， 或抑制成纤维细胞表面标志物 a-SMA的表达的 ITGB4BP衍生物都包括在本发明的范围内。 \n On the other hand, due to the highly conserved sequence of the ITGB4BP gene in eukaryotic cells, natural or genetically engineered protein derivatives that play a biological role in the binding site and functional site of ITGB4BP retain a conserved functional domain with similar functions. It can also be used to prevent and/or treat hypertrophic scar disease or fibrotic lesions. In particular, it has a binding site and a functional part of ITGB4BP (SEQ ID NO 1 ), and can inhibit the expression of fibrosis-related indicators such as TGF 1, MMP9 or type I collagen, or inhibit fibroblast surface markers after high expression.

ITGB4BP is underexpressed in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 实施例 5的检测结果显示在图 1中。 图 1显示了 ITGB4BP能够在正 常皮肤和增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中表达， 其代表 mRNA表达水平的原始 相对定量（raw relative quantitation,以下简称原始 RQ)值分别为 1和 0.704， 说明 ITGB4BP在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中低表达。 这表明， ITGB4BP的 低表达可能与增生性瘢痕中过度纤维化有关， 即 ITGB4BP的低表达加重 了增生性瘢痕的纤维化。 \n The test results of Example 5 are shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 shows that ITGB4BP can be expressed in normal skin and hypertrophic scar fibroblasts, which represents the raw relative quantitation (hereinafter referred to as raw RQ) values of mRNA expression levels of 1 and 0.704, respectively, indicating that ITGB4BP is proliferative. Low expression in scar fibroblasts. This suggests that low expression of ITGB4BP may be associated with hyperfibrosis in hypertrophic scars, ie low expression of ITGB4BP exacerbates fibrosis of hypertrophic scars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2. 在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中， 抑制 ITGB4BP表达， 能够加重瘢痕 的纤维性 \n 2. In hypertrophic scar fibroblasts, inhibiting the expression of ITGB4BP can aggravate the fibrosis of scars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 图 2A 对 应 实 施 例 6 的 结 果 ， 表 明 ： 慢 病 毒 ^ -111/1；6 (^0??-1丁0848?1^八〖2#在 mRNA水平对 ITGB4BP的干扰效 \n\n果最好。 具体而言， mRNA水平上阴性对照组为 1.00原始 RQ， 1#慢病毒 载体对 ITGB4BP表达量为 2.068原始 RQ， 对 ITGB4BP不具有干扰效果； 2#载体对 ITGB4BP表达量为 0.025原始 RQ， 抑制率达到 99%， 即最有干 扰效果； 3#载体对 ITGB4BP表达量为 0.253原始 RQ， 抑制率约为 75 %。 图 2B对应实施例 7的结果，表明，在增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞中，在 mRNA 水平上抑制 ITGB4BP表达后， TGF-β MMP9和 I型胶原在增生性瘢痕 成纤维细胞中表达升高， 纤维化加重。 与阴性对照相比， TGF-βΙ 表达量 升高约 5倍， MMP9升高约 4.5倍， I型胶原升高约 6倍， 表明在 mRNA 水平上， ITGB4BP抑制后能明显升高纤维化相关指标如 TGF-pi、 MMP9 和 I型胶原的表达， 明显加重纤维化。 \nFigure 2A corresponds to the results of Example 6 and shows: lentivirus ^ -111/1; 6 (^0??-1 Ding 0848?1^8 〖2# at the mRNA level interferes with ITGB4BP  The best. Specifically, the negative control group at the mRNA level was 1.00 original RQ, and the expression level of 1# lentiviral vector for ITGB4BP was 2.068 original RQ, which had no interference effect on ITGB4BP; the expression of 2# vector to ITGB4BP was 0.025 original RQ, inhibition rate 99%, that is, the most interference effect; 3# vector to ITGB4BP expression is 0.253 original RQ, the inhibition rate is about 75%. Figure 2B corresponds to the results of Example 7 and shows that TGF-β MMP9 and type I collagen are expressed in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts after inhibiting the expression of ITGB4BP at the mRNA level in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. Increased. Compared with the negative control, TGF-βΙ increased about 5 times, MMP9 increased about 4.5 times, and type I collagen increased about 6 times, indicating that at the mRNA level, ITGB4BP can significantly increase fibrosis-related indicators after inhibition. For example, the expression of TGF-pi, MMP9 and type I collagen significantly aggravated fibrosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 3.在正常皮肤成纤维细胞中， 增加 ITGB4BP表达， 能够抑制纤维性 实施例 8的结果显示在图 3中。结果表明，在正常皮肤成纤维细胞中， ITGB4BP mRNA表达升高后， TGF-β MMP9和 I型胶原在正常皮肤成 纤维细胞中表达降低。 具体而言， TGF-βΙ降低约 2倍， MMP9降低约 4.5 倍， I型胶原降低约 6倍， 即 ITGB4BP高表达后能明显抑制纤维化相关指 标如 TGF-β MMP9和 I型胶原的表达， 抑制纤维化。 \n 3. In normal skin fibroblasts, ITGB4BP expression was increased to inhibit fibrosis. The results of Example 8 are shown in Fig. 3. The results showed that TGF-β MMP9 and type I collagen were down-regulated in normal skin fibroblasts after elevated expression of ITGB4BP mRNA in normal skin fibroblasts. Specifically, TGF-βΙ decreased by about 2 times, MMP9 decreased by about 4.5 times, and type I collagen decreased by about 6 times. That is, high expression of ITGB4BP can significantly inhibit the expression of fibrosis-related indicators such as TGF-β MMP9 and type I collagen.

Conversion. After high expression of ITGB4BP in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts, the expression level of a-SMA mRNA was 0.329 original RQ, which was lower than the 1.00 original RQ of the control group, ie, the inhibition rate of a-SMA was 67% (Fig. 4A). The results of Western blotting experiments in Figure 4B also clearly showed that the high expression of ITGB4BP inhibited the expression of a-SMA at the protein level, and further quantified that the relative expression level of a-SMA protein in the high expression group of ITGB4BP was 0.016, which was lower than that of the control group 0.023.

After high expression of ITGB4BP in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts, the contraction index of the three-dimensional gel was 0.23, and that of the control group was 0.90, that is, the contractility of the gel decreased by about 74%. From the above results, it can be seen that in fibrotic diseases, the low expression of ITGB4BP may be an important initiating factor regulating the phenotypic transformation and functional changes of fibroblasts. ITGB4BP may be a strongly involved fibrosis formation. Negative signal. Therefore, the high expression of ITGB4BP has obvious anti-fibrotic effect. Therefore, ITGB4BP and its therapeutic gene expression vector can be used to prevent and/or treat hypertrophic scar disease or fibrotic lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 应该理解， 尽管参考其示例性的实施方案， 已经对本发明进行具体地 显示和描述， 但是本领域的普通技术人员应该理解， 可以在其中进行各种 形式和细节的变化， 而不背离由后附的权利要求所定义的本发明的精神和 范围。 参考文献： \n It will be understood that the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the exemplary embodiments thereof The spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. references: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 1.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis is a continuation application of International Application No. PCT/GB2007/001343 (filed Apr. 12, 2007) which is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/664,137 (filed on May 29, 2007) which is a National Phase Application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/EP2005/010153 (filed on Sep. 20, 2005) which claims the benefit of United Kingdom Patent Application No. 0421838.4 (Sep. 30, 2004), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel markers for cancer, and the use of these markers in assessment of disease conditions and particularly in prognosis and in therapy.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA significant amount of work has been carried out in the art to identify “cancer signatures”, which can be used in patient management or which can identify the targets subverted in neoplasia. These efforts are mainly concentrated on unbiased screening of cancer transcriptomes. For example, one approach is to identify genes whose expression is significantly modified in tumours as compared to normal cells, or in tumours of different grades (e.g., Beer, D. G., et al. 2002\n, Nature Medicine Vol. \n8, No. 8, 816-824) and to select from these a subset which are associated with survival. A difficulty of this approach is that the resultant signatures often represent the end point of complex upstream interactions, and cannot readily be allocated to particular molecular pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach has been used in Brown P O et al (Chang, H. Y., et al. 2004\n, PloS Biol. \n2004 Feb. 2(2): E7). Here, gene expression profiles were obtained from fibroblasts, in response to serum exposure. Genes which formed part of this fibroblast common serum response were found to be regulated in many human tumours. It was proposed that this is due to similarity in the molecular mechanism of cancer progression and wound healing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignatures produced in the prior art are often not highly robust, and often fail to provide good results from datasets that have been obtained in different clinical environments and from different patients. Additionally, prior art signatures often include a large number of genes, which increases the cost and difficulty of clinical screening in patients. In a clinical setting the use of small signatures is desirable as analysis is rendered much easier. For instance, smaller numbers of genes are amenable to analysis with readily available technology such as Real Time PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there is a continuing need to develop new approaches to identifying cancer signatures, so as to identify new diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic markers.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have developed an approach which uses well defined molecular tools capable of forcing terminally differentiated cells in culture to re-enter the cell cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is therefore based in part on a biased method of identifying cancer signatures, in which the examination of the cancer transcriptome is biased towards (or indeed, focused primarily or entirely on) genes which have been shown to be modulated in response to agents which force re-entry of terminally differentiated cells into the cell cycle. This is based on the hypothesis that the molecular tools mimic pathways subverted in naturally occurring tumours and that a limited number of altered signalling pathways lead to the malignant state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have found that the signatures obtained by the method, and in particular by focusing on genes modulated in response to E1A, can provide good indicators for the assessment of cancer and cancer progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the genes identified in such a screen can be more readily reverse engineered into signalling pathways, and thus, pathways of particular interest in human cancers can be identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have identified E1A-modulated genes which are strongly associated with human cancers. Thus, one aspect of the invention concerns methods of assessment of cancer which comprise assessing the status of such genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne particular class of E1A-modulated genes of interest are genes whose expression is not strongly modulated, e.g., induced, by inactivation of a pocket protein, preferably Rb, and which are significantly modulated (e.g., induced) by an E1A pocket binding mutant, particularly the E1A pocket binding mutant YH47. The mutant is described in Wang H G et al, “Identification of specific adenovirus E1A N-terminal residues critical to the binding of cellular proteins and to the control of cell growth”, J Virol. 1993 January; 67(1): 476-88.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have shown that genes in this class, e.g., DDX21, SF3B1, ch-TOG, SKIN, TRPC4AP and SMU-1, are upregulated in a significant proportion of human cancers (relative to normal tissue), and can also be used as predictors of cancer progression. Moreover, this E1A induced pathway appears to represent a useful therapeutic target. The inhibition of expression of an example of this class of genes, SKIN, is able to dramatically reduce proliferation in cancer cell lines overexpressing SKIN while having no effect on normal cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have also identified other classes of genes which are induced by E1A and which can be used as predictors of cancer progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe classes of genes are genes whose expression is\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) strongly modulated, e.g., induced, by inactivation of a pocket protein, preferably Rb, not modulated (e.g., induced) by an E1A pocket binding mutant, particularly the E1A pocket binding mutant YH47 and strongly induced by E2F1 overexpression\n \n(b) strongly modulated, e.g., induced, by inactivation of a pocket protein, preferably Rb, not modulated (e.g., induced) by an E1A pocket binding mutant, particularly the E1A pocket binding mutant YH47 and not (or scarcely) induced by E2F1 overexpression\n \n(c) strongly modulated, e.g., induced, by inactivation of a pocket protein, preferably Rb, modulated (e.g., induced) by an E1A pocket binding mutant, particularly the E1A pocket binding mutant YH47 and not (or scarcely) induced by E2F1 overexpression.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nExamples of genes included in these classes are represented in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the assessment of cancer in a subject, the method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nproviding an assay sample obtained from said subject;\n \ndetermining the expression level in the sample of one or more genes from \nFIG. 2\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably the method involves determining the expression level of a plurality of genes from \nFIG. 2\n (i.e., two or more genes), most preferably 3, 4, 5 or more genes. In some embodiments the method may comprise determining the expression level of 10 or more or 15 or more genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the cancer is breast cancer. In this embodiment, the method may comprise determining the expression level in the sample of at least one (preferably at least two or three) of the ch-TOG, SKIN, and TRPC4AP genes. In respect of breast cancer, the invention may also relate to method for the assessment of cancer in a subject, the method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nproviding an assay sample obtained from said subject;\n \ndetermining the expression level in the sample of one or more genes (preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 or all genes) from table 1.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the cancer is colon cancer. In this embodiment, the method may comprise determining the expression level in the sample at least one (preferably at least two or three) of SKIN, SMU-1 and ch-TOG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the cancer is non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for assessment of NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) in a subject, and preferably a method for assigning a prognosis to the subject, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nproviding an assay sample obtained from said subject;\n \ndetermining the expression level in said sample of at least one gene from table 2 and/or table 3.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt is preferred that the above methods comprise determining the expression level of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 or more, or all, of the genes in table 2 and/or 3. In some embodiments, in the case of the genes of table 3, the method may comprise determining the expression level of at least 15 or 20 of the genes in that table.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have also used an integrated strategy for analysing the cancer transciptome, which integrates meta-analysis of microarray expression data and expression profiling of E1A modulated genes. In doing so, the present inventors have identified further signatures as set out in tables 8, 8a, 8b and 9, associated with NSCLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention also relates to a method for assessment of NSCLC in a subject, and preferably a method for assigning a prognosis to the subject, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nproviding an assay sample obtained from said subject;\n \ndetermining the expression level in said sample of at least one gene from table 8, preferably a plurality of genes.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, the method comprises determining the expression level of a plurality of genes from table 8, i.e., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 of said genes. In some embodiments the method may comprise determining the expression level of at least 15, 20, 25 or 30 of said genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, it may be preferred that the method comprises determining the expression level of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 genes from table 8a. Preferred genes of table 8a may be or include E2F1, MCM6, SF3B1, RRM2 and/or NUDCD1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may alternatively or additionally be preferred that the method comprises determining the expression level of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 genes from table 8b. Preferred genes of table 8b may be or include HOXB7, SerpinB5, E2F4, and/or HSPG2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be preferred that the method comprises determining the expression level of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 genes from table 2, 3 or 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther genes which may be used in some embodiments are those marked with the symbol † in table 8. In some embodiments, the genes for use in the method may include any one of these—e.g., the methods may comprise measuring the expression level of any 5, 8, 10 or more of the genes of table 8 including any one (or 2, 3, 4, 5 etc) of the genes marked with the symbol †.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a kit/apparatus suitable for carrying out any of the above methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a kit for use in assessing cancer in a subject, and preferably a method for assigning a prognosis to the subject, based on a sample obtained therefrom, the kit comprising specific binding partners capable of binding to an expression product of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or more genes) from \nFIG. 2\n;\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 or more genes) from table 2;\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 or more genes) from table 3;\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20 or more genes) from table 8; and/or\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 or 9, or all 10 genes) from table 9.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the case of kits for FISH, the binding partners may be nucleic acids which bind the gene itself, and which are detectably labelled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an apparatus comprising a solid support bearing binding partners capable of binding to an expression product of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or more genes) from \nFIG. 2\n;\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 or more genes) from table 2;\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 or more genes) from table 3;\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20 or more genes) from table 8; and/or\n \none or more genes (preferably each of a plurality of genes, more preferably at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 or 9, or all 10 genes) from table 9.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferred features with regards to the methods described above apply equally to the kit/apparatus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn following the above-described integrated strategy, the present inventors have identified genes which provide a high prognostic power in NSCLC, and in particular which provide a remarkably high prognostic power with a relatively small number of genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have compared the newly-identified signature to the 21 gene signature of table 3 (also described in co-pending application PCT/EP2005/010153). As shown in example 5, unexpectedly, the reduced gene set actually showed an increased prognostic power (sensitivity, accuracy and/or specificity) as compared to the 21-gene set.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the assessment of NSCLC in a subject, most preferably for assigning a prognosis to a subject having NSCLC, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nproviding an assay sample obtained from said subject; and determining the expression level in said sample of a plurality of genes from table 9 (preferably 5 or more; in some \n \n \n \nembodiments\n \n \n \n 6, 7, 8 or 9 or more genes, or all ten genes).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt may be preferred that the genes measured in the method consist of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nno more than 14 (or 13, 12, 11 or 10) genes from table 3, including at least 6 (or 7, 8, 9 or 10) genes from table 9;\n \noptionally other genes (e.g., prognostic genes) not listed in either table 3 or table 9 (in some embodiments, not listed in table 8); and\n \noptionally control genes (controls genes being those not associated with assessment of cancer in the method).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a method for assigning a prognosis to a subject having NSCLC, the method comprising measuring in a sample taken from said subject the expression level of prognostic genes, wherein said prognostic genes include no more than 14 genes from table 3 and wherein said prognostic genes include at least 6 genes from table 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the prognostic genes include at least 7, 8 or 9, and more preferably, all ten of the genes from table 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be preferred that the prognostic genes include no more than 13, 12, 11 or no more than 10 genes from table 3. Where the prognostic genes include no more than 13, 12, 11 or genes from table 3, it may be preferred that at least 8 are from table 9; more preferably this includes 9 or all ten from table 9. Where said prognostic genes comprises no more than 10 genes from table 3, these ten genes may be all ten genes from table 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf course, the method may also comprise measuring genes as controls, wherein in the course of said method no association is made between the expression level of the controls and prognosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the assignment of a prognosis may take account of other factors and clinical parameters such as tumour size, tumour grading, tumour infiltration, and degree of metastasis of the tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prognostic genes may optionally include, in addition, other genes which are not listed in either table 3 or 9, in order to further increase prognostic power (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity and/or specificity). Optionally, the additional genes may be genes other than those listed in table 8. For instance, the prognostic genes may also include p53, KRAS or other markers: e.g., selected from RB, EGFR, MYC, APC, CDH13, RARB, DAPK1, DAPK2, FHIT, RASSF1A, BCL2, ERBB2 (Her2/Neu), GRP, KIT, p21, p27, p16, FAS, CASP3 (Caspase 3), BIRC5 (Survivin), VEGF, PDGF, FGF2, COL18A1 (Collagen XVIII), CCNB1, CCND1, TERT, SEMA3B, PTEN, hOGG1, BAP1, TIMP3, MGMT, FUS1, ROBO1, TSLC1, NPRL2, CYB561D2, GSTP1 and/or MGMT. Accordingly, the prognostic genes measured may consist of: no more than 14 (or 13, 12, 11 or 10) genes from table 3 including at least 6 (or 7, 8, 9 or 10) genes from table 9; plus optionally other genes not listed in either table 3 or table 9 (in some embodiments, not listed in table 8). The genes measured in the method may consist of: no more than 14 (or 13, 12, 11 or 10) genes from table 3, including at least 6 (or 7, 8, 9 or 10) genes from table 9; plus optionally other genes not listed in either table 3 or table 9 (in some embodiments, not listed in table 8); plus optionally control genes (control genes being those not associated with assessment of cancer in the method).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful feature of the present invention is that it provides a small, and hence more clinically useful, signature. Accordingly, it may be preferred that the total number of prognostic genes whose expression levels are measured is 50 or less, more preferably 30 or less, 25 or less, 20 or less, or 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 or less. In some embodiments, the total number of prognostic genes measured may be only 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 (or less). Of course, in any one of these embodiments, the prognostic genes may include 7, 8, 9 or all ten of the genes from table 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the methods mentioned above where the expression levels of genes from table 9 are measured, the genes from table 9 may in some embodiments include one or more, e.g., 2, 3 or all of HOXB7, SerpinB5, E2F4, and/or HSPG2. Additionally or alternatively, the genes from table 9 may in some embodiments include two or more, e.g., 3, 4 or all of E2F1, MCM6, SF3B1, RRM2 and/or NUDCD1. In some embodiments, it may be preferred that the genes from table 9 include HOXB7, SerpinB5, E2F4, HSPG2, E2F1, MCM6 and RRM2, and optionally also SF3B1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a kit/apparatus suitable for use in any one of the above methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides a kit for use in assigning a prognosis to a subject based on a sample obtained therefrom, the kit comprising specific binding partners capable of binding to an expression product of each of a set of prognostic genes, wherein said prognostic genes include no more than 14 (optionally no more than 13, 12, 11 or 10) genes from table 3 and wherein said prognostic genes include at least 6 genes (optionally at least 7, 8, 9 or all ten genes) from table 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of kits for FISH, the binding partners may be nucleic acids which bind the gene itself, and which are detectably labelled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe set of prognostic genes may comprise no more than 50, 30, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the kit could also comprise binding members for controls (genes not associated with prognosis). Thus, in terms of its specific binding partners, the kit may consist of specific binding partners for each of: no more than 14 (or 13, 12, 11 or 10) genes from table 3, including at least 6 (or 7, 8, 9 or 10) genes from table 9; optionally other genes not listed in either table 3 or table 9 (in some embodiments, not listed in table 8); and optionally control genes (controls genes being those not associated with assessment of cancer in the method)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the total number of genes for which binding partners are provided in the kit, including any controls, may be fewer than 50, 30, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 genes (including 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 genes from table 9, optionally 1, 2, 3 or 4 other genes from table 3, plus optionally other prognostic markers and/or controls).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides an apparatus comprising a solid support bearing binding partners capable of binding to an expression product of each of a set of prognostic genes, wherein said prognostic genes include no more than 14 genes from table 3 (optionally no more than 13, 12, 11 or 10 genes) and wherein said prognostic genes include at least 6 genes (optionally at least 7, 8, 9 or all ten genes) from table 9. The apparatus may consist of said solid support bearing binding members for 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 genes from table 9, plus optionally 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 other genes from table 3, plus optionally up to 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 other genes (other prognostic markers not listed in table 3 or 9 and preferably not in table 8 and/or controls).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, preferred features of the methods relate equally to the kits/apparatus suitable for use in such a method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that the prognostic genes of tables 3 and 9 include RRM2. RRM2 is associated with resistance of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine (Zhou, B. S et al. 1995\n, Cancer Res \n55:1328-1333, Goan, Y. G., et al. 1999\n, Cancer Res \n59:4204-4207). In pancreatic adenocarcinomas, direct targeting of RRM2 by siRNA enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine both in vitro and in vivo (Duxbury, M. S et al 2004\n, Oncogene \n23:1539-1548). In NSCLC, gemcitabine is one of the most active chemotherapeutic agents (Natale, R. 2005\n, \nLung Cancer\n \n50 Suppl 1:S2-4). Thus, the finding that RRM2 is overexpressed in NSCLC suggests that the status of RRM2 might influence the decision regarding alternative treatment options in place of gemcitabine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention also provides a method of determining whether or not to treat a subject identified as having NSCLC with gemcitabine or with an agent which inhibits RRM2 protein or which downregulates RRM2 expression (e.g., an antibody, or a nucleic acid inhibitor of expression such an antisense, ribozyme or siRNA molecule), the method comprising determining the status/expression level of RRM2 in a sample obtained from said subject. Preferably, the subject has a stage I tumour, e.g., a stage IA or stage IB tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverexpression of RRM2 may suggest that the subject should not be treated with gemcitabine, or should be treated with an agent which inhibits RRM2 protein or which downregulates RRM2 expression (e.g., in conjunction with treatment with gemcitabine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method may be used in conjunction with any of the methods for assessment/prognosis of NSCLC described herein (in which case, RRM2 should obviously be one of the prognostic genes whose expression level is examined). For instance, the invention provides a method of determining whether a patient would benefit from adjuvant therapy (by assigning a prognosis to the patient), and at the same time determining whether the adjuvant therapy should comprise the use of gemcitabine or an agent which inhibits RRM2 protein/downregulates RRM2 expression.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention will now be described in detail, and with reference to the following drawings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows genes induced by E1A, and the results of RTQ-PCR in E1A (d1520) infected TD C2C12 myotubes, proliferating (MYB) C2C12 myoblasts, E1A (d1520) infected TD MSC (mouse satellite cells) and proliferating (MYB) MSC myoblasts.

J., et al. 2002\n, \nNature\n \n415, 530-6) (B). Data are shown as the probability of remaining free of metastatic relapse, in a Kaplan-Meier plot, as a function of a “favourable” (dashed line), or “unfavourable” (continuous line) signature. (C). Q-RT-PCR analysis of the three predictive class-D genes was performed on 15 randomly selected breast tumour patients (all lymph node negative at diagnosis), which were all homogeneous for estrogen receptor status (ER pos). Five were N0 patients (5-years disease-free patients) and 15 were N0+ patients (patients relapsed with metastatic disease within 5 years). Q-RT-PCR values were normalized to patient 1 (assumed as 1.0). A 50th percentile value was then established for each gene and a matrix was built based on the 50th percentile value, by assigning scores of 0 or 1 to values below of above the threshold, respectively. The sum of the two matrix scores was then used to assign “favourable” (score 0-1) or unfavourable (score 2-3) labels. Probability of remaining metastasis free is shown in the Kaplan-Meier plot as a function of the presence of the “favourable” (dashed line), or “unfavourable” (continuous line) signature. In A-C, the p-values were calculated with the log-rank test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5D\n shows the probability of remaining free of distant metastasis for a patient having a good or bad prognosis based on the Class A, B and C genes predictor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass A, B and C were used together as a predictor of prognostic outcome on a subgroup of breast tumours with no lymph nodes involvement at surgery, which either developed metastatic disease (N0+ patients) or stayed disease-free (N0− patients) over a 5 year follow up period analysed by Affymetrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSKIN knock down by siRNA reduces proliferation in different tumour cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSix different tumour cell lines (as indicated) were treated with SKIN-specific siRNA (empty circles in A; RNAi in B and C), or a control scrambled oligo (filled triangles in A; scr. in B and C) or mock-treated (filled squares in A; mock in B and C). Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were re-plated to measure cell growth (A), or analyzed for SKIN transcript levels by Q-RT-PCR (B). A. Cells, re-plated in standard growth medium, were counted at the indicated time points. Data are expressed relative to the number of cells present in the \nplate\n 24 h after re-plating (assumed as 1). B. Q-RT-PCR data are expressed relative to those detected in growing MCF10A cells, to allow for comparison among cell lines. C.

The average number of SKIN signals/cells was counted, and normalized to the number of signals with chr.8 probe. Samples were considered amplified if >50% of the epithelial cells presented >4 signals/cell. Examples are shown: N, normal epithelium (copies/cell=2); tumour not amplified (copies/cell<4); tumour amplified (copies/cell>4).

The 49-gene model predicts overall survival. The 49-gene model of table 8b was used to predict overall survival in the Stage I subset of lung adenocarcinomas from the Michigan (67 of the 86 patients of the original datasets), Harvard (62 of the 84 patients of the original datasets) and Duke (34 patients) cohorts (Bild, A. H., et al, 2006. Oncogenic pathway signatures in human cancers as a guide to targeted therapies. \nNature \n439:353-357). Data are shown as the probability of survival, in a Kaplan-Meier plot, as a function of a “favorable” (upper line), or “unfavorable” (lower line) signature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n. The 28-gene biased signature and the 80-gene model predict overall survival. The 28-gene biased signature (A) and the 80-gene model (B) were used to predict overall survival in Stage I lung adenocarcinomas of the Duke cohort (34 patients). Data are shown as the probability of survival, in a Kaplan-Meier plot, as a function of a “favorable” (upper line), or “unfavorable” (lower line) signature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n. The 10-gene model predicts overall survival. The 10-gene model was tested to predict overall survival in the indicated cohorts of Stage I (A) and Stage IA (B) lung adenocarcinomas. Data are shown as the probability of survival, in a Kaplan-Meier plot, as a function of a “favorable” (upper line), or “unfavorable” (lower line) signature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n. Performance of the 49-gene model. In A, the 49-gene model was used to predict overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients of the Harvard and Michigan cohorts, as shown. Patients were divided according to tumor stage, and Kaplan-Meyer analyses are shown for Stage I patients, Stage II-III patients, and for the entire cohort (Stage I-II-III). As shown, the 49-gene model had no predictive power in Stage II-III adenocarcinomas. In B, the performance of the 49-gene model is compared to those of the 50- and 100-gene signature of Beer et al. (1) in the prediction of overall patient survival, in the Duke cohort, by Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Upper line—favorable signature; lower line—unfavorable signature (In respect of the Harvard Stage II-III group here and in \nFIG. 14\n, the favourable signature is black and the unfavourable signature is grey.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 14\n. Performance of the 10-gene model on the Michigan and Harvard cohorts. The 10-gene signature was used to predict overall patient survival within the Michigan and Harvard cohorts. In the case of the Michigan cohort, 7 genes could be used (SF3B1, NUDCD1 and SCGB3A1 were not present on HU6800 microarray, used in that study), in the case of the Harvard cohort, 8 genes could be used (NUDCD1 and SCGB3A1 were not present on HU95av2 microarray used in that study). Patients from the two cohorts were grouped according to the tumor stage, as described in \nFIG. 12\n. Remarkably, despite the reduction in the number of genes utilizable, the signature could still predict overall survival in patients with Stage I disease. The prediction in the Duke cohort (all 10 genes could be used in this case) is the same as in \nFIG. 12A\n and is reported for comparison.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDDX21 is \nDeadbox polypeptide\n 21. SF3B1 is splicing \nfactor\n 3b, \nsubunit\n 1. Ch-TOG is colonic and hepatic tumour overexpressed protein and is also known as KIAA097. SKIN (similar to KIAA0493 induced in tumour) is a protein having no previously attributed function. TRPC4AP is the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, \nmember\n 4 associated protein, and is also known as RRIP. SMU-1 is the Suppressor of MEC-8 and UNC-52 homolog. \nFIG. 1\n provides the accession number for the human and mouse sequences, but reference to the gene or protein may include other mammalian sequences. The short names used herein are, for convenience, the names of the human homolog, but this is not intended to exclude other mammalian homologs. \nFIG. 2\n provides the accession numbers for the four classes of E1A-induced genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference to E1A is intended to be reference to any adenoviral E1A expression product capable of inducing re-entry of a terminally differentiated cell into the cell cycle. Preferably, it refers to the E1A 12S mRNA product (which is the short splicing variant), or to a fragment or variant thereof which retains the biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8a, 8b, and 9 provide accession numbers for the genes therein. In all cases, reference to the gene or protein may include other mammalian sequences, i.e., mammalian homologs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccession numbers for mRNA sequences are given above, but gene, transcript or protein may be referred to, as will be apparent from the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssessment of Cancer in a Subject\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA patient or subject as referred to herein is preferably a mammalian patient or subject and most preferably human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA sample or assay sample from said patient or subject is preferably a sample of tumour tissue. In the present application, it will be understood that providing a sample obtained from a patient and determining expression levels in the sample is reference to an in vitro method practiced on a sample after removal of the sample from the body, e.g., by biopsy or during the course of surgery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn assessment of cancer as referred to herein may be diagnosis or prognosis of the cancer. Preferably, the methods are methods of assigning a prognosis to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assigned prognosis may be “good” or “poor” prognosis. In some embodiments, the assigned prognosis may be a probability of survival after a given period of time, e.g., at five years (categorical or numerical probability).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers may be clinically assigned to various stages. The most commonly used staging system for both breast cancer and NSCLC is the TNM system, which is widely described in the art. It may be preferred that the methods are methods of assigning a prognosis to a patient having an early stage cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the sixth edition of TNM, in breast cancer an early stage tumour is defined as a tumour that has not spread beyond the breast or the axillary lymph nodes (Tis, T1, T2, N0, M0).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn lung cancer an early stage tumour is defined as a tumour that has not lymph node metastases or spread is confined to hilar lymph nodes. This includes stage I and stage II lung cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer may be e.g., melanoma, or cancer of the breast, colon, kidney, larynx, lung, prostate, stomach, uterus or brain. In some embodiments, it is preferred that the cancer is NSCLC. Preferably, the cancer is an adenocarcinoma, e.g., an NSCLC adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chance of surviving non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is greatly increased if the disease is caught in the early stages. According to the TNM system, stage I tumours are defined as T1N0M0 (stage IA) or T2N0M0 (stage IB). T refers to the primary tumour as below:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nT1—Tumour with diameter of 3 cm or smaller and surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than lobar bronchus (i.e., not in the main bronchus)\n \nT2—Tumour with any of the following features of size or extent:\n        \n \ndiameter greater than 3 cm;\n \ninvade the visceral pleura,\n \nextend into the main bronchus but remains more than 2 cm from the carina;\n \nassociated with atelectasis, or obstructive pneumonitis but not involving the entire lung;\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nN0 refers to no lymph node involvement and M0 refers to no distant metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment of choice for early stage NSCLC patients is generally surgery alone, since the majority of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy would be exposed to toxicity without any real benefit. Thus, tools which could determine the early stage NSCLC patients who would have the potential to benefit from adjuvant therapy would be highly desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of the present invention are preferably used to assign a prognosis to a patient having a stage I tumour, e.g., a stage IA or stage IB tumour. In some embodiments it may be preferred that the patient has a stage IA tumour. In some embodiments it may be preferred that NSCLC is an adenocarcinoma, e.g., a stage I (A or B) NSCLC adenocarcinoma. In some embodiments, “good” prognosis patients may be advised not to have adjuvant therapy, whereas “poor” prognosis patients may be advised to have adjuvant therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the method may comprise assigning the patient to a treatment group, which may be a “with” or “without” adjuvant therapy group; in other words, the method may comprise determining whether a patient should have adjuvant therapy (by assigning a prognosis to the patient).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvant therapy is therapy applied in addition to a primary therapy (e.g., surgery) and is intended to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Examples of adjuvant therapies include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or hormone therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of the invention may also comprise comparing the protein status or expression level to that of a control sample, as explained in more detail below. When the control sample is a sample of normal cells or a sample of tumour cells having good prognosis, then a poor prognosis may be suggested by a gene status or by a level of a gene expression product which is divergent from the level in the control. When the control is associated with poor prognosis then poor prognosis may be suggested by gene status or a level of gene expression products which is in line with or similar to the control sample. Of course, as explained further below, more than one control may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoor prognosis may be associated with downregulation or upregulation of expression of a given gene, e.g., with downregulation or upregulation of a mRNA or protein expression product, relative to a reference expression level, such as a control or a good prognosis group. When a plurality of genes is measured, patients may be assigned to the poor/good prognosis group depending on the number of genes they have following the poor/good prognosis pattern. E.g., they may be put in the poor/good prognosis class if they have more than 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% or 70% of genes following a poor/good prognosis pattern. The chosen level will depend on the individual circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all of the methods of the present invention, of course, the method may also comprise measuring genes as controls (e.g., housekeeping or universally expressed genes), wherein in the course of said method no association is made between the expression level of the controls and prognosis. The term “prognostic genes” herein is intended to exclude such controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the assignment of a prognosis may take account of other factors and clinical parameters such as the tumour size, tumour grading, tumour infiltration, and degree of metastasis of the tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs well as the expressly mentioned genes, the methods may include measuring other prognostic genes in order to further increase prognostic power (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity and/or specificity). For instance, the prognostic genes may also include p53, KRAS or other markers: e.g., selected from RB, EGFR, MYC, APC, CDH13, RARB, DAPK1, DAPK2, FHIT, RASSF1A, BCL2, ERBB2 (Her2/Neu), GRP, KIT, p21, p27, p16, FAS, CASP3 (Caspase 3), BIRC5 (Survivin), VEGF, PDGF, FGF2, COL18A1 (Collagen XVIII), CCNB1, CCND1, TERT, SEMA3B, PTEN, hOGG1, BAP1, TIMP3, MGMT, FUS1, ROBO1, TSLC1, NPRL2, CYB561D2, GSTP1 and/or MGMT. However, it may be preferred that the total number of prognostic genes (i.e., genes other than controls) whose expression levels are measured is 100, 75, 50 or less, more preferably 30 or less, and in some \nembodiments\n 25 or less, 20 or less, or 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 or less. In some embodiments, the total number of prognostic genes measured may be only 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 (or less). In some embodiments, it may be preferred that the total number genes (e.g., including both prognostic and control genes) measured is 100, 75, 50 or less, more preferably 30 or less, and in some \nembodiments\n 25 or less, 20 or less, or 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of Protein, Gene or Transcript Levels\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of protein, gene or transcript level (to determine expression level) may be made by any of the methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the method may comprise measuring the level of a protein or a nucleic acid, which may be DNA or mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be preferred that the methods comprise direct measurement of the level of a gene expression product. A gene expression product as referred to herein may be a protein or a transcript (i.e., an RNA molecule expressed by the gene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, suitable methods for assessing protein levels include immunohistochemistry (e.g., immunofluorescence), western blotting, and solid phase methods such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing immunohistochemical techniques, an assessment of protein level can be made by determining the proportion of cells showing labelling (e.g., staining or fluorescence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscript level may be determined by in situ hybridisation, e.g., accompanied by assessment of the proportion of cells showing hybridisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, or in addition, quantitative PCR methods may be used, e.g. based upon the ABI TaqMan™ technology, which is widely used in the art. It is described in a number of prior art publications, for example reference may be made to WO00/05409. PCR methods require a primer pair which target opposite strands of the target gene at a suitable distance apart (typically 50 to 300 bases). Suitable target sequences for the primers may be determined by reference to Genbank sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere many different gene transcripts are being examined, a convenient method is by hybridisation of the sample (either directly or after generation of cDNA or cRNA) to a gene chip array and/or micro fluidic card (Low density array). Quantitative PCR methods may use microfluidic techniques, e.g., a microfluidic card.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the method may comprise contacting the sample with a substrate bearing a plurality of nucleic acids. The substrate bears nucleic acids hybridising specifically to transcripts of each of the genes whose expression level is to be detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere gene chip technology is used, the genes may be present in commercially available chips from Affymetrix, and these chips may be used in accordance with protocols from the manufacturer. Generally, examples of methods for the provision of microarrays and their use may also be found in, for example, WO84/01031, WO88/1058, WO89/01157, WO93/8472, WO95/18376/WO95/18377, WO95/24649 and EP-A-0373203 and reference may also be made to this and other literature in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere microfluidic card technology is used, the genes may for instance be present in commercially available microfluidic cards from Applied Biosystem, also known as Low Density Arrays. These cards may be used in accordance with protocol from the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaqMan® Low Density Arrays are customizable, easy-to-use, 384-well micro fluidic cards for real-time PCR-based quantitative gene expression applications (ABI TaqMan™ technology). Over than 40,000 inventoried TaqMan® assays covering human, mouse, and rat genes, are commercially available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe micro fluidic technology uses 8 sample-loading ports, each connected to 48 reaction wells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n384 well TaqMan® array is run on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene copy number may be determined using techniques known in the art, including in situ hybridisation (ISH) with nucleic acid probes which may be labelled with e.g. a fluorescent label (FISH), or PCR of genomic DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference or Control Samples\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a method of the invention comprises determining the gene status of an assay sample obtained from a patient and/or determining the expression level, the method may also comprise comparing the determination made on that sample with a determination made on a reference or control sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference or control samples for the above methods may be a sample of normal (unaffected) cells, preferably cells of the same type as the assay sample. Alternatively, the sample may be a sample of cells affected by cancer, preferably a cancer of the same type as is in the patient or is suspected to be in the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the aim is to distinguish between different states or different levels of aggression of a cancer (e.g., in a method of prognosis), the control sample may preferably be taken from a tumour cell having one of the states of interest. For example, the control sample may be a sample taken from a tumour from a metastatic tumour, or may be a sample from a non-metastatic tumour. For colon cancer, the control sample may be taken from one or more of hyperplastic polyps, adenomas and carcinomas. Generally, the control sample may be a sample of cells from a tissue type associated with the presence or absence of cancer, and/or from a tumour with good or with poor prognosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe control sample may be obtained from the patient, from another subject or from a population of subjects. Where a population of subjects is used, the comparison may be made with the average (e.g., mean or median) in samples of cells from said population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne advantage of using a control of normal tissue from the same patient is that it accounts for any individual variation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the control is from another patient (either of normal or affected tissue), this may also be a reason why results based on a population of patients may be preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the method may comprise the use of more than one control; for example the sample to be tested may be compared to a normal sample from the same patient and the transcript level of an affected sample from another patient or patients. In another example, the sample to be tested may be compared to one or more sample from a metastatic tumour and one or more samples from a non-metastatic tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the assay sample is a sample of affected tissue obtained from the patient, it may be preferred that the control sample is obtained from the patient at an earlier time point, so as to provide a historical record. In one embodiment, this allows for monitoring of the progression of the condition over time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this allows for assessment of the effectiveness of a particular treatment. By comparing the severity of the condition in a patient at two time points, it is possible to determine whether a particular treatment regime is having a positive effect or not. The effectiveness of any one regime may differ from patient to patient, or during the course of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComparison to the gene status or to the level of a gene expression product in a control sample may of course be comparison to previously determined data, and need not comprise the step of analysing the control sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific Binding Partners and Kits/Apparatus\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific binding partner for a protein may be an antibody, as defined below, and is preferably a monoclonal antibody. The antibody may be detectably labelled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the gene expression product is a transcript, the specific binding partner may be a nucleic acid sequence capable of specifically hybridising to said transcript. The nucleic acid sequence may be detectably labelled. It may be a primer or primer pair, e.g., for quantitative PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “specific” is meant a binding partner which is suitable for detection of the transcript or protein in a complex mixture. The binding partner may bind to the gene expression product preferentially over other transcripts/proteins in the same species and may have no or substantially no binding affinity for other proteins or transcripts. In the case of a transcript, the transcript is preferably capable of distinguishing the target transcript from other transcripts in the mixture at least under stringent hybridisation conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various aspects, the invention relates to a kit or an apparatus which comprise a specific binding partner for a gene expression product. In some embodiments, the specific binding partner may be immobilised on a solid support. Thus, the kit for assessment of a sample may comprise an apparatus comprising or consisting of a solid support bearing binding partners for each of the genes of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the specific binding partner is an antibody, the kit may further comprise a detectably labelled moiety capable of binding to a complex between the protein and its specific binding partner. Additionally or alternatively, the kit may include one or more of the following reagents:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) a reagent to fix a tissue, such as paraformaldeheyde;\n \nb) a reagent to “unmask” cellular antigens upon fixation (such as EDTA-based solutions or citrate buffer); and/or\n \nc) a detection system to reveal the enzymatic activity coupled to the primary antibody or the secondary moiety (e.g., secondary antibody), where the label is an enzyme, such as peroxidase.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nFor example, the kit may be for immunohistochemical techniques, and may comprise a first antibody capable of binding the protein to be detected, and a second, labelled antibody capable of binding said first antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the kit may comprise a first, immobilised antibody capable of binding the protein to be detected and a second, labelled antibody capable of binding the protein when bound to the first antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA label may be a radioactive, fluorescent chemiluminescent or enzyme label. Radioactive labels can be detected using a scintillation counter or other radiation counting device, fluorescent labels using a laser and confocal microscope, and enzyme labels by the action of an enzyme label on a substrate, typically to produce a colour change. After the binding reaction and any necessary separation step has taken place, the result of the assay is obtained by contacting the enzyme with a substrate on which it can act to produce an observable result such as a colour change, the extent of which depends on the amount of analyte originally in the sample. Suitable enzyme labels may give rise to detectable changes such as colorimetric, fluorometric, chemiluminescent or electrochemical changes, and include horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase, as well as lysozyme (detectable for example by lysis of organisms such as microccocus lysodeikticus), chymotrypsin, and \nE. coli \nDNA polymerase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther possible labels include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes which catalyse reactions that develop or change colours or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods may also be used to detect interaction between the protein and the antibody, including physical methods such as surface plasmon resonance, agglutination, light scattering or other means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the kit may comprise primers for PCR analysis of RNA samples or genomic DNA from patients, i.e., primers which are capable of hybridising to an RNA expression product of the gene in question, or to the gene itself, and of serving as extension primers. Optionally, the PCR may be quantitative PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the kit may be a gene chip array, in which case it preferably comprises a control specific for said at least one transcript; and optionally at least one control for the gene chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the kit may comprise probes for FISH analysis of gene copy number or other genetic alterations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE.g., the kit may comprise nucleic acids capable of binding to each of a set of prognostic genes, wherein said nucleic acids are detectably labelled (preferably fluorescently labelled).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of a relatively small set of genes of use in assessing the conditions discussed above allows the provision of a small chip specifically designed to be suitable for use in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesirably, the number of sequences in the array will be such that where the number of nucleic acids suitable for detection of the marker transcript is n, the number of control nucleic acids specific for individual transcripts is n′, where n′ is from 0 to 2n, and the number of control nucleic acids (e.g. for detection of “housekeeping” transcripts, transcripts having normally high levels in the cell type being assessed, or the like) on said gene chip is m where m is from 0 to 100, preferably from 1 to 30, then n+n′+m represent at least 50%, preferably 75% and more preferably at least 90% of the nucleic acids on said chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe array may comprise binding partners for a total of e.g., less than 1000, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20 or 15 prognostic genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be preferred in general that the kit or apparatus comprises binding partners for no more than 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 30, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 prognostic genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the kit or apparatus could also comprise binding members for controls (genes not associated with prognosis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the total number of genes for which binding partners are provided in the kit or apparatus, including any controls, may be fewer than 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 30, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16 or 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of producing antibodies are known in the art. Preferred antibodies are isolated, in the sense of being free from contaminants such as antibodies able to bind other polypeptides and/or free of serum components. Monoclonal antibodies are preferred for some purposes, though polyclonal antibodies are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the kits comprise more than one antibody, these are preferably mixtures of isolated antibodies as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies may be obtained using techniques which are standard in the art. Methods of producing antibodies include immunising a mammal (e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit) with a polypeptide of the invention. Antibodies may be obtained from immunised animals using any of a variety of techniques known in the art, and screened, preferably using binding of antibody to antigen of interest. For instance, Western blotting techniques or immunoprecipitation may be used (Armitage et al, Nature, 357:80-82, 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an alternative or supplement to immunising a mammal with a peptide, an antibody specific for a protein may be obtained from a recombinantly produced library of expressed immunoglobulin variable domains, e.g. using lambda bacteriophage or filamentous bacteriophage which display functional immunoglobulin binding domains on their surfaces; for instance see WO92/01047. Another example of a suitable library is a Llama library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies according to the present invention may be modified in a number of ways. Indeed the term “antibody” should be construed as covering any binding substance having a binding domain with the required specificity, e.g., antibody fragments, derivatives, functional equivalents and homologues of antibodies, including synthetic molecules and molecules whose shape mimics that of an antibody enabling it to bind an antigen or epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample antibody fragments, capable of binding an antigen or other binding partner are the Fab fragment consisting of the VL, VH, C1 and CH1 domains; the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; the dAb fragment which consists of a VH domain; isolated CDR regions and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulphide bridge at the hinge region. Single chain Fv fragments are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibodies in which CDRs from a non-human source are grafted onto human framework regions, typically with the alteration of some of the framework amino acid residues, to provide antibodies which are less immunogenic than the parent non-human antibodies, are also included within the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssay Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides for the use of a protein selected from DDX21, SF3B1, ch-TOG, SKIN, TRPC4AP and SMU-1 or other gene listed in \nFIG. 2\n, a protein of table 2, a protein of table 3 or a protein of table 8 or 9 for screening for a candidate agent for the treatment of cancer in a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a still further embodiment, the invention provides a method of screening for a candidate agent for the treatment of cancer in a patient, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a protein selected from DDX21, SF3B1, ch-TOG, SKIN, TRPC4AP and SMU-1 or other gene listed in \nFIG. 2\n, or a protein of table 2, table 3 or table 8 or 9;\n \nb) bringing the protein into contact with a test agent;\n \nc) determining whether said test agent is capable of binding and/or modulating the activity of the protein.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of screening for a candidate agent for the treatment of cancer in a patient, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nidentifying a gene whose expression is modulated in a terminally differentiated mammalian cell in culture by contacting the cell with E1A so as to cause its re-entry into the cell cycle;\n \nproviding a protein expressed by the gene;\n \nbringing the protein into contact with a test agent; and\n \ndetermining whether said test agent is capable of binding and/or modulating the activity of the protein.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of screening for a candidate agent for the treatment of cancer in a patient, wherein said method comprises\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a transformed cell in culture;\n \nb) bringing said cell into contact with a test agent; and\n \nc) determining whether said test agent is capable of modulating the level of a transcript selected from DDX21, SF3B1, ch-TOG, SKIN, TRPC4AP and SMU-1 or other transcript listed in \nFIG. 2\n, or a transcript of table 2, table 3 or table 8 or 9.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides the use of an agent obtainable in one of the above screening methods for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cancer may be e.g., melanoma, or cancer of the breast, colon, kidney, larynx, lung, prostate, stomach, uterus or brain. In some embodiments, it is preferred that the cancer is NSCLC. Preferably, the cancer is an adenocarcinoma, e.g., an NSCLC adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein used in the above assays may be a mammalian protein, preferably a human protein. It may also be a fragment or variant of the full length mammalian protein. Preferred fragments and variants are those which retain the activity of the mammalian protein. Fragments may comprise at least 10, more preferably at least 20, 30, 40 or 50 consecutive amino acids of the mammalian protein sequence. A variant may have at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% identity to a full length mammalian sequence, preferably to the human sequence, assessed over the full length of the mammalian sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percentage identity of amino acid sequences can be calculated using commercially available algorithms. The following programs (provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information) may be used to determine homologies: BLAST, gapped BLAST, BLASTN and PSI-BLAST, which may be used with default parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein for use in the assay may be fused to a heterologous sequence, e.g., a sequence allowing the protein to be isolated and/or immobilised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of a test agent to bind to the protein may be assessed by any of the methods known in the art. Binding assays may be competitive or non-competitive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay method may comprise determining whether the test agent is capable of inhibiting the protein, or determining whether the test agent is capable of activating the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the gene expression is downregulated in a human tumour, the assay is preferably for an activator of the protein, and the assay preferably involves determining whether the test agent is capable of increasing the activity of the protein. In this embodiment, the assay may be carried out under conditions where the protein normally shows low or no activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the gene expression is upregulated in a tumour, the assay is preferably for an inhibitor of the activity of the protein, and the assay preferably involves determining whether the test agent is capable of reducing the activity of the protein. In this embodiment, the assay may be carried out under conditions in which the protein is normally active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determination of modulation of activity will depend upon the nature of the protein being assayed. For example, proteins with enzymatic function may be assayed in the presence of a substrate for the enzyme, such that the presence of a test agent capable of modulating the activity results in a faster or slower turnover of substrate. The substrate may be the natural substrate for the enzyme or a synthetic analogue. In either case, the substrate may be labelled with a detectable label to monitor its conversion into a final product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor proteins with a ligand binding function, such as receptors, the test agent may be examined for ligand binding function in a manner that leads to antagonism or agonism of the ligand binding property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor proteins with DNA binding activity, such transcription regulators, the DNA binding or transcriptional activating activity may be determined, wherein a modulator is able to either enhance or reduce such activity. For example, DNA binding may be determined in a mobility shift assay. Alternatively, the DNA region to which the protein bind may be operably linked to a reporter gene (and additionally, if needed, a promoter region and/or transcription initiation region between said DNA region and reporter gene), such that transcription of the gene is determined and the modulation of this transcription, when it occurs, can be seen. Suitable reporter genes include, for example, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase or more preferably, fluorescent reporter genes such as green fluorescent protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest agents may be natural or synthetic chemical compounds used in drug screening programmes. Extracts of plants, microbes or other organisms, which contain several characterised or uncharacterised components may also be used. Combinatorial library technology (including solid phase synthesis and parallel synthesis methodologies) provides an efficient way of testing a potentially vast number of different substances for ability to modulate an interaction. Such libraries and their use are known in the art, for all manner of natural products, small molecules and peptides, among others. Many such libraries are commercially available and sold for drug screening programmes of the type now envisaged by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further class of test agents or candidate modulators are antibodies or binding fragment thereof which bind a protein target, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother class of test agents are peptides based upon a fragment of the protein sequence to be modulated. In particular, fragments of the protein corresponding to portions of the protein which interact with other proteins or with DNA may be a target for small peptides which act as competitive inhibitors of protein function. Such peptides may be for example from 5 to 20 amino acids in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides may also provide the basis for design of mimetics, as explained in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other aspects, the invention provides methods comprising the step of providing a transformed cell in culture, and determining whether a test agent is capable of modulating (inhibiting or activating) the levels of a gene transcript.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn such a method, the transformed cell may be a tumour cell, e.g., isolated from a human subject, or may be a cell which has been contacting with a transforming agent or an agent which causes re-entry of a terminally differentiated cell into the cell cycle. For example, the cell may be a cell which has been contacted with an E1A protein as described above, e.g., by infecting the cell with an adenovirus. The cell may be a terminally differentiated cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell based assay methods can be configured to determine expression of the gene either at the level of transcription or at the level of translation. Where transcripts are to be measured, then this may be determined using the methods described above, e.g. on gene chips, by multiplex PCR, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs above, where the transcript is one which is down-regulated in tumours, the assay is preferably for agents which increase the expression of the gene (e.g., by increasing the quantity of the transcript). Such an agent may comprise the coding sequence of the gene itself (i.e., it may be a gene therapy vector). Where the transcript is one which is upregulated in human tumours, the assay is preferably for agents which decrease the expression of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell based assay methods may be used to test agents of the sorts described above. They may also be used to screen further classes of test agents/candidate modulators, including antisense oligonucleotides. Such oligonucleotides are typically from 12 to 25, e.g. about 15 to 20 nucleotides in length, and may include or consist of modified backbone structures, e.g. methylphosphonate and phosphorothioate backbones, to help stabilise the oligonucleotide. The antisense oligonucleotides may be derived from the coding region of a target gene or be from the 5′ or 3′ untranslated region. Test agents may further include RNAi, i.e. short double stranded RNA molecules which are sequence specific for a gene transcript. They may also include ribozymes which specifically target the transcript mRNA, i.e., a catalytic RNA molecule which cleaves other RNA molecules of a particular nucleic acid sequence. General methods for the construction of ribozymes are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents obtained in accordance with the present invention may be used in methods of treating cancer in a patient. Generally, the modulator will be formulated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for a chosen route of administration to a subject. For solid compositions, conventional non-toxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like may be used. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc, a modulator and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound(s) in an amount effective to alleviate the symptoms of the subject being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRoutes of administration may depend upon the precise condition being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesign of Mimetics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce candidate substance have been found in the assays and screens according to the present invention, they may be used to design mimetic compounds for development as drugs. The designing of mimetics to a known pharmaceutically active compound is a known approach to the development of pharmaceuticals based on a “lead” compound. This might be desirable where the active compound is difficult or expensive to synthesise or where it is unsuitable for a particular method of administration, e.g. peptides are unsuitable active agents for oral compositions as they tend to be quickly degraded by proteases in the alimentary canal. Mimetic design, synthesis and testing is generally used to avoid randomly screening large number of molecules for a target property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several steps commonly taken in the design of a mimetic from a compound having a given target property. Firstly, the particular parts of the compound that are critical and/or important in determining the target property are determined. In the case of a peptide, this can be done by systematically varying the amino acid residues in the peptide, e.g. by substituting each residue in turn. These parts or residues constituting the active region of the compound are known as its “pharmacophore”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the pharmacophore has been found, its structure is modelled to according its physical properties, e.g. stereochemistry, bonding, size and/or charge, using data from a range of sources, e.g. spectroscopic techniques, X-ray diffraction data and NMR. Computational analysis, similarity mapping (which models the charge and/or volume of a pharmacophore, rather than the bonding between atoms) and other techniques can be used in this modelling process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a variant of this approach, the three-dimensional structure of the ligand and its binding partner are modelled. This can be especially useful where the ligand and/or binding partner change conformation on binding, allowing the model to take account of this in the design of the mimetic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA template molecule is then selected onto which chemical groups which mimic the pharmacophore can be grafted. The template molecule and the chemical groups grafted on to it can conveniently be selected so that the mimetic is easy to synthesise, is likely to be pharmacologically acceptable, and does not degrade in vivo, while retaining the biological activity of the lead compound. The mimetic or mimetics found by this approach can then be screened to see whether they have the target property, or to what extent they exhibit it. Further optimisation or modification can then be carried out to arrive at one or more final mimetics for in vivo or clinical testing.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided by way of illustration.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \nWe used a cDNA subtraction approach to clone genes whose expression is induced by E1A, concomitantly to its induction of re-entry in the cell cycle of TD myotubes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTD C2C12 myotubes were infected with either the adenovirus d1520 (expressing only the 12S mRNA of E1A) or the control adenovirus d1312 (expressing no E1A mRNA). Only the d1520 infected myotubes displayed 48 h p.i. S-phase re-entry phenotype (about 70%). 2 μg of time course pooled polyA\n+\n RNA from d1520 and d1312 infected myotubes was used as starting material for cDNA retro-transcription (Invitrogen) and subtraction procedures (Clonetech) to obtain a library of about 800 clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE1A induced library was screened by Reverse Northern. 14 filters (7 plates, 2 filter per plate) contained all the cloned sequences as single purified PCR bands and some controls (DNA ladder IX as negative control, adenoviral cDNA and NP95 sequence as positive control, GAPDH as internal standard). Each plate (2 filters) was hybridized in duplicate with two different labelled cDNA pools (d1520 and d1312 infected myotubes cDNA) to fish out by comparing the radioactive signals only the E1A (d1520) induced clones. The single positives clones were picked, then grown and sequenced to retrieve by blast analysis the corresponding gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach gene was then validated by Q-RT-PCR onto RNA from E1A and mock infected myotubes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the Reverse Northern positive E1A induced genes are validated by SYBR GREEN based quantitative RT PCR on RNA from E1A (d1520) infected TD C2C12 myotubes, proliferating (MYB) C2C12 myoblasts, E1A (d1520) infected TD MSC (mouse satellite cells) and proliferating (MYB) MSC myoblasts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows the results of the validation. It shows 55 non-redundant clones of which 29 (henceforth referred to as E1A-induced genes) showed reproducible, and greater than 2-fold, induction, upon E1A expression in both TD C2C12 mouse myotubes and primary TD muscle satellite cells (MSC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the fold values are calculated using as reference mock infected (d1312) myotubes (value 1.00) and as standard mouse GAPDH gene. The values are expressed as average of two independent experiments and standard deviation (SD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 29 E1A induced display different timing of induction after E1A expression onto TD C2C12 myotubes. Two time points were considered: 24 h/EARLY (soon after E1A protein starts accumulating) and 36 h/LATE (immediately before S-phase re-entry). The transcriptional activation of each gene was measured as E1A (d1520) fold induction referred to mock infected myotubes (d1312) of two independent experiments by SYBR GREEN based Q-RT-PCR. A mathematical ratio calculated between 24 h/EARLY and 36 h/LATE E1A induction defined the timing of activation. EARLY=>0,4; LATE=<0,4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf the 29 genes, 14 genes were early-induced and 15 were late-induced by E1A (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf interest, almost all of the E1A-induced genes, were actively transcribed in proliferating myoblasts, indicating that the E1A-induced program proceeds through the reactivation of programs switched off by terminal differentiation and withdrawal from the cell cycle (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\n \n \n \nE1A exerts pleiotropic effects on TD myotubes. It suppresses tissue-specific genes, through its binding to the transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP and MyoD, and reactivates the cell cycle, through a mechanism in which binding to pocket proteins (mainly pRb and p130) and restoration of E2F activity is pivotal. However, the ectopic expression of E2Fs in TD myotubes does not induce S phase, indicating that other E1A-activated pathways are concomitantly needed. Indeed E1A-regulated pocket/Rb-independent mechanisms are known, which involve CycE/CDK2-, CtBP-, TRAPP- or p400-regulated pathways, and other chromatin remodelling activities. While it is unclear how these activities contribute to the creation of a S-phase environment, there is evidence that some of these pocket/E2F-independent pathways contribute to E1A-mediated oncogenesis. In keeping with our initial strategy, we tried therefore to classify the E1A-induced genes according to their upstream mechanism of regulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe employed three strategies in TD myotubes: i) overexpression of E2F1, to identify those genes whose induction is E2F1-dependent, using Ad-E2F1 adenovirus infection (MIO 300) as described in Pajalunnga et al 1998; ii) expression of an E1A mutant (YH47/d1928) that is unable to bind to pocket proteins, to identify genes whose induction is dependent on the interference of E1A with pocket protein activity; iii) removal of the Rb gene in TD myotubes derived from MSC from Rb-floxed mice (Vooijs et al 1998). In this latter case, removal of Rb by Cre recombinase was obtained after the induction of terminal differentiation, in an attempt to mimic the effects of E1A exclusively dependent on interference with Rb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe analysed the expression of the E1A-induced genes under these conditions using Q-RT-PCR, in comparison to the levels obtained upon expression of E1A (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTotal RNA was isolated with the Triazol method (Invitrogen). Two μg of RNA were used, with 100 ng of random examers, in a reverse transcription reaction (SUPERSCRIPT II, Invitrogen). One-tenth ng of cDNA was amplified, in triplicate, in a reaction volume of 20 μL with 10 pMol of each gene specific primer and the SYBR-green PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was carried out on the ABI/Prism 7700 Sequence Detector System (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems), using a pre-PCR step of 10 min at 95° C., followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95° C. and 60 s at 60° C. Specificity of the amplified products was confirmed by melting curve analysis (DISSOCIATION CURVE™ Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems) and by 6% PAGE. Preparations with RNA template without reverse transcriptase were used as negative controls. Samples were amplified with primers for each genes (for details see Q-PCR primer list below) and GAPDH as a housekeeping gene (other housekeeping genes, including rRNA 18S and beta-actin were also tested with comparable results). The Ct values were normalized to the GAPDH curve and the relative expression of each gene was expressed as the ratio relative to mock (d1312) infected myotubes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following major classes of genes could be identified:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass A. Pocket-dependent (not induced by YH47, strongly induced by Rb removal), E2F1-dependent (strongly induced by E2F1 overexpression) genes (7 genes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass B. Pocket-dependent, E2F1-independent (or scarcely-dependent) genes (8 genes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass C. Pocket-indifferent (well-induced by YH47, but also activated by Rb removal). This group of 9 genes is clearly subjected to dual redundant regulation, both pocket-dependent and -independent. Almost all of these genes are E2F1-independent, with the exception of KIAA0648.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass D. Pocket-independent (or substantially-independent) genes. This group of 6 genes is well activated by YH47 and scarcely by Rb removal. In addition almost all of them are E2F1-independent, with the marginal exception of KIAA0097.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA first genetic cluster, comprising class A and B genes, is constituted by “typical” E1A-responsive genes, whose induction is stringently pocket protein-dependent (regardless of the E2F1-dependence). All the early-induced genes belong to this group. Of interest, a subset of genes in this genetic cluster (MCM7, MCM4 and MCM6), which is widely known to be under the transcriptional control of E2F1 in non-post-mitotic cells, does not seem to be responsive to the overexpression of this protein in a TD environment, despite retaining pocket protein-dependence. This result suggests there is a difference in the transcriptional regulation of pocket/E2F genes in reversibly and irreversibly arrested cells, and provides a tentative hypothesis as to why E2Fs are unable to force the re-entry in the cell cycle of TD cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second genetic cluster (class C and D) is made up of pocket-indifferent or pocket-independent genes. It is not clear why all these genes are “late” genes, albeit the correlation is too strong to be due to chance. More importantly, within this cluster, class D genes constitute a transcriptional signature, induced by a well-defined genetic alteration, through a yet unknown mechanism. Since pocket-protein/E2Fs-independent mechanisms are known to contribute to E1A-induced tumourigenesis (Alevizopoulos et al, 1998\n, EMBO J. \n17: 5987-5997; Alevizopoulos et al, 2000\n, Oncogene \n19: 2067-2074; Deleu et al, 2001\n, Oncogene, \n20: 8270-8275; Dorsman et al, 1995\n, J Virol \n69: 2962-2967; Fuchs et al, 2001\n, Cell \n106: 297-307; Sandmoller et al, 1996\n, Mol Cell Biol \n16: 5846-56; Subramanian et al, 1988\n, Oncogene \n2: 105-112), our hypothesis would predict a major involvement of the class D gene signature in human cancers.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\n \n \n \nWe directly tested this possibility by in situ hybridisation on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing hundreds of tumour samples derived from ten different tumours, along with their matched normal counterparts. Fifteen E1A-induced genes were tested, including representatives from all classes. Strikingly all the six class D genes were overexpressed in a significant fraction of cancers, when compared to normal matched tissues (\nFIG. 3\n \na\n). In addition, there was no significant correlation between the tumour proliferative index (as assessed by immunostaining with anti-Ki-67) and the levels of four of six class D genes (SKIN, TRPC4AP, SMU-1 and ch-TOG/KIAA0097), indicating that the overexpression event is not the consequence of the tumour hyperproliferative state (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis contention was further supported by the finding that four of six class D genes (SKIN, DDX21, TRPC4AP and SMU-1) did not behave as cell-cycle regulated genes, while all the Class-A and class-B genes were cell cycle-regulated, and class C marginally cell cycle-regulated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverall, 15 E1A-induced genes, from all classes, were tested by TMA analysis. In particular, LBR, XTP1, MGC22679, KIAA1594, C3Orf4, CML66, FLJ37652 showed low or absent expression in both normal and tumour tissues, indicating that their expression level was below the detection limit of the in situ hybridization technique. Two of the class B genes tested (Np95 and Nasp), showed overexpression in tumours. However, comparably high levels of expression were detected also in the proliferating cells of the normal tissues. Thus Np95 and Nasp cannot be considered truly overexpressed, and their expression probably reflects simply the tumour hyperproliferative state. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that all these genes may still distinguish good and poor prognosis tumour samples using different techniques, especially considering the high proliferative index of very aggressive tumours. Moreover, it is possible that the protein levels of these genes are altered in tumour samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe involvement of the identified cancer signature (class D genes) in the natural history of the tumours was further validated in three sets of experiments. First, we analysed a colon cancer progression TMA containing normal epithelia, hyperplastic polyps, adenomas and adenocarcinomas. All six class D genes were overexpressed in 45-75% of adenocarcinomas. The expression of three genes (SKIN, SMU-1, Ch-TOG/KIAA0097) showed absolute correlation with frank adenocarcinomas (\nFIG. 4\n), whereas TRPC4AP was also expressed in other conditions, despite being significantly more expressed in tumours. (\nFIG. 4\n). Of note, SF3B1 was also overexpressed in adenomas (\nFIG. 4\n), albeit with overall less intense staining than in adenocarcinomas (not shown), consistent with the possibility that its overexpression represents an early event in tumour progression. DDX21 is also overexpressed in adenomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSecond, we extracted data regarding class D E1A-induced genes from data sets of expression profile screenings performed on a large number of breast samples. Two independent data sets were employed, one published by Van't Veer et al (van't Veer, L. G., et al, 2002\n, Nature \n415(31), 530-353) and one generated in-house. In particular, we focused our attention on a subgroup of tumours with no lymph nodes involvement at surgery, which either developed metastatic disease (N0+ patients) or stayed disease-free (N0− patients) over a 5 year follow-up period. Three Class D genes (SKIN, ch-TOG and TRPC4AP) were able to predict the risk of disease relapse with a ˜70% accuracy (\nFIG. 5\n A-B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Class D genes were able to predict the risk of disease relapse with a p-value<0.05 on the data set generated in-house and a p-value<0.04 on the data set from van't Veer. The predictive strength of the 3-genes model was further confirmed by Q-RT-PCR (p-value 0.003) on 15 randomly selected breast tumor patients (all lymph node negative at diagnosis), which were all homogeneous for estrogen receptor status (Er pos) (\nFIG. 5\n C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients having enhanced expression of ch-TOG and SKIN and a reduced expression of TRPC4AP were designated as having a poor prognosis, whereas patients with a reduced expression of ch-TOG and SKIN and an enhanced expression of TRPC4AP were designated as having a “good” prognosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the potential use of class A/B/C as prognosis predictors is a viable option, their predictive ability was tested on a subgroup of tumours with no lymph nodes involvement at surgery, which either developed metastatic disease (N0+ patients) or stayed disease-free (N0− patients) over a 5 year follow up period analysed by Affymetrix. Class A+Class B+Class C genes were able to predict the risk of disease relapse (p-value<0.004, \nFIG. 5D\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally we tested whether class D genes were able to confer a proliferative advantage to tumour cells. As a proof of principle, we focused on the SKIN gene, which showed the most consistent and solid behaviour in all the above described characterizations. The frequent genetic alterations at the SKIN locus predict a mechanistic involvement of this gene in malignant transformation. If so, SKIN overexpression should confer a proliferative advantage to the cell and its functional ablation should revert this phenotype. In order to test this possibility, we selected six cell lines to perform SKIN knock down (KD) by siRNA. Three of the cell lines (HT-29, SKMEL5, and SKBR3) displayed SKIN overexpression (\nFIG. 6\n B-C). Three other tumour cell lines (DLD1, SKMEL28, and MDA-MD415) showed normal levels of SKIN expression (\nFIG. 6\n B-C). Of note, tumour cell lines were selected to represent matched samples (overexpressing/not overexpressing) from the same type of tumour: colon carcinoma (HT29 and DLD1), melanoma (SKMEL28 and SKMEL5) and breast carcinoma (SKBR3, and MDA-MB-415). As shown in \nFIG. 6A\n, the KD of SKIN expression by siRNA dramatically reduced proliferation of all the overexpressing cell lines, whilst a control scrambled oligo had little, if any, effect. Importantly, SKIN KD did not inhibit proliferation of tumour lines displaying no overexpression of SKIN (\nFIG. 6A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA survey of cancer microarray data, available in the public domain (www.oncomine.org), also revealed overexpression of some class-D genes in certain tumours. The results of a meta-analysis regarding class D genes, performed using the ONCOMINE web tool to check for significant regulation of Class-D genes in published expression profile experiments, are shown in \nFIG. 7\n. SKIN (flj23790) analysis could not be performed successfully, since the specific probeset for SKIN is present only in some of the more recent array versions (Affymetrix HG-U133 chip B and HG-U95 chip B) therefore drastically reducing the database size. TRPC4AP did not reach statistical significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFISH Analysis of SKIN was also performed. Genetic alterations at the SKIN locus (on chromosome 8) were sought. Since overexpression is frequently due to increased gene dosage, we focused on SKIN gene amplification. Initially, several cell lines were screened by FISH on metaphase-blocked cells. Multiple SKIN-specific signals were detected in several tumour cells lines (\nFIG. 8A\n), independently of their state of aneuploidy. Moreover, SKIN amplification correlated well with its overexpression in the same cell lines, both at mRNA and protein levels, (\nFIG. 8A\n). Next, SKIN amplification was analysed directly on tumour tissues by in situ interphase FISH on colon specimens. In 6 samples of normal colonic mucosa and in 8 adenomas, no amplification (and no overexpression, as judged by ISH) of SKIN was detected (\nFIG. 8B\n). In colon carcinoma, SKIN amplification (>4 signals/cell) was detected in 7 of 21 cases (33%) (\nFIG. 8B\n. Amplification was restricted to the epithelial components of the sample (\nFIG. 8B\n). In all cases SKIN amplification was accompanied by overexpression, judged by ISH (\nFIG. 8B\n). Interestingly, in a sizable fraction of non-amplified cases (6/14, corresponding to 29% of all analyzed cases), overexpression of SKIN was detected by ISH (\nFIG. 8\n B). Thus, SKIN overexpression can occur in the presence or absence of gene amplification.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\n \n \n \nWe conducted a further screen in the same experimental conditions as before (TD C2C12 myotubes infected with either the adenovirus d1520, expressing only the 12S mRNA of E1A, or the control adenovirus d1312, expressing no E1A mRNA). Instead of using a subtraction library technique, RNAs from control/E1A expressing cells were prepared, and profiled by Affymetrix Genechip technology using standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1134 genes were identified using this approach (including 25/30 genes obtained in the subtraction screening approach).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these genes, markers of particular value in the prognosis of breast cancer and NSCLC were identified as below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBreast Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe used the Affymetrix GeneChip technology (HG-U133 chip A+B) to perform gene expression profiling studies on RNAs prepared from biopsies of an initial group of 46 patients who were estrogen receptor positive with node negative primary carcinomas (N0) at the time of diagnosis, with a >10-year follow up.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis analysis included only patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (20 cases) and patients presently disease-free (26 cases) after a 7.5-12 years period since the resection of the primary tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe values of expression of more than 30,000 genes for each patient were stored and organised as “breast cancer” dataset, as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Human Genome U133 (HG-U133) Set, consisting of two GeneChip® arrays, contains almost 45,000 probe sets representing more than 39,000 transcripts derived from approximately 33,000 well-substantiated human genes. This set design uses sequences selected from GenBank®, dbEST, and RefSeq.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, Apr. 20, 2001). They were then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden Path human genome database (April 2001 release). The HG-U133A Array includes representation of the RefSeq database sequences and probe sets related to sequences previously represented on the Human Genome U95Av2 Array. The HG-U133B Array contains primarily probe sets representing EST clusters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAffymetrix® Microarray Suite version 5.0 was used to normalised and pre-filter the data, with the following procedure:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe detection algorithm of the software was used to calculate a Detection p-value (see Manual for further details) and assign a Present, Marginal, Absent call of the signal for each spot on the array. Features (gene) always called Absent in every arrays were excluded.\n \nThe intensity signal of each transcript probed on the array, should be more than 200 (the range of signal is normally between 10 and 20.000) after MASS computing and normalisation.\n \nThe median intensity of the signals of all the transcripts probed (probe pairs) on the array was computed (global median) and this value is used to divide again the signal of each probe pair. This procedure is called Chip normalisation.\n \nThe median value of a gene probed on different arrays is computed and used to divide the Chip normalised signal of the same gene. This procedure is repeated for every other gene. This is called Gene normalisation.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nHaving obtained the “breast cancer dataset” as described above, we reduced the initial list of 1134 E1A induced genes by filtering out all those genes showing a fold change <1.5 between the patients who developed metastasis within 5 years, and the patients still free of disease during the long-term follow up.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen, we ranked the gene list based on their power to correctly classify the patient outcome (poor prognosis Vs. good prognosis) using the leave-one-out cross validation (KNN-9) statistical algorithm, as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 1134 gene list was reduced to a number of 200 genes, with the following procedure in Genespring 6.2® environment:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. The class prediction isolates a gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. For each sample, it calculates the probability of obtaining the observed number of samples from each class above and below that cutoff mark by chance, using Fisher's exact test (hypergeometric distribution).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Selects the smallest p-value calculated in \nstep\n 2 and converts it into prediction strength by taking negative natural log of the p-value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Repeats steps 1 to 3 until prediction strengths for all genes on selected gene list are calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Ranks the genes according to their predictive strength for each class (200 genes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6. Genes with highest predictive strength for each class are selected equally to generate a final list of best predictor genes. The final number of best predictors is user-specified (13 genes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenespring 6.2® (www.silicongenetics.com) was used to perform the analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe top ranked 13 genes were then selected, and are shown in the table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUGCluster\n\n\nName\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nLLID\n\n\nUGRepAcc\n\n\nLLRepProtAcc\n\n\nCytoband\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.444372\n\n\nGDNF \nfamily receptor alpha\n 1\n\n\nGFRA1\n\n\n2674\n\n\nAF038421\n\n\nNP_665736\n\n\n10q26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.125180\n\n\ngrowth hormone receptor\n\n\nGHR\n\n\n2690\n\n\nNM_000163\n\n\nNP_000154\n\n\n5p13-p12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.408182\n\n\ncollagen, type II, alpha 1 (primary\n\n\nCOL2A1\n\n\n1280;\n\n\nNM_001844\n\n\nNP_149162\n\n\n12q13.11-q13.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nosteoarthritis, spondyloepiphyseal\n\n\n \n\n\n4670\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndysplasia, congenital)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.302634\n\n\nfrizzled homolog 8 (\nDrosophila\n)\n\n\nFZD8\n\n\n8325\n\n\nAB043703\n\n\nNP_114072\n\n\n10p11.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.408658\n\n\ncyclin E2\n\n\nCCNE2\n\n\n9134\n\n\nNM_057749\n\n\nNP_477097\n\n\n8q22.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.174312\n\n\ntoll-\nlike receptor\n 4\n\n\nTLR4\n\n\n7099\n\n\nNM_003266\n\n\nNP_612567\n\n\n9q32-q33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.23900\n\n\nRac \nGTPase activating protein\n 1\n\n\nRACGAP1\n\n\n29127\n\n\nNM_013277\n\n\nNP_037409\n\n\n12q13.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.305971\n\n\nsolute carrier family 2 (facilitated\n\n\nSLC2A10\n\n\n81031\n\n\nAF248053\n\n\nNP_110404\n\n\n20q13.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nglucose transporter), \nmember\n 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.165904\n\n\n \nepsin\n 3\n\n\nEPN3\n\n\n55040\n\n\nAK000785\n\n\nNP_060427\n\n\n17q21.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.421337\n\n\nDEP domain containing 1B\n\n\nDEPDC1B\n\n\n55789\n\n\nBC019075;\n\n\nNP_060839\n\n\n5q12.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNM_018369\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.512638\n\n\nTBP-interacting protein\n\n\nTIP120A\n\n\n55832\n\n\nNM_018448\n\n\nNP_060918\n\n\n12q14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.369055\n\n\nATP-binding cassette, sub-family G\n\n\nABCG1\n\n\n9619\n\n\nNM_207630\n\n\nNP_997513\n\n\n21q22.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(WHITE), \nmember\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.409034\n\n\ncollagen, type XV, \nalpha\n 1\n\n\nCOL15A1\n\n\n1306\n\n\nNM_001855\n\n\nNP_001846\n\n\n9q21-q22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe predictor is able to determine the risk to develop metastasis within 5 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpregulation of one or more genes (e.g., of mRNA levels) in table 1 may be associated with worsening of the prognosis. For each of the 13 genes described herein, mRNA upregulation is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients were considered as having a “good” signature if they had lower values of at least 7 of the 13 genes, compared to other individuals in the sample (the “poor” group).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA significant difference was found in the risk of metastasis in the two groups, using the Log-rank test to calculate P-values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a dataset of 67 patients including those which are both estrogen receptor positive and negative (including the 46 patients previously described) the 13 gene predictor of the present invention is able to identify four more patients which went on to develop metastasis, as compared to the Van't Veer predictor. Using the 46 ER positive patients, it is able to correctly identify 6 more patients as compared to the Van't Veer dataset.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the Van't Veer dataset as a test dataset, the percentage of unsuccessfully classified samples has been found to be comparable between the two predictors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is important to note that the Van't Veer predictor comprises 70 genes, whereas the present predictor makes use of only 13. The ability to use a smaller set of genes without comprising accuracy is important in the clinical application of the predictor, diminishing costs and allowing a larger range of techniques to be used. Alternatively, more genes could be added to the set to provide a further improvement in accuracy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression profile of the 13 breast gene predictor on 36 N0 breast cancer patients analysed by Affymetrix was further confirmed by Q-RT-PCR. The classifier performance was also confirmed by Q-RT-PCR. Q-RT-PCR reactions were performed using default settings suggested by Applied Biosystem.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLung Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo of the most comprehensive NSCLCs screenings, with complete follow up information publicly retrievable (Beer, D. G., et al, 2002. Gene-expression profiles predict survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Nat Med, 8: 816-824, Bhattacharjee, A., et al, 2001. Classification of human lung carcinomas by mRNA expression profiling reveals distinct adenocarcinoma subclasses. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98: 13790-13795) were downloaded from the web (www.oncomine.com). These two datasets contain RNA expression values of patients with lung adenocarcinomas from two independent cohorts, and more precisely: the Beer dataset (Affymetrix GeneChip HU6800) is composed by 23 patients with disease-free-survival (DFS) more than 52 months and 18 patients with relapse time (Dead-of-disease) less than 29 months; the Bhattacharjee dataset (Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U95Av2.1) is composed by 33 patients with DFS more than 30 months and 27 with relapse time (Dead-of-disease) less than 25 months.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe datasets were processed as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAffymetrix® Microarray Suite version 4.0 normalised datasets were downloaded from the web.\n \nAll the genes and ETSs showing a negative values after normalisation were excluded from further analysis.\n \nWe considered only the genes having signal on the chip in at least 25% of the patients in each dataset.\n \nThe median value for each gene present on the array was then calculated. We retain all those genes showing a variance of at least 1.5 fold compared to the corresponding median calculated.\n \nThe median intensity of the signals of all the transcripts probed (probe pairs) on the array was computed (global median) and this value is used to divide again the signal of each probe pair. This procedure is called Chip normalisation.\n \nThe median value of a gene probed on different arrays is computed and used to divide the Chip normalised signal of the same gene. This procedure is repeated for every other gene. This is called Gene normalisation.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe initial 1134 genes list were filtered as previously described (=>1.5 fold change): the two classes of patients considered in this case (as opposed to the breast cancer patients, where we evaluated the propensity to formation of metastatic tumours) are the Dead-of disease group, and the Disease-Free Survival group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen, on the filtered list, we ranked the genes according to their ability to discriminate between the two sets of patients, by Univariate t-test (p-value less than 0.05).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe performed the same analyses on both published datasets, and then we selected only the top ranked common genes found on both the datasets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe repeated the same ranking analysis, but with a more stringent p-value cut-off (<0.001). Thus, we obtained a list of top ranked genes from the merged datasets. At the end, we reduced these lists of genes to a final list of 12 genes (lung predictor) by different Class prediction statistical algorithms (Analyses were performed using BRB ArrayTools).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genes are shown in table 2, below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUGCluster\n\n\nName\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nLLID\n\n\nUGRepAcc\n\n\nLLRepProtAcc\n\n\nCytoband\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.108371\n\n\n \nE2F transcription factor\n 4,\n\n\nE2F4\n\n\n1874\n\n\nNM_001950\n\n\nNP_001941\n\n\n16q21-q22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\np107/p130-binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.155048\n\n\nLutheran blood group (Auberger b\n\n\nLU\n\n\n4059\n\n\nBC050450\n\n\nNP_005572\n\n\n19q13.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nantigen included)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.245540\n\n\nADP-ribosylation factor-like 4A\n\n\nARL4A\n\n\n10124\n\n\nNM_005738\n\n\nNP_997625\n\n\n7p21-p15.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.334534\n\n\nglucosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase\n\n\nGNS\n\n\n2799\n\n\nNM_002076\n\n\nNP_002067\n\n\n12q14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(Sanfilippo disease IIID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.409934\n\n\nmajor histocompatibility complex,\n\n\nHLA-DQB1\n\n\n3119\n\n\nBM701265\n\n\nNP_002114\n\n\n6p21.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nclass II, \nDQ beta\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.436432\n\n\nraft-linking protein\n\n\nRAFTLIN\n\n\n23180\n\n\nNM_015150\n\n\nNP_055965\n\n\n3p25.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.444439\n\n\nphosphoribosylaminoimidazole\n\n\nPAICS\n\n\n10606\n\n\nBX538303\n\n\nNP_006443\n\n\n4pter-q21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncarboxylase,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nphosphoribosylaminoimidazole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsuccinocarboxamide synthetase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.505806\n\n\npre-B-cell leukemia transcription\n\n\nPBXIP1\n\n\n57326\n\n\nNM_020524\n\n\nNP_065385\n\n\n1q22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nfactor interacting protein\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.55279\n\n\nserine (or cysteine) proteinase\n\n\nSERPINB5\n\n\n5268\n\n\nBX640597\n\n\nNP_002630\n\n\n18q21.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ninhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nmember\n 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.79037\n\n\n \nheat shock\n 60 \nkDa protein\n 1\n\n\nHSPD1\n\n\n3329\n\n\nBC047350\n\n\nNP_955472\n\n\n2q33.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(chaperonin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.79402\n\n\npolymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed)\n\n\nPOLR2C\n\n\n5432\n\n\nBC003159\n\n\nNP_116558\n\n\n16q13-q21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npolypeptide C, 33 kDa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.91747\n\n\n \nprofilin\n 2\n\n\nPFN2\n\n\n5217\n\n\nBC043646\n\n\nNP_444252\n\n\n3q25.1-q25.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe predictor is able to determine the risk to death within 29 months. \nFIG. 9\n shows the survival probability with a good or poor expression signature based on the NSCLC predictor, using the dataset of Beer et al (\nFIG. 9A\n) or the dataset of Bhattacharjee et al (\nFIG. 9B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA significant difference was found between the probability of survival of the two groups, using the Log-rank test to calculate P-values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn respect of table 2, downregulation of HLA-DQB1, LU, GNS, POLR2c, PBXIP1 and RAFTLIN and upregulation of E2F4, PAICS, PFN2, SERPINB5, HSPD1, and ARL4A (e.g., downregulation or upregulation of mRNA respectively) may be associated with a worsening of the prognosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present example, a good signature was considered to be one which has at least 7 out of the 12 genes (i.e., the majority of genes) which are:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1.

The “test” set of patients was composed of 15 patients without evidence of disease (the good outcome group) and 15 patients died of disease (the poor outcome group). The results of the “test” screening confirmed the good performance of our 12 genes classifier (see \nFIG. 9C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in order to test the predictive potential of other candidate genes, the Micro-fluidic Card (Applied Biosystem) technology was employed. Therefore, in this low density array card, in addition to the 12 genes of Table 2, other 38 genes selected from the list of top ranked genes from the merged data sets were also included. The results of the “test” screening showed that a combination of 21 genes (also including 5 of the previously identified 12 genes) (see Table 3 and \nFIG. 9D\n) displayed an improved performance in predicting NSCLC patients' outcome. Moreover, the 21 genes predictor appeared to be a novel prognosis predictor also for early stages NSCLC patients (stage I).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUGCluster\n\n\nName\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nLLID\n\n\nUGRepAcc\n\n\nLLRepProtAcc\n\n\nCytoband\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.96055\n\n\nE2F transcription\n\n\nE2F1\n\n\n1869\n\n\nBC050369\n\n\nNP_005216\n\n\n20q11.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfactor 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.438720\n\n\nMCM7 minichromosome\n\n\nMCM7\n\n\n4176\n\n\nNM_182776\n\n\nNP_877577\n\n\n7q21.3-q22.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmaintenance deficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7 (\nS. cerevisiae\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.226390\n\n\nRibonucleotide\n\n\nRRM2\n\n\n6241\n\n\nAK123010\n\n\nNP_001025\n\n\n2p25-p24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreductase M2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npolypeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.460184\n\n\nMCM4 minichromosome\n\n\nMCM4\n\n\n4173\n\n\nNM_005914\n\n\nNP_877423\n\n\n8q11.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmaintenance deficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4 (\nS. cerevisiae\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.444118\n\n\nMCM6 minichromosome\n\n\nMCM6\n\n\n4175\n\n\nNM_005915\n\n\nNP_005906\n\n\n2q21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmaintenance deficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6 (MIS5 homolog, \nS. pombe\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(\nS. cerevisiae\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.550539\n\n\nNudC domain\n\n\nCML66\n\n\n84955\n\n\nBC043406\n\n\nNP_116258\n\n\n8q23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncontaining 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.471011\n\n\nSplicing factor 3b,\n\n\nSF3B1\n\n\n23451\n\n\nNM_012433\n\n\nNP_036565\n\n\n2q33.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsubunit 1, 155 kDa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.529609\n\n\nATPase type 13A3\n\n\nATP13A3\n\n\n79572\n\n\nAJ306929\n\n\nNP_078800\n\n\n3q29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.164021\n\n\nChemokine (C—X—C\n\n\nCXCL6\n\n\n6372\n\n\nBM994397\n\n\nNP_002984\n\n\n4q21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmotif) ligand 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(granulocyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nchemotactic protein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.546852\n\n\nGA binding protein\n\n\nGABPB2\n\n\n2553\n\n\nBC036080\n\n\nNP_852092\n\n\n15q21.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntranscription factor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbeta subunit 2, 47 kDa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.479728\n\n\nglyceraldehyde-3-\n\n\nGAPDH\n\n\n2597\n\n\nNM_002046\n\n\nNP_002037\n\n\n12p13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nphosphate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndehydrogenase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.404321\n\n\nGlycyl-tRNA\n\n\nGARS\n\n\n2617\n\n\nNM_002047\n\n\nNP_002038\n\n\n7p15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsynthetase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.436181\n\n\nHomeo box B7\n\n\nHOXB7\n\n\n3217\n\n\nAK223249\n\n\nNP_004493\n\n\n17q21.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.550478\n\n\nHeparan sulfate\n\n\nHSPG2\n\n\n3339\n\n\nM85289\n\n\nNP_005520\n\n\n1p36.1-p35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nproteoglycan 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(perlecan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.360033\n\n\nDNA replication\n\n\nKIAA0186\n\n\n9837\n\n\nXM_375911\n\n\nNP_066545\n\n\n20p11.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncomplex GINS protein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSF1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.62492\n\n\nSecretoglobin, family\n\n\nSCGB3A1\n\n\n92304\n\n\nBU607563\n\n\nNP_443095\n\n\n5q35-qter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3A, member 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.108371\n\n\nE2F transcription\n\n\nE2F4\n\n\n1874\n\n\nNM_001950\n\n\nNP_001941\n\n\n16q21-q22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfactor 4, p107/p130-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbinding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.409934\n\n\nmajor\n\n\nHLA-DQB1\n\n\n3119\n\n\nBM701265\n\n\nNP_002114\n\n\n6p21.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhistocompatibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncomplex, class II, DQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbeta 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.436432\n\n\nraft-linking protein\n\n\nRAFTLIN\n\n\n23180\n\n\nNM_015150\n\n\nNP_055965\n\n\n3p25.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.55279\n\n\nserine (or cysteine)\n\n\nSERPINB5\n\n\n5268\n\n\nBX640597\n\n\nNP_002630\n\n\n18q21.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nproteinase inhibitor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nclade B (ovalbumin),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmember 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHs.91747\n\n\nprofilin 2\n\n\nPFN2\n\n\n5217\n\n\nBC043646\n\n\nNP_444252\n\n\n3q25.1-q25.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn respect of table 3, downregulation of HLA-DQB1, SCGB3A1 and RAFTLIN and upregulation of PFN2, SERPINB5, E2F4, E2F1, MCM7, RRM2, MCM4, MCM6, CML66, SF3B1, ATP13A3, CXCL6, GABPB2, GAPDH, GARS, HOXB7, HSPG2 and KIAA0186 (e.g., downregulation or upregulation of mRNA respectively) may be associated with a worsening of the prognosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present example, a good signature was considered to be one which has at least 11 genes out of the 21 genes (i.e., the majority of genes) which are:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1.

We note that the interference with distal alterations, in a cancer subverted pathway, might prove rather advantageous for therapeutic purposes. In principle, the interference with an upstream genetic lesion might have undesirable consequences also in normal cells, while the selective intervention on distal branches of a signalling pathway might reduce this possibility, as also supported by the fact that the KD of SKIN specifically inhibited the proliferation of SKIN-overexpressing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass D genes encode for rather heterogeneous proteins, including proteins involved in RNA splicing (SAP1 and Smu-1), a nucleolar RNA helicase (DDX21), a microtubule-associated protein (Ch-TOG), a component of the TNF-R1 pathway leading to activation of NF-KB (TRPC4AP), and a previously unknown protein displaying no distinguishing dominial feature (SKIN). While this heterogeneity, albeit not surprising in a cancer transcriptional signature, cannot be immediately reconciled in a unifying scenario, we also note that recent results unexpectedly involved ribonuclear complexes containing splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins in cytoskeletal regulation leading to cell adhesion (de Hoog, C. L., et al, 2004\n, Cell \n117: 649-662). Thus, it is possible that we have identified a cluster of genes whose regulation is important in determining phenotypes frequently altered in cancer, such as cell adhesion to the substrate and motility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional, we have also shown that other classes of E1A-regulated genes can be used as predictors of the metastatic risk of cancer patients.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nMeta-Analysis of Expression Datasets from Microarray Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “original datasets” included the 86 adenocarcinomas analyzed by Beer et al. [as above, Michigan cohort], and 84 adenocarcinomas selected from a study by Bhattacharjee et al. [as above, the Harvard cohort]. The 84 adenocarcinomas of the Harvard cohort correspond to those selected by Beer et al., for the validation of their prognostic signature. Microarray expression datasets of the Michigan (obtained on the HU6800 Affymetrix chip) and of the Harvard cohorts (obtained on the HU95Av2 Affymetrix chip), and details of patient selection criteria and methods for data normalization can be downloaded from http://dot.ped.med.umich.edu:2000/ourimage/pub/Lung/index.html.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients corresponding to the “original datasets” from the Michigan and Harvard cohorts were divided according to the clinical outcome: patients who died within 30 months were labeled as “bad prognosis”; and patients alive after at least 30 (Harvard cohort) or 50 months (Michigan cohort) were labeled as “good prognosis”. Cut-off values were defined so as to obtain a roughly equal number of patients in the good and bad prognosis groups. A number of patients, who did not fit the cut-off criteria were, therefore, excluded from the analysis. This led to the definition of “reduced datasets” (N=41 and 60, for the Michigan and Harvard cohorts, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroarray expression datasets of a study by Bild et al. obtained on the HU133 2.0 plus Affymetrix chip [Bild, A. H., Yao, G., Chang, J. T., Wang, Q., Potti, A., Chasse, D., Joshi, M. B., Harpole, D., Lancaster, J. M., Berchuck, A., et al. 2006. Oncogenic pathway signatures in human cancers as a guide to targeted therapies. Nature 439:353-357., the Duke cohort] were downloaded from the authors' webpage (http://data.cgt.duke.edu/oncogene.php). Affymetrix CEL format files were processed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite v.5 software (MAS 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalyses of gene expression data were performed using BRB ArrayTools version 3.3.1 developed by Dr. Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam. Microarray spot intensities below the minimum value of 10 (the BRB software default for Affymetrix array analysis) were excluded and arrays were then normalized (centered) using the median value of the signal over the entire array. When we derived the 49-gene signature for the Michigan and Harvard reduced datasets, genes were excluded if less than 20% of their expression data across the patients had at least a 1.5-fold change in either direction from the gene's median value. Genes were also excluded if the percentage of data missing or filtered out exceeded 75%. All data were log-transformed (base 2). The two-sample parametric t-test was used to select significant genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClass prediction analyses were performed with diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA). We estimated the prediction efficiency of the classifiers using the leave one-out cross-validation, and the p-value of each classifier was evaluated by 2000 random permutations of the patient class labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince data obtained with different microarray platforms were used in our study, the Affymetrix NETAFFX™ web analysis tool was used to match probesets to identical genes (https://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/netaffx/index.affx).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients and the IFOM Cohort\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinicopathological data for all patient groups in the present study are below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinicopathological data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIFOM\n\n\nIFOM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nHarvard\n\n\nDuke\n\n\nTrain.\n\n\nVal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncohort\n\n\ncohort\n\n\ncohort\n\n\ncohort\n\n\ncohort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(N = 41)\n\n\n(N = 60)\n\n\n(N = 34)\n\n\n(N = 25)\n\n\n(N = 45)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge - \nYears\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n60\n\n\n61\n\n\n66\n\n\n64\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange\n\n\n41-80\n\n\n33-88\n\n\n43-83\n\n\n51-72\n\n\n48-81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean ± SD\n\n\n61 ± 10\n\n\n62 ± 11\n\n\n65 ± 9 \n\n\n63 ± 6 \n\n\n64 ± 9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex - No(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale\n\n\n16 (39)\n\n\n26 (43)\n\n\n17 (50)\n\n\n23 (92)\n\n\n41 (91)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n\n\n25 (61)\n\n\n34 (57)\n\n\n17 (50)\n\n\n2 (8)\n\n\n4 (9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoking (pack year) - No. (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n3 (7)\n\n\n3 (5)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n≦20 Yr\n\n\n 5 (12)\n\n\n10 (17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21-49 Yr\n\n\n13 (32)\n\n\n20 (33)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n≧50 Yr\n\n\n17 (41)\n\n\n27 (45)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.R\n\n\n3 (7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage - No. (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI*\n\n\n \n\n\n1 (2)\n\n\n 4 (12)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIA\n\n\n16 (39)\n\n\n15 (25)\n\n\n21 (62)\n\n\n 8 (32)\n\n\n13 (29)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIB\n\n\n12 (29)\n\n\n28 (46)\n\n\n 9 (26)\n\n\n17 (68)\n\n\n32 (71)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIIA\n\n\n \n\n\n2 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIIB\n\n\n \n\n\n 8 (13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIIIA\n\n\n13 (32)\n\n\n4 (7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIIIB\n\n\n \n\n\n2 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor stage - No. (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n20 (49)\n\n\n19 (32)\n\n\n21 (62)\n\n\n 8 (32)\n\n\n13 (29)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n16 (39)\n\n\n35 (58)\n\n\n 9 (26)\n\n\n17 (68)\n\n\n32 (71)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n 5 (12)\n\n\n3 (5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n2 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.A.\n\n\n \n\n\n1 (2)\n\n\n 4 (12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodal status - No. (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n28 (68)\n\n\n36 (60)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n13 (32)\n\n\n12 (20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.A.\n\n\n \n\n\n12 (20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Data are reported for the patients included in the reduced datasets of the Michigan and Harvard cohorts, and for all patients of the other cohorts. *Tumor stage (A or B) was not available; N.A., not available)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients within the IFOM cohorts were selected within a consecutive series of 391 stage I (T1-2NOMO) NSCLC patients surgically treated at the Service of thoracic surgery, University of Pisa between 1994 and 1999. Patient stage at the time of diagnosis was determined according to guidelines of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The 70 patients selected for this study (25 and 45 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively) were solely selected on the basis of the histotype (adenocarcinoma), availability of adequate tissue samples (>80% tumor cellularity) and complete follow-up data. Informed consent was obtained from all patients under study. Tumors were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 minutes of excision and stored at −80° C. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, and its quality was evaluated by gel electrophoresis and by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaqMan Low Density Array Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaqMan® Low Density arrays were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Total RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse transcribed with 200 units of Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) and 250 ng random examers, using manufacturer's instructions. A reaction mix containing 75 ng of cDNA and 50 μl of 2×PCR Master Mix (Euregentec) in a final volume of 100 μl was then prepared and loaded in the array. PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50° C., 10 min at 94.5° C., followed by 45 cycles at 97° C. for 30 s and 59.7° C. for 1 min, on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT PCR System.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression level of each gene was measured in triplicate, and a panel of 8 reference genes (RPL14, RPL18, AGPAT1, ACTB, TBP, GUSB, PPIA, 18S) was used. GeNorm software (Vandesompele, J., et al, 2002\n. Genome Biol \n3:RESEARCH0034) was used to evaluate the expression stability of the reference genes. The average Ct value of each target gene was normalized against the geometric mean of the Ct values of the 8 reference genes. Universal Reference RNA (Stratagene) was used as calibrator for all the samples analyzed. The relative fold change of gene expression in lung cancer patients was calculated as 2\n−ΔΔCt \n(ΔΔCt=ΔCt\nsample\n−ΔCt\nuniv-ref\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData were then analyzed using BRB ArrayTools version 3.3.1. Definition of the classifier was performed with the diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) and leave-one-out cross-validation. The p-value was calculated by 2000 random permutations of the class labels. The 45 patients of the IFOM validation cohort were labeled as ‘predict’ in the BRB ArrayTools, to perform a completely ‘blind’ classification of the class labels (good and poor outcome). TaqMan® assay IDs (Applied Biosystems) were: NUDCD1/CML66-Hs00292614_m1, CXCL6-Hs00237017_m1, E2F1-Hs00153451_m1, E2F4-Hs00608098_m1, GABPB2-Hs00242573_m1, HLA-DQB1-Hs00409790_m1, HOXB7-Hs00270131_m1, HSPG2-Hs00194179_m1, MCM4-Hs00381533_m1, MCM6-Hs00195504_m1, MCM7-Hs00428518_m1, RAFTLIN-Hs00412084_m1, RRM2-Hs00357247_g1, SCGB3A1-Hs00369360_g1, SERPINB5-Hs00184728_m1, SF3B1-Hs00202782_m1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Nominal Logistic Regression tool within the JMP IN 5.1 software (SAS).

[as above, henceforth the Harvard cohort].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients (see Methods) were divided into good and bad prognosis groups according to their clinical outcome (see Methods for criteria used). A number of patients, who did not fit the established prognostic criteria, were therefore excluded from the meta-analysis. We refer to the datasets from the initial 170 patients as “original datasets” and to those of the selected patients as “reduced datasets”; each of these datasets included patients with stage I, II and III tumours. The two reduced datasets (Michigan and Harvard) were then analyzed to obtain lists of genes that are differentially expressed between good and poor prognosis patients. A third cohort of patients, from an independent study comprising 34 stage I lung adenocarcinomas [Bild, A. H., et al, 2006 \nNature \n439:353-357, henceforth the “Duke cohort”] was used for validation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also used a biased cancer signature of 28 genes, derived from an experimental model that mimics important cancer-related pathways (Nicassio, F., et al, 2005,—\nJ Clin Invest \n115:3015-3025) and tested/validated its predictive power on the above datasets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, we combined genes from the two analyses, and tested them in a Real Time PCR-based approach on a fourth cohort of patients (the IFOM cohort), to define a predictive model employing a limited number of genes, and a readily accessible technical platform.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeta-Analysis of Two Lung Adenocarcinoma Expression Profile Datasets\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitially, we assumed that a reliable list of genes that are differentially regulated in the good vs. bad prognosis group, should be concomitantly found in independent analyses of the Michigan and Harvard datasets. Therefore, we performed a class comparison test and we identified 361 unique differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, parametric t-test) in the Michigan cohort, and 429 unique differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, parametric t-test) in the Harvard cohort. Twenty genes were shared between the two lists (p<0.05, parametric t-test).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative approach, we assumed that a reliable list of genes should not necessarily be shared by the two independent analyses. Hence, we searched for the most stably differentially expressed genes in each dataset, using a stringent p-value cut-off (p<0.001, parametric t-test). We found 21 unique genes in the Michigan cohort, and 12 unique genes in the Harvard cohort, for a total of 33 unique genes. In total, by combining the two approaches, we identified 49 unique genes (4 were common to both the Michigan and Harvard cohorts), which we refer to as the “49-gene model”. The 49 genes are listed in table 8, source identified as “meta”, and are shown separately in table 8b.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, we analyzed the prognostic predictive accuracy of the 49-gene model with the use of leave-one-out cross-validation (Table 5). Predictive accuracy on the “reduced datasets” was 90% and 72% on the Michigan and Harvard cohorts, respectively (Table 5). On the “original datasets”, predictive accuracy was 69% and 71% on the Michigan and Harvard cohorts, respectively (Table 5). Of note, the 49-gene model performed well when compared with two signatures (of 50 and 100 genes, respectively) derived by Beer et al. from the Michigan cohort (Beer, D. G., et al, 2002\n, Nat Med \n8:816-824). Our model was however more stable when analyzed on the Harvard cohort, as expected since it was derived from meta-analysis of both the Michigan and Harvard datasets (Table 5; see also table 6 for additional controls and analyses).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrognostic predictive accuracy of the 49-gene model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMichigan cohort\n\n\nHarvard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN = 41\n\n\ncohort N = 60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAcc.\n\n\nSen.\n\n\nSpec.\n\n\nAcc.\n\n\nSen.\n\n\nSpec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n49-\nGene\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n89\n\n\n91\n\n\n72\n\n\n67\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-gene\n\n\n73\n\n\n50\n\n\n91\n\n\n63\n\n\n67\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-\ngene\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n72\n\n\n87\n\n\n63\n\n\n59\n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMichigan\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncohort N =\n\n\nHarvard cohort\n\n\nDuke cohort N =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\nN = 84\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAcc.\n\n\nSen.\n\n\nSpec.\n\n\nAcc.\n\n\nSen.\n\n\nSpec.\n\n\nAcc.\n\n\nSen.\n\n\nSpec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n49-\n\n\n69\n\n\n67\n\n\n69\n\n\n71\n\n\n71\n\n\n72\n\n\n82\n\n\n93\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-\n\n\n81\n\n\n58\n\n\n90\n\n\n60\n\n\n60\n\n\n58\n\n\n74\n\n\n80\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-\n\n\n81\n\n\n75\n\n\n84\n\n\n58\n\n\n63\n\n\n53\n\n\n76\n\n\n80\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: The 49-gene model was tested for prognostic predictive accuracy by leave-one-out cross-validation.

By changing the labeling criteria to: bad prognosis = death <30 months, good prognosis = alive >15 months (in both cohorts of patients), we obtained what is defined here as the “modified reduced datasets” These datasets, which included more patients than the “reduced datasets” (as defined in the methods section above), were subjected to meta-analysis, with a dual strategy identical to that described for the “reduced datasets” above. This led to the identification of a 71-gene prognostic signature (which shares 23 genes with the 49-gene signature). The performance of the 71-gene model in the leave-one-out cross-validation is shown here, in comparison to the 49-gene model and to the 50-and 100-gene models from Beer et al. (as above), for the modified reduced datasets, the reduced datasets, and the original datasets. As shown, the 71-gene model did not perform better than the 49-gene model, despite containing 22 additional genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, the performance of the 49-gene model was tested by Kaplan-Meier analysis on stage I adenocarcinomas (\nFIG. 10\n). The 49-gene model was very effective in predicting overall survival in the stage I patients both from the Michigan and Harvard cohorts (\nFIG. 10\n and \nFIG. 13\n). In addition, when a dataset from a third independent expression profile study [the “Duke cohort”] was tested, the 49-gene model proved remarkably effective in predicting prognosis (Table 5, and table 6), and overall survival (\nFIG. 10\n, and \nFIG. 13\n). It is of note that the 49-gene model performed better that the 50- and 100-gene models (Beer et al) both in the prediction of prognosis (Table 5) and of overall survival (\nFIG. 13B\n), when tested on the Duke cohort, which might be considered as a validation cohort for the three models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis in Lung Adenocarcinoma of an In Vitro Derived Transcriptional Signature\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have previously shown that a biased approach to cancer transcriptomes can lead to the identification of cancer signatures. In particular, a 28-gene biased signature was identified by profiling terminally differentiated myotubes forced to re-entry the cell cycle by the viral oncoprotein E1A. The expression of genes from this signature was frequently found to be altered in human neoplasia (Nicassio, F., et al, 2005\n, J Chin Invest \n115:3015-3025). Thus, we investigated whether the expression of these genes had predictive value in patient with stage I lung adenocarcinomas. We employed the data set from the Duke cohort, since it was the only one for which the expression data for all 28 of our genes was available. The 28 genes are identified in table 8 as having source “E1A” and are shown separately in table 8a.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 11A\n, the biased signature could effectively predict overall survival, further confirming that a biased approach can lead to the discovery of cancer-relevant signatures (see also table 7, below).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferential expression of genes of the 28-gene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbiased signature in Stage I lung adenocarcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFOLD RATIO\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol/Gene\n\n\nProbe set\n\n\ntumor/normal\n\n\np-value\n\n\nAcc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASP\n\n\nm97856_at\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n0.0105\n\n\nAY700118\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRM2\n\n\nx59618_at\n\n\n4.93\n\n\n0.0032\n\n\nAK123010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE2F1\n\n\ns49592_s_at\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\nBC050369\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM4\n\n\nx74794_at\n\n\n2.11\n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\nNM_005914\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASP\n\n\n33255_at\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n0.0412\n\n\nAY700118\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG3BP2\n\n\n35793_at\n\n\n1.20\n\n\n0.0185\n\n\nNM_203505\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSF3BP1\n\n\n39444_at\n\n\n2.02\n\n\n0.0097\n\n\nNM_012433\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM4\n\n\n981_at\n\n\n3.96\n\n\n0.0003\n\n\nNM_005914\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCNE2\n\n\n35249_at\n\n\n3.87\n\n\n0.0002\n\n\nNM_057749\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRM2\n\n\n36922_at\n\n\n4.17\n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\nAK123010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM6\n\n\n40117_at\n\n\n1.89\n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\nNM_005915\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFOLD RATIO\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol/Gene\n\n\nProbe set\n\n\nbad/good\n\n\np-value\n\n\nAcc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM6\n\n\n40117_at\n\n\n1.44\n\n\n0.0011\n\n\nNM_005915\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM7\n\n\n947_at\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n0.0080\n\n\nNM_182776\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuke study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSP37/KIAA1594\n\n\n226729_at\n\n\n1.72\n\n\n0.0012\n\n\nBX538024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRM2\n\n\n201890_at\n\n\n2.13\n\n\n0.0028\n\n\nAK123010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLJ37562\n\n\n1553108_at\n\n\n1.97\n\n\n0.0032\n\n\nBC053677\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM7\n\n\n210983_s_at\n\n\n1.93\n\n\n0.0071\n\n\nNM_182776\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM4\n\n\n222036_s_at\n\n\n2.63\n\n\n0.0076\n\n\nNM_005914\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG3BP2\n\n\n208841_s_at\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n0.0160\n\n\nNM_203505\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSF3B1\n\n\n201071_x_at\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n0.0172\n\n\nNM_012433\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAM91A1/FLJ23790/SKIN\n\n\n226294_x_at\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n0.0187\n\n\nAL832999\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUHRF1\n\n\n225655_at\n\n\n1.95\n\n\n0.0216\n\n\nAB177623\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAT1\n\n\n203138_at\n\n\n1.79\n\n\n0.0227\n\n\nAK127840\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRPC4AP\n\n\n212059_s_at\n\n\n1.25\n\n\n0.0277\n\n\nAL096738\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC3orf4\n\n\n239146_at\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n0.0351\n\n\nBX647535\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSYNCRIP/NSAP1\n\n\n217832_at\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n0.0352\n\n\nAB209098\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCKAP5/Ch-TOG\n\n\n1555278_a_at\n\n\n1.44\n\n\n0.0374\n\n\nNM_001008938\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCC-112/KIAA0648\n\n\n212138_at\n\n\n1.28\n\n\n0.0428\n\n\nBC114218\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: These data are supplemental to those shown in FIG. 11A. Since datasets from the Michigan, Harvard and Duke studies were obtained on different generations of chips, not all of the 28 genes of the biased signature were present on the chips. In particular, only 5 and 11 genes of 28 were present on the chips used in the Michigan and Harvard studies, respectively. This prevented Kaplan-Meyer analysis on the Michigan and Harvard cohorts, which, on the other hand, could be meaningfully performed on the Duke cohorts, since all the 28 genes were present in the datasets (see FIG. 11A).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, as shown in this Table (top), 4 of 5 genes, and 7 of 11 genes, were significantly overexpressed in tumor vs. normal tissues in the Michigan and Harvard study, respectively (it was not possible to perform the same analysis on the Duke datasets since no information were present as to expression levels in normal lungs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition (bottom part of the Table), in the Harvard cohort, 2 of 11 genes were significantly regulated in the comparison between good and bad prognosis patients. No significant regulation was found in the 5 genes present in the Stage I lung adenocarcinomas in the Michigan cohort, whereas, in the \nDuke cohort\n 15 of 28 genes were significantly regulated in the unfavorable prognosis vs. the good prognosis group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 10-Gene Prognostic Model in Stage I Lung Adenocarcinomas\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next step in our experimental approach was to integrate models derived from unbiased and biased screenings. Thus, we combined the 49-gene model and the 28-gene biased signature. We also added 3 genes (SCGB3A1, TERT, EIF3S6) identified in the literature as individual prognostic markers for stage I lung adenocarcinoma (Buttitta, F. et al, 2005\n, Clin Cancer Res \n11:3198-3204, Wang, L., et al, 2002\n, Clin Cancer Res \n8:2883-2889, Marchetti, A., et al, 2004\n, Clin Cancer Res \n10:1338-1343). This set of 80 genes demonstrated excellent predictive power for overall patient survival in Kaplan-Meyer analysis of the Duke cohort (the only one for which expression data for all 80 genes are available) (\nFIG. 11\n \nb \nand Table 8).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the 80-gene model in the, Michigan, Harvard and Duke cohort and in

Analysis of the 80-gene model in the Michigan, Harvard, Duke cohort and in the IFOM training cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegend to Table 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genes of the 80-gene model are shown with their human gene symbol, name, human accession number and source (Liter., from literature; E1A, from the 28-gene biased signature; Meta., from meta-analysis of the reduced Michigan and Harvard datasets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8a simply separates out the genes having an E1A source;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8b simply separates out the genes having a meta-analysis source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis in the Michigan, Harvard and Duke cohorts was performed on the available microarray datasets by selecting stage I NSCLC (67, 62 and 34 patients, respectively); in the IFOM training cohort, the analysis was performed by Real Time PCR (Q-PCR, see above for details). Fold ratio indicates the average fold mRNA increase (>1.0) or decrease (<1.0) in the bad prognosis group, compared to the good prognosis group (followed by its p-value). Asterisks indicate the 16 genes selected to develop the final prognostic model. ND, not detectable. NO, No probeset corresponding to the hypothetical U60269 gene was present on the HU133 2.0 plus chip used in the Duke analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe column ‘TREND’ indicates the assigned regulation trend of each gene transcript in the poor prognosis group compared to the good prognosis group, based on the dominant trend, and is intended to provide an indication as to how these genes may be associated with worsening of prognosis. All the 28 E1A genes are considered to be up regulated in the poor prognosis class, based on the results of our previous E1A screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe major goal of our efforts was to identify a small number of genes, amenable to analysis with a readily available technology (such as Real Time PCR), which can constitute a prognostic model that can be rapidly transferred to the clinical laboratory. Thus, we used TaqMan® Low Density Arrays to profile a set of 25 patients with stage I lung adenocarcinomas (henceforth “the IFOM training cohort”, see Methods). At the time of our analysis, TaqMan® Low Density Arrays were available for 53 of the 80 genes (see Table 8). The profiling results obtained using the IFOM training cohortare summarized in Table 8. From these results, we excluded a number of genes that did not show variability between the good and bad prognosis groups, and we then selected 16 genes for further analysis (p≦0.05 or fold change greater than ±1.5 range, as cutoff, Table 8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final prognostic model was obtained by the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, with independent gene selection (p<0.05 as cutoff; parametric t-test). We found that a 10-gene model displayed a predictive accuracy of 84% (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 80%) and a p-value of 0.004, after 2000 random permutations of class labels (Table 9).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFOLD\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n\n\nGene\n\n\nAcc\n\n\nt-value\n\n\nRATIO\n\n\np-value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUDCD1\n\n\nCML66\n\n\nBC043406\n\n\n−3.95\n\n\n1.80\n\n\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE2F1\n\n\nE2F1\n\n\nBC050369\n\n\n−2.63\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOXB7\n\n\nHOXB7\n\n\nAK223249\n\n\n−2.59\n\n\n2.53\n\n\n0.017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCM6\n\n\nMCM6\n\n\nNM_005915\n\n\n−2.57\n\n\n1.80\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSERPINB5\n\n\nSERPINB5\n\n\nBX640597\n\n\n−2.53\n\n\n3.95\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE2F4\n\n\nE2F4\n\n\nNM_001950\n\n\n−2.51\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHSPG2\n\n\nHSPG2\n\n\nM85289\n\n\n−2.38\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n0.026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSF3B1\n\n\nSF3B1\n\n\nNM_012433\n\n\n−2.32\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n0.029\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRM2\n\n\nRRM2\n\n\nAK123010\n\n\n−2.16\n\n\n2.56\n\n\n0.041\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCGB3A1\n\n\nSCGB3A1\n\n\nBM921624\n\n\n5.54\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 9: Final prognostic model obtained by the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure of the IFOM training cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genes of the 10-gene model are shown with their human gene symbol, name and accession number and sorted by the t-values derived from the parametric t-test.

The 10-gene model was tested for prediction of survival in the indicated cohorts of patients, in comparison to other biological or biochemical parameters, in univariate and multivariate analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData are expressed as odds ratio (OD) at 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Asterisks indicate statistically significant values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “IFOM mutational analysis cases” include 39 cases from a total of 70 (of the IFOM training and validation cohorts combined) for which mutational analysis of the KRAS gene was available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significant difference in the survival rate of patients stratified according to the 10-gene prognostic model (p=0.008; log-rank test) (\nFIG. 12A\n). It is also of note that, although our 10-gene model included only 4 genes derived from meta-analysis of expression profiles, it showed very good predictive power in Kaplan-Meyer analysis of the Duke cohort, for which expression data for all 10 genes were available (\nFIG. 12A\n; see also \nFIG. 14\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this example, a poor prognosis patient was considered as one having 3 or more genes following the poor prognosis pattern, namely:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nupregulated in the poor prognosis compared to the good prognosis group for all genes except for SCGB3A1;\n \ndownregulated in the poor prognosis group compared to the good prognosis group in the case of SCGB3A1.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nOf course, depending on the purpose, patients could be considered “poor prognosis” having a different number of genes following the poor prognosis pattern. E.g., patients having 2 or more, or 4 or 5 or more genes following the “poor prognosis” pattern could be placed in the poor prognosis class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also tested whether our 10-gene model had predictive power in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. The 5-year survival rate of clinical stage IA lung cancer patients ranges from 67% to 77% (28-30) after surgery alone. Thus, in this group, molecular tools for patient stratification are greatly needed, to select high-risk patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy. As shown in \nFIG. 12B\n, our 10-gene model displayed very good predictive power both in the IFOM and in the Duke (stage IA) cohorts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the inventors measured performance of the 10-genes model compared to the 21-genes set of table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prognostic predictive accuracies of the 10-genes model, the 21-genes model and the 11-genes model (obtained after subtracting the 10 genes of the 10-genes model from the 21-genes set) on the training cohort (25 patients), testing cohort (45 patients) and the entire data set (70 patients, training+testing cohorts) were measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the ‘Training Cohort’ the definition of the classifier was performed by applying diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) and leave-one-out cross-validation. In the ‘Test Cohort’ prediction of prognosis was performed by applying the diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) classification method using the gene expression values of the training cohort to train the classifier. The results are shown below. Remarkably, it can be seen that the reduced, ten gene dataset performs better than the 21 gene dataset despite containing fewer genes.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel\n\n\nAcc.

A., et al, 2002\n, Cancer Res \n62:3005-3008, Beer et al, as above, Lu, Y., et al, 2006\n, PLoS Med \n3:e467, Raponi, M., et al, 2006\n, Cancer Res \n66:7466-7472, Endoh, H., et al, 2004\n, J Clin Oncol \n22:811-819) consisted in merging a biased signature with those obtained by the unbiased analysis of microarray expression profiles. A biased approach to cancer transcriptomes relies on the assumption that a limited number of altered signaling pathways lead to the malignant state. Thus, molecular tools that cause transformation of cells in vitro might be used to circumvent the problems connected with unbiased transcriptome analysis, such as high individual genetic noise. We validated such an approach by showing that a signature, obtained in myotubes forced to re-enter the cell cycle by the E1A oncogene, contained genes overexpressed in human tumors that could predict unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer. We show in example 5 that the same biased signature can, by itself, predict clinical outcome in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinomas. It is of note that the genes of the 28-gene biased signature did not emerge from the analysis of lung cancer microarray datasets, either in this study or in other studies (Wigle, D. A., et al, 2002\n, Cancer Res \n62:3005-3008, Beer, D. G., et al, 2002\n, Nat Med \n8:816-824, Lu, Y., et al, 2006\n, PLoS Med \n3:e467, Raponi, M., et al, 2006\n, Cancer Res \n66:7466-7472, Endoh, H., et al, 2004\n, J Clin Oncol \n22:811-819, Jiang, H., et al, 2004\n, BMC Bioinformatics \n5:81, Chen, H. Y., et al, 2007\n, N Engl J Med \n356:11-20) [the only exception is SYNCRIP, reported in a recent study (Potti, A., \nN Engl J Med \n355:570-580)], thus confirming the power of the biased approach in revealing gene expression programs not otherwise easily identifiable. Finally, the composition of the final 10-gene prognostic model confirmed the hypothesized efficacy of our integrated approach, as it consisted of 5 genes derived from the E1A signature (NUDCD1, E2F1, MCM6, RRM2 and SF3B1), 4 genes from the metanalysis of microarray data (HOXB7, SERPINB5, E2F4 and HSPG2), and 1 gene (SCGB3A1) from the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe references mentioned herein are all expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety."

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to methods for inducing and/or enhancing immune responses to tumor antigens.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing immunological approaches to cancer therapy has been difficult as tumor cells are self-derived and therefore not as immunogenic as exogenous agents such as bacteria and viruses. As a result, the prospects of cancer immunotherapy rely upon the identification of tumor associated antigens (“TAA”) which can be recognized by the immune system. Specifically, target antigens eliciting T cell-mediated responses are of critical interest. This comes from evidence that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can induce tumor regression both in animal models (Kast W. et al (1989) \nCell \n59:6035; Greendberg P. (1991) \nAdv. Immunol. \n49:281) and in humans (Boon T. et al. (1994) \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n12:337). To date, many tumor associated antigens have been identified. These include the antigens MAGE, BAGE, GAGE, RAGE, gp100, MART-1/Melan-A, tyrosinase, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as well as many others (Honig and Kaufman (1999) \nClinical Immunology \n92:211-223). Some of these tumor associated antigens are discussed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first human tumor associated antigen characterized was identified from a melanoma. This antigen (originally designated MAGE 1) was identified using CTLs isolated from an HLA A1+ melanoma patient to screen HLA A1 target cells transfected with tumor DNA (van der Bruggen P. (1991) \nScience, \n254:1643; these tumor associated antigens are now designated MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2, etc). Interestingly, \nMAGE\n 1 was found to belong to a family of at least 12 closely related genes located on the X chromosome (de Plaen, E. et al. (1994) \nImmunogenetics \n40:360). The nucleic acid sequence of the 11 additional MAGE genes share 65-85% identity with that of MAGE-1 (de Smet, C. et al. (1994) \nImmunogenetics \n39:121). Both \n \nMAGE\n \n 1 and 3 are present in normal tissues, but expressed only in the testis (de Plaen, E. et al. (1994) Supra; de Smet, C. et al. (1994) Supra; Takahashi, K et al. (1995) \nCancer Res. \n55:3478; Chyomey, P. et al. (1995) \nImmunogenetics \n43:97). These initial results have subsequently been extended with the identification of new gene families (i.e. RAGE, BAGE, GAGE), all of which are typically not expressed in normal tissues (except testis) but expressed in a variety of tumor types.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a 180 kD glycoprotein expressed on the majority of colon, rectal, stomach and pancreatic tumors (Muaro et al. (1985) \nCancer Res. \n45:5769), some 50% of breast carcinomas (Steward et al. (1974) \nCancer \n33:1246) and 70% of lung carcinomas (Vincent, R. G. and Chu, T. M. (1978) \nJ. Thor. Cardiovas. Surg. \n66:320). CEA was first described as a cancer specific fetal antigen in adenocarcinoma of the human digestive tract in 1965 (Gold, P. and Freeman, S. O. (1965) \nExp. Med. \n121:439). Since that time, CEA has been characterized as a cell surface antigen produced in excess in nearly all solid tumors of the human gastrointestinal tract. The gene for the human CEA protein has been cloned (Oikawa et al (1987) \nBiochim. Biophys. Res. \n142:511-518; European Application No. EP 0346710). CEA is also expressed in fetal gut tissue and to a lesser extent on normal colon epithelium. The immunogenicity of CEA has been ambiguous, with several studies reporting the presence of anti-CEA antibodies in patients (Gold et al. (1973) \nNature New Biology \n239:60; Pompecki, R. (1980) \nEur. J. Cancer \n16:973; Ura et al. (1985) \nCancer Lett. \n25:283; Fuchs et al. (1988) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n26:180) while other studies have not (LoGerfo et al. (1972) \nInt. J. Cancer \n9:344; MacSween, J. M. (1975) \nInt. J. Cancer \n15:246; Chester K. A. and Begent, H. J. (1984) \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n58:685).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGp100 is normally found in melanosomes and expressed in melanocytes, retinal cells, and other neural crest derivatives. The function of gp100 is currently unknown. By mass spectrometry, three immunodominant HLA-A2 binding gp100 epitopes have been identified: 89-154 (amino acids 154-162), g9-209 (amino acids 209-217); and g9-280 (amino acids 280-288). Notably, two of these epitopes (as peptides) have been synthetically altered so as to induce a more vigorous immune response in the original T cell clone: the threonine at \nposition\n 2 in gp-209 was changed to a methionine, and the alanine residue at position 9 in gp-280 was changed to a valine. These changes increase the binding affinity of the epitope-peptides to the HLA-A2 molecule without changing the intrinsic natural epitopes recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR). Rosenberg and colleagues (NIH) have already successfully immunized melanoma patients with one of these modified peptides and have reported achieving objective clinical responses in some patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite significant advances that have been made with respect to immunological approaches to cancer treatment, there is still a need in the art to improve cancer immunotherapies.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to improved methods for inducing and/or enhancing an immune response to a tumor antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have found that administering the tumor antigen or nucleic acid coding therefor directly into a lymphatic site (such as a lymph node) induces and/or significantly enhances the immune response to the tumor antigen and/or breaks tolerance to the tumor antigen, both which have been a major challenge in previous methods of cancer immunotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, one aspect the present invention provides a method for inducing and/or enhancing an immune response in an animal to a tumor antigen comprising administering an effective amount of a tumor antigen, nucleic acid coding therefor, vector or cell comprising said nucleic acid, or vaccine comprising the aforementioned to a lymphatic site in the animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method for breaking immune tolerance to a tumor antigen in an animal comprising administering an effective amount of a tumor antigen, nucleic acid coding therefor, vector or cell comprising said nucleic acid, or vaccine comprising the aforementioned to a lymphatic site in the animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description.

Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for inducing and/or enhancing an immune response in an animal to a tumor antigen comprising administering an effective amount of a tumor antigen, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a tumor antigen, a vector or cell comprising the nucleic acid sequence, or a vaccine comprising the tumor antigen, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the tumor antigen, or a vector comprising the nucleic acid sequence encoding the tumor antigen to a lymphatic site in the animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “inducing and/or enhancing an immune response” means that the method evokes and/or enhances any response of the animal's immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Immune response” is defined as any response of the immune system, for example, of either a cell-mediated (i.e. cytotoxic T-lymphocyte mediated) or humoral (i.e. antibody mediated) nature. These immune responses can be assessed by a number of in vivo or in vitro assays well known to one skilled in the art including, but not limited to, antibody assays (for example ELISA assays) antigen specific cytotoxicity assays, production of cytokines (for example ELISPOT assays), regression of tumors expressing the tumor antigens, inhibition of cancer cells expressing the tumor antigens, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “lymphatic site” means a site in the body that is associated with the lymphatic system including lymphatic organs, tissues, cells, nodes or glands such as spleen, thymus, tonsils, Peyer's patches, bone marrow, lymphocytes, thoracic duct as well as all of the lymph nodes of the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “animal” as used herein includes all members of the animal kingdom and is preferably human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective amount” as used herein means an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired results.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “tumor antigen” as used herein includes both tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor specific antigens (TSAs). A tumor associated antigen means an antigen that is expressed on the surface of a tumor cell in higher amounts than is observed on normal cells or an antigen that is expressed on normal cells during fetal development. A tumor specific antigen is an antigen that is unique to tumor cells and is not expressed on normal cells. The term tumor antigen includes TMs or TSAs that have been already identified and those that have yet to be identified and includes fragments, epitopes and any and all modifications to the tumor antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tumor associated antigen can be any tumor associated antigen including, but not limited to, gp100 (Kawakami et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n154:3961-3968 (1995); Cox et al., \nScience, \n264:716-719 (1994)), MART-1/Melan A (Kawakami et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n180:347-352 (1994); Castelli et al., \nJ. Exp.

In particular, the inventors have prepared a modified gp100 peptide termed gp100M which has the nucleic acid sequence shown in \nFIG. 6\n (SEQ. ID. NO.:109) and the deduced amino acid sequence shown in \nFIG. 7\n (SEQ. ID. NO.:110). The inventors have shown that the intranodal injection of a recombinant avipox virus comprising a nucleic acid coding for fragments of the modified gp100 (comprising modified epitopes 209(2M) (IMDQVPFSY, SEQ. ID. NO.:1) and 290(9V) (YLEPGPVTV, SEQ. ID. NO.:2)) followed by modified epitope/peptide boosts induced both a humoral and cell mediated response that was several times higher than when the same antigens were administered subcutaneously. The experimental details and results are discussed in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the tumor-associated antigen is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a modified CEA or a fragment thereof. The nucleic acid sequence of a modified CEA antigen is shown in \nFIG. 8\n and SEQ. ID. NO.:111. The corresponding amino acid sequence is shown in \nFIG. 8\n and SEQ. ID. NO.:112. Preferably, the modified CEA antigen comprises the sequence YLSGADLNL, SEQ. ID. NO.:113.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional embodiments of the invention encompass nucleic acid sequences comprising sequences encoding the tumor antigens and fragments or modified forms thereof as hereinbefore described. The term “nucleic acid sequence” refers to a sequence of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The term also includes modified or substituted sequences comprising non-naturally occurring monomers or portions thereof, which function similarly. The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be ribonucleic (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) and may contain naturally occurring bases including adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymidine and uracil. The sequences may also contain modified bases such as xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl, 2-propyl, and other alkyl adenines, 5-halo uracil, 5-halo cytosine, 6-aza uracil, 6-aza cytosine and 6-aza thymine, pseudo uracil, 4-thiouracil, 8-halo adenine, 8-amino adenine, 8-thiol adenine, 8-thio-alkyl adenines, 8-hydroxyl adenine and other 8-substituted adenines, 8-halo guanines, 8-amino guanine, 8-thiol guanine, 8-thioalkyl guanines, 8-hydroxyl guanine and other 8-substituted guanines, other aza and deaza uracils, thymidines, cytosines, adenines, or guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl uracil and 5-trifluoro cytosine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid sequences encoding the tumor antigens of the invention include, but are not limited to, viral nucleic acid(s), plasmid(s), bacterial DNA, naked/free DNA and RNA. The nucleic acids encompass both single and double stranded forms. As such, these nucleic acids comprise the relevant base sequences coding for the aforementioned tumor antigens. For purposes of definitiveness, the “relevant base sequences coding for the aforementioned polypeptides” further encompass complementary nucleic acid sequences. As such, embodiments of the invention encompass nucleic acid sequences per se encoding for the aforementioned tumor antigens, or recombinant nucleic acids into which has been inserted said nucleic acids coding for tumor antigens (as described below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacterial DNA useful in recombinant nucleic acid embodiments of the invention are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Sources of bacterial DNA include, for example, Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, Lactobacillus, Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG), and Streptococcus. In bacterial DNA embodiments of the invention, nucleic acid of the invention may be inserted into the bacterial genome, can remain in a free state, or be carried on a plasmid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViral recombinant nucleic acid embodiments of the invention may be derived from a poxvirus or other virus such as adenovirus or alphavirus. Preferably the viral nucleic acid is incapable of integration in recipient animal cells. The elements for expression from said nucleic acid may include a promoter suitable for expression in recipient animal cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific vial recombinant nucleic acid embodiments of the invention encompass (but are not limited to) poxviral, alphaviral, and adenoviral nucleic acid. Poxviral nucleic acid may be selected from the group consisting of avipox, orthopox, and suipox nucleic acid. Particular embodiments encompass poxviral nucleic acid selected from vaccinia, fowlpox, canary pox and swinepox; specific examples include TROVAC, NYVAC, ALVAC, MVA, Wyeth and Poxvac-TC (described in more detail below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further contemplated that recombinant nucleic acids of this invention may further comprise nucleic acid sequences encoding at least one member chosen from the group consisting of cytokines, lymphokines, and co-stimulatory molecules. Examples include (but are not limited to) \ninterleukin\n 2, interleukin 12, \ninterleukin\n 6, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor Alpha, GM-CSF, B7.1, B7.2, ICAM-1, LFA-3, and Cd72.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard techniques of molecular biology for preparing and purifying nucleic acids well known to those skilled in the art can be used in the preparation of the recombinant nucleic acid aspects of the invention (for example, as taught in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, F. M. Ausubel et al. (Eds.), John Wiley and Sons, Inc, N.Y., U.S.A. (1998), Chpts. 1, 2 and 4; \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(2\nnd \n \nEd\n.), J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis (Eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, N.Y., U.S.A. (1989), Chpts. 1, 2, 3 and 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAspects of this invention further encompass vectors comprising the aforementioned nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, said vectors may be recombinant viruses or bacteria (as described below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenovirus vectors and methods for their construction have been described (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,994,132, 5,932,210, 6,057,158 and Published PCT Applications WO 9817783, WO 9744475, WO 9961034, WO 9950292, WO 9927101, WO 9720575, WO 9640955, WO 9630534-all of which are herein incorporated by reference). Alphavirus vectors have also been described in the art and can be used in embodiments of this invention (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,792,462, 5,739,026, 5,843,723, 5,789,245, and Published PCT Applications WO 9210578, WO 9527044, WO 9531565, WO 9815636-all of which are herein incorporated by reference), as have lentivirus vectors (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,516, 5,994,136 and Published PCT Applications WO 9817816, WO 9712622, WO 9817815, WO 9839463, WO 9846083, WO 9915641, WO 9919501, WO 9930742, WO 9931251, WO 9851810, WO 0000600—all of which are herein incorporated by reference). Poxvirus vectors that can be used include, for example, avipox, orthopox or suipox poxvirus (as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,773, 4,603,112, 5,762,938, 5,378,457, 5,494,807, 5,505,941, 5,756,103, 5,833,975 and 5,990,091—all of which are herein incorporated by reference). Poxvirus vectors comprising a nucleic acid coding for a tumor antigen can be obtained by homologous recombination as is known to one skilled in the art. As such, the nucleic acid coding for the tumor antigen is inserted into the viral genome under appropriate conditions for expression in mammalian cells (as described below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention the poxvirus vector is ALVAC (1) or ALVAC (2) (both of which have been derived from canarypox virus). ALVAC (1) (or ALVAC (2)) does not productively replicate in non-avian hosts, a characteristic thought to improve its safety profile. ALVAC (1) is an attenuated canarypox virus-based vector that was a plaque-cloned derivative of the licensed canarypox vaccine, Kanapox (Tartaglia et al. (1992) \nVirology \n188:217; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,505,941, 5756103 and 5833975—all of which are incorporated herein by reference). ALVAC (1) has some general properties which are the same as some general properties of Kanapox. ALVAC-based recombinant viruses expressing extrinsic immunogens have also been demonstrated efficacious as vaccine vectors (Tartaglia et al, In AIDS Research Reviews (vol. 3) Koff W., Wong-Staol F. and Kenedy R. C. (eds.), Marcel Dekker NY, pp. 361-378 (1993a); Tartaglia, J. et al. (1993b) \nJ. Virol. \n67:2370). For instance, mice immunized with an ALVAC (1) recombinant expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein were protected from lethal challenge with rabies virus (Tartaglia, J. et al., (1992) supra) demonstrating the potential for ALVAC (1) as a vaccine vector. ALVAC-based recombinants have also proven efficacious in dogs challenged with canine distemper virus (Taylor, J. et al. (1992) \nVirology \n187:321) and rabies virus (Perkus, M. E. et al., In Combined Vaccines and Simultaneous Administration: Current Issues and Perspective, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (1994)), in cats challenged with feline leukemia virus (Tartaglia, J. et al., (1993b) supra), and in horses challenged with equine influenza virus (Taylor, J. et al., In Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Avian Influenza, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wis., pp. 331-335 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nALVAC (2) is a second-generation ALVAC vector in which vaccinia transcription elements E3L and K3L have been inserted within the C6 locus (U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,091, incorporated herein by reference). The E3L encodes a protein capable of specifically binding to dsRNA. The K3L ORF has significant homology to E1F-2. Within ALVAC (2) the E3L gene is under the transcriptional control of its natural promoter, whereas K3L has been placed under the control of the early/late vaccine H6 promoter. The E3L and K3L genes act to inhibit PKR activity in cells infected with ALVAC (II), allowing enhancement of the level and persistence of foreign gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional viral vectors encompass natural host-restricted poxviruses. Fowlpox virus (FPV) is the prototypic virus of the Avipox genus of the Poxvirus family. Replication of avipox viruses is limited to avian species (Matthews, R. E. F. (1982) \nIntervirology \n17:42) and there are no reports in the literature of avipox virus causing a productive infection in any non-avian species including man. This host restriction provides an inherent safety barrier to transmission of the virus to other species and makes use of avipox virus based vectors in veterinary and human applications an attractive proposition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFPV has been used advantageously as a vector expressing immunogens from poultry pathogens. The hemagglutinin protein of a virulent avian influenza virus was expressed in an FPV recombinant. After inoculation of the recombinant into chickens and turkeys, an immune response was induced which was protective against either a homologous or a heterologous virulent influenza virus challenge (Taylor, J. et al. (1988) \nVaccine \n6: 504). FPV recombinants expressing the surface glycoproteins of Newcastle Disease Virus have also been developed (Taylor, J. et al. (1990) \nJ. Virol. \n64:1441; Edbauer, C. et al. (1990) Virology 179:901; U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,599—incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA highly attenuated strain of vaccinia, designated MVA, has also been used as a vector for poxvirus-based vaccines. Use of MVA is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,146.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther attenuated poxvirus vectors have been prepared via genetic modification to wild type strains of vaccinia. The NYVAC vector, for example, is derived by deletion of specific virulence and host-range genes from the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia (Tartaglia, J. et al. (1992), supra; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,773 and 5,494,807—incorporated herein by reference) and has proven useful as a recombinant vector in eliciting a protective immune response against expressed foreign antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant viruses can be constructed by processes known to those skilled in the art (for example, as previously described for vaccinia and avipox viruses; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,769,330; 4,722,848; 4,603,112; 5,110,587; and 5174993-all of which are incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments of the invention, live and/or attenuated bacteria may also be used as vectors. For example, non-toxicogenic \nVibrio cholerae \nmutant strains may be useful as bacterial vectors in embodiments of this invention; as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,278 (disclosing a strain in which a substantial amount of the coding sequence of each of the two ctxA alleles has been deleted so that no functional cholera toxin is produced), WO 92/11354 (strain in which the irgA locus is inactivated by mutation; this mutation can be combined in a single strain with ctxA mutations), and WO 94/1533 (deletion mutant lacking functional ctxA and attRS1 DNA sequences). These strains can be genetically engineered to express heterologous antigens, as described in WO 94/19482. (All of the aforementioned issued patent/patent applications are incorporated herein by reference.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttenuated \nSalmonella typhimurium \nstrains, genetically engineered for recombinant expression of heterologous antigens and their use as oral immunogens are described, for example, in WO 92/11361.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that other bacterial strains useful as bacterial vectors in embodiments of this invention include (but are not limited to) \nShigella flexneri, Streptococcus gordonii\n, and Bacille Calmette Guerin (as described in WO 88/6626, WO 90/0594, WO 91/13157, WO 92/1796, and WO 92/21376; all of which are incorporated herein by reference). In bacterial vector embodiments of this invention, a nucleic acid coding for a tumor antigen may be inserted into the bacterial genome, can remain in a free state, or be carried on a plasmid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further contemplated that the invention encompasses vectors which comprise nucleic acids coding for at least one member from the group consisting of cytokines, lymphokines and immunostimulatory molecules. Said nucleic acid sequences can be contiguous with sequences coding for the tumor antigen or encoded on distinct nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells comprising the aforementioned tumor antigens, nucleic acids coding therefor, and/or vectors encompass further embodiments of the invention. These cells encompass any potential cell into which the aforementioned tumor antigen, nucleic acid, and/or vector might be introduced and/or transfected and/or infected (for example, bacteria, COS cells, Vero cells, chick embryo fibroblasts, tumor cells, antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, etc.). The choice of process for the introduction and/or transfection and/or infection into cells is dependant upon the intrinsic nature of the introduced agent (i.e. free DNA, plasmid, recombinant virus), as will be known to one skilled in the art (for example, as taught in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, F. M. Ausubel et al. (Eds.), John Wiley and Sons, Inc., N.Y., U.S.A. (1998), Chpt. 9; \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(2nd Ed.), J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis (Eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, N.Y., U.S.A. (1989), Chpts. 1, 2, 3 and 16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther embodiments of the invention encompass vaccines comprising the tumor antigens and/or nucleic acids coding therefor and/or vectors and/or cells previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vaccine of the invention comprising the tumor antigen may be a multivalent vaccine and additionally contain several peptides, epitopes or fragments of a particular tumor antigen or contain peptides related to other tumor antigens and/or infectious agents in a prophylactically or therapeutically effective manner. Multivalent vaccines against cancers may contain a number of individual TAA's, or immunogenic fragments thereof, alone or in combinations which are effective to modulate an immune response to cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vaccine of the invention may contain a nucleic acid molecule encoding a tumor antigen of the invention. Such vaccines are referred to as nucleic acid vaccines but are also termed genetic vaccines, polynucleotide vaccines or DNA vaccines, all of which are within the scope of the present invention. In such an embodiment, the tumor antigen is produced in vivo in the host animal. Additional embodiments if the invention encompass vectors (i.e. bacteria, recombinant viruses) comprising the aforementioned nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also contemplates mixtures of the tumor antigens, nucleic acids coding therefor, vectors comprising said nucleic acids, cells and/or vaccines comprising the aforementioned, and at least one member selected from the group consisting of cytokines, lymphokines, immunostimulatory molecules, and nucleic acids coding therefor. Additional embodiments of this invention further encompass pharmaceutical compositions comprising the aforementioned tumor antigens, nucleic acids coding therefor, vectors, cells, vaccines or mixtures for administration to subjects in a biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo. By “biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo” is meant a form of the substance to be administered in which any toxic effects are outweighed by the therapeutic effects. Administration of a therapeutically active amount of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, or an “effective amount”, is defined as an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time, necessary to achieve the desired result of eliciting an immune response in an animal. A therapeutically effective amount of a substance may vary according to factors such as the disease state/health, age, sex, and weight of the recipient, and the inherent ability of the particular tumor antigen, nucleic acid coding therefor, vector, cell, or vaccine to elicit a desired immune response. Dosage regima may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily, or at periodic intervals, and/or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be prepared by per se known methods for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which can be administered to animals such that an effective quantity of the active substance (i.e. tumor antigen, nucleic acid, recombinant virus, vaccine) is combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Suitable vehicles are described, for example, in “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives” (compiled by Michael and Irene Ash, Gower Publishing Limited, Aldershot, England (1995)). On this basis, the compositions include, albeit not exclusively, solutions of the substances in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents, and may be contained in buffered solutions with a suitable pH and/or be iso-osmotic with physiological fluids. In this regard, reference can be made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,456. These compositions may further comprise an adjuvant (as described below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther embodiments of the invention encompass methods of inhibiting a tumor antigen expressing cancer cell in a patient comprising administering to said patient an effective amount of a tumor antigen, nucleic acid coding therefor, vector, cell, or vaccine of the invention. Patients with solid tumors expressing tumor antigens include (but are not limited to) those suffering from colon cancer, lung cancer, pancreas cancer, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma, oral cancer, laryngeal cancer, seminoma, hepatocellular cancer, bile duct cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. As such, methods of treating patients with cancer per se encompassing the aforementioned methods of inducing an immune response and/or inhibiting a tumor antigen expressing cell are contemplated aspects/embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned previously, an animal may be immunized with a tumor antigen, nucleic acid coding therefore, vector, cell or vaccine of the invention by administering the aforementioned to a lymphatic site. The administration can be achieved in a single dose or repeated at intervals. The appropriate dosage is dependant on various parameters understood by the skilled artisans, such as the immunogen itself (i.e. polypeptide vs. nucleic acid (and more specifically type thereof)), the route of administration and the condition of the animal to be vaccinated (weight, age and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously noted, nucleic acids (in particular plasmids and/or free/naked DNA and/or RNA coding for the tumor antigen of the invention) can be administered to an animal for purposes of inducing/eliciting an immune response (for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,466; McDonnell and Askari, \nNEJM \n334:42-45 (1996); Kowalczyk and Ertl, \nCell Mol. Life Sci. \n55:751-770 (1999)). Typically, this nucleic acid is a form that is unable to replicate in the target animal's cell and unable to integrate in said animal's genome. The DNA/RNA molecule encoding the tumor antigen is also typically placed under the control of a promoter suitable for expression in the animal's cell. The promoter can function ubiquitously or tissue-specifically. Examples of non-tissue specific promoters include the early Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,062) and the Rous Sarcoma Virus promoter. The desmin promoter is tissue-specific and drives expression in muscle cells. More generally, useful vectors have been described (i.e., WO 94/21797).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration of nucleic acids coding for a tumor antigen, said nucleic acid can encode a precursor or mature form of the polypeptide/protein. When it encodes a precursor form, the precursor form can be homologous or heterologous. In the latter case, a eucaryotic leader sequence can be used, such as the leader sequence of the tissue-type plasminogen factor (tPA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use as an immunogen, a nucleic acid of the invention can be formulated according to various methods known to a skilled artisan. First, a nucleic acid can be used in a naked/free form, free of any delivery vehicles (such as anionic liposomes, cationic lipids, microparticles, (e.g., gold microparticles), precipitating agents (e.g., calcium phosphate) or any other transfection-facilitating agent. In this case the nucleic acid can be simply diluted in a physiologically acceptable solution (such as sterile saline or sterile buffered saline) with or without a carrier. When present, the carrier preferably is isotonic, hypotonic, or weakly hypertonic, and has a relatively low ionic strength (such as provided by a sucrose solution (e.g., a solution containing 20% sucrose)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a nucleic acid can be associated with agents that assist in cellular uptake. It can be, i.e., (i) complemented with a chemical agent that modifies the cellular permeability (such as bupivacaine; see, for example, WO 94/16737), (ii) encapsulated into liposomes, or (iii) associated with cationic lipids or silica, gold, or tungsten microparticles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCationic, lipids are well known in the art and are commonly used for gene delivery. Such lipids include Lipofectin (also known as DOTMA (N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride), DOTAP (1,2-bis(oleyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio) propane). DDAB (dimethyldioctadecyl-ammonium bromide), DOGS (dioctadecylamidologlycyl spermine) and cholesterol derivatives such as DC-Chol (3 beta-(N—(N′,N′-dimethyl aminomethane)-carbamoyl) cholesterol). A description of these cationic lipids can be found in EP 187702, WO 90/11092, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,185, WO 91/15501, WO 95/26356, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,928. Cationic lipids for gene delivery are preferably used in association with a neutral lipid such as DOPE (dioleyl phosphatidylethanolamine) as, for example, described in WO 90/11092.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther transfection-facilitating compounds can be added to a formulation containing cationic liposomes. A number of them are described in, for example, WO 93/18759, WO 93/19768, WO 94/25608, and WO 95/2397. They include, for example, spermine derivatives useful for facilitating the transport of DNA through the nuclear membrane (see, for example, WO 93/18759) and membrane-permeabilizing compounds such as GALA, Gramicidine S, and cationic bile salts (see, for example, WO 93/19768).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGold or tungsten microparticles can also be used for nucleic acid delivery (as described in WO 91/359 and WO 93/17706). In this case, the microparticle-coated polynucleotides can be injected via intradermal or intraepidermal routes using a needleless injection device (“gene gun”; such as those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,050, U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,580, and WO 94/24263).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnionic and neutral liposomes are also well-known in the art (see, for example, Liposomes: A Practical Approach, RPC New Ed, IRL Press (1990), for a detailed description of methods for making liposomes) and are useful for delivering a large range of products, including nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of the aforementioned methods (i.e. to induce/elicit immune responses) encompass prime-boost protocols for the administration of immunogens of the invention. More specifically, these protocols encompass (but are not limited to) a “priming” step with a particular/distinct form of immunogen (i.e. nucleic acid (for example, plasmid, bacterial/viral/free or naked)) coding for tumor antigen, or vector (i.e. recombinant virus, bacteria) comprising said nucleic acid) followed by at least one “boosting” step encompassing the administration of an alternate (i.e. distinct from that used to “prime”) form of the tumor antigen (i.e. protein or fragment thereof (for example, epitope/peptide), nucleic acid coding for the tumor antigen (or fragment thereof), or vector comprising said nucleic acid). Examples of “prime-boost” methodologies are known to those skilled in the art (as taught, for example, in PCT published applications WO 98/58956, WO 98/56919, WO 97/39771). One advantage of said protocols is the potential to circumvent the problem of generating neutralizing immune responses to vectors per se (i.e. recombinant viruses) wherein is inserted/incorporated nucleic acids encoding the immunogen or fragments thereof (see for example, R. M. Conry et al. (2000) \nClin. Cancer Res. \n6:34-41).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, the ability of an immunogen to induce/elicit an immune response can be improved if, regardless of administration formulation (i.e. recombinant virus, nucleic acid, polypeptide), said immunogen is co-administered with an adjuvant. Adjuvants are described and discussed in “Vaccine Design—the Subunit and Adjuvant Approach” (edited by Powell and Newman, Plenum Press, New York, U.S.A., pp. 61-9 and 141-228 (1995)). Adjuvants typically enhance the immunogenicity of an immunogen but are not necessarily immunogenic in and of themselves. Adjuvants may act by retaining the immunogen locally near the site of administration to produce a depot effect facilitating a slow, sustained release of immunizing agent to cells of the immune system. Adjuvants can also attract cells of the immune system to an immunogen depot and stimulate such cells to elicit immune responses. As such, embodiments of this invention encompass compositions further comprising adjuvants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesirable characteristics of ideal adjuvants include:\n\n \n \n \n1) lack of toxicity;\n \n2) ability to stimulate a long-lasting immune response;\n \n3) simplicity of manufacture and stability in long-term storage;\n \n4) ability to elicit both cellular and humoral responses to antigens administered by various routes, if required;\n \n5) synergy with other adjuvants;\n \n6) capability of selectively interacting with populations of antigen presenting cells (APC);\n \n7) ability to specifically elicit appropriate TH1 or TH2 cell-specific immune responses; and\n \n8) ability to selectively increase appropriate antibody isotype levels (for example, IgA) against antigens/immunogens.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nHowever, many adjuvants are toxic and can cause undesirable side effects, thus making them unsuitable for use in humans and many animals. For example, some adjuvants may induce granulomas, acute and chronic inflammations (i.e. Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)), cytolysis (i.e. saponins and pluronic polymers) and pyrogenicity, arthritis and anterior uveitis (i.e. muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). Indeed, only aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate (collectively commonly referred to as alum) are routinely used as adjuvants in human and veterinary vaccines. The efficacy of alum in increasing antibody responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids is well established. Notwithstanding, it does have limitations. For example, alum is ineffective for influenza vaccination and inconsistently elicits a cell mediated immune response with other immunogens. The antibodies elicited by alum-adjuvanted antigens are mainly of the IgG1 isotype in the mouse, which may not be optimal for protection in vaccination contexts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvants may be characterized as “intrinsic” or “extrinsic”. Intrinsic adjuvants (such as lipopolysaccharides) are integral and normal components of agents which in themselves are used as vaccines (i.e. killed or attenuated bacteria). Extrinsic adjuvants are typically nonintegral immunomodulators generally linked to antigens in a noncovalent manner, and are formulated to enhance the host immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments of the invention, adjuvants can be at least one member chosen from the group consisting of cytokines, lymphokines, and co-stimulatory molecules. Examples include (but are not limited to) \ninterleukin\n 2, interleukin 12, \ninterleukin\n 6, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, GM-CSF, B7.1, B7.2, ICAM-1, LFA-3, and CD72. Particular embodiments specifically encompass the use of GM-CSF as an adjuvant (as taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,679,356, 5,904,920, 5,637,483, 5,759,535, 5,254,534, European Patent Application EP 211684, and published PCT document WO 97/28816—all of which are herein incorporated by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of potent extrinsic adjuvants have been described. These include (but are not limited to) saponins complexed to membrane protein antigens (immune stimulating complexes), pluronic polymers with mineral oil, killed mycobacteria and mineral oil, Freund's complete adjuvant, bacterial products such as muramyl dipeptide (MOP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as lipid A, and liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of saponins per se as adjuvants is also well known (Lacaille-Dubois, M. and Wagner, H. (1996) \nPhytomedicine \n2:363). For example, Quil A (derived from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja Saponaria Molina) and fractions thereof has been extensively described (i.e. U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,540; Kensil, C. R. (1996) \nCrit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst. \n12:1; and European Patent EP 362279). The haemolytic saponins QS21 and QS17 (HPLC purified fractions of Quil A) have been described as potent systemic adjuvants (U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,540; European Patent EP 362279). Also described in these references is the use of QS7 (a non-haemolytic fraction of Quil-A) which acts as a potent adjuvant for systemic vaccines. Use of QS21 is further described in Kensil et al. ((1991) \nJ. Immunol. \n146:431). Combinations of QS21 and polysorbate or cyclodextrin are also known (WO 9910008). Particulate adjuvant systems comprising fractions of Quil A (such as QS21 and QS7) are described in WO 9633739 and WO 9611711.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred adjuvant/immunostimulant is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (“CpG”). CpG is an abbreviation for cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide motifs present in DNA. CpG is known in the art as being an adjuvant when administered by both systemic and mucosal routes (WO 9602555; European Patent EP 468520; Davies et al. (1998) \nJ. Immunol. \n160:87; McCluskie and Davis (1998) \nJ. Immunol. \n161:4463). In a number of studies, synthetic oligonucleotides derived from BCG gene sequences have also been shown to be capable of inducing immunostimulatory effects (both in vitro and in vivo; Krieg, (1995) \nNature \n374:546). Detailed analyses of immunostimulatory oligonucleotide sequences has demonstrated that the CG motif must be in a certain sequence context, and that such sequences are common in bacterial DNA but are rare in vertebrate DNA. (For example, the immunostimulatory sequence is often: purine, purine, C, G, pyrimidine, pyrimidine, wherein the CG motif is not methylated; however other unmethylated CpG sequences are known to be immunostimulatory and as such may also be used in the present invention.) As will be evident to one of normal skill in the art, said CG motifs/sequences can be incorporated into nucleic acids of the invention per se, or reside on distinct nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of other adjuvants are taught in the art, and as such are encompassed by embodiments of this invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,283 granted to Lockhoff et al. (incorporated herein by reference) teaches glycolipid analogues and their use as adjuvants. These include N-glycosylamides, N-glycosylureas and N-glycosylcarbamates, each of which is substituted in the sugar residue by an amino acid, as immuno-modulators or adjuvants. Furthermore, Lockhoff et al. ((1991) \nChem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n30:1611) have reported that N-glycolipid analogs displaying structural similarities to the naturally-occurring glycolipids (such as glycophospholipids and glycoglycerolipids) are also capable of eliciting strong immune responses in both herpes simplex virus vaccine and pseudorabies virus vaccine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,258,029 granted to Moloney (incorporated herein by reference) teaches that octadecyl tyrosine hydrochloride (OTH) functions as an adjuvant when complexed with tetanus toxoid and formalin inactivated type I, II and III poliomyelitis virus vaccine. Nixon-George et al. ((1990) \nJ. Immunol. \n14:4798) have also reported that octadecyl esters of aromatic amino acids complexed with a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen enhanced the host immune responses against hepatitis B virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvant compounds may also be chosen from the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative. Adjuvant compounds are the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid which are cross-linked, especially with polyalkenyl ethers of sugars or polyalcohols. These compounds are known by the term carbomer (Pharmeuropa Vol. 8, No. 2, June 1996). Preferably, a solution of adjuvant according to the invention, especially of carbomer, is prepared in distilled water, preferably in the presence of sodium chloride, the solution obtained being at acidic pH. This stock solution is diluted by adding it to the desired quantity (for obtaining the desired final concentration), or a substantial part thereof, of water charged with NaCl, preferably physiological saline (NaCL 9 g/l) all at once in several portions with concomitant or subsequent neutralization (pH 7.3 to 7.4), preferably with NaOH. This solution at physiological pH will be used as it is for mixing with the immunizing agent; said mixture being amenable to storage in the freeze-dried, liquid or frozen form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPersons skilled in the art can also refer to U.S. Pat. No. 2,909,462 (incorporated herein by reference) which describes adjuvants encompassing acrylic polymers cross-linked with a polyhydroxylated compound having at least 3 hydroxyl groups (preferably not more than 8), the hydrogen atoms of the at least three hydroxyls being replaced by unsaturated aliphatic radicals having at least 2 carbon atoms. The preferred radicals are those containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g. vinyls, allyls and other ethylenically unsaturated groups). The unsaturated radicals may themselves contain other substituents, such as methyl. The products sold under the name Carbopol (BF Goodrich, Ohio, USA) are particularly appropriate. They are cross-linked with allyl sucrose or with allyl pentaerythritol. Among them, there may be mentioned Carbopol (for example, 974P, 934P and 971P). Among the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative, the copolymers EMA (Monsanto; which are copolymers of maleic anhydride and ethylene, linear or cross-linked, (for example cross-linked with divinyl ether)) are preferred. Reference may be made to J. Fields et al. ((1960) \nNature \n186: 778) for a further description of these chemicals (incorporated (herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further aspects of this invention, adjuvants useful for parenteral administration of immunizing agent include aluminum compounds (such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum hydroxy phosphate; but might also be a salt of calcium, iron or zinc, or may be an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine, or acylated sugars, cationically or anionically derivatised polysaccharides, or polyphosphazenes). The antigen can be precipitated with, or adsorbed onto, the aluminum compound according to standard protocols well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther adjuvants encompassed by embodiments of this invention include lipid A (in particular 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL). 3D-MPL is a well known adjuvant manufactured by Ribi Immunochem, Montana. It is often supplied chemically as a mixture of 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A with 4, 5, or 6 acylated chains. It can be prepared by the methods taught in GB 2122204B. A preferred form of 3D-MPL is in the form of a particulate formulation having a particle size less than 0.2 μm in diameter (European Patent EP 689454).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvants for mucosal immunization may include bacterial toxins (e.g., the cholera toxin (CT), the \nE. coli \nheat-labile toxin (LT), the \nClostridium difficile \ntoxin A and the pertussis toxin (PT), or combinations, subunits, toxoids, or mutants thereof). For example, a purified preparation of native cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) can be of use. Fragments, homologs, derivatives, and fusion to any of these toxins are also suitable, provided that they retain adjuvant activity. A mutant having reduced toxicity may be used. Mutants have been described (e.g., in WO 95/17211 (Arg-7-Lys CT mutant), WO 96/6627 (Arg-192-Gly LT mutant), and WO 95/34323 (Arg-9-Lys and Glu-129-Gly PT mutant)). Additional LT mutants include, for example Ser-63-Lys, Ala-69-Gly, Glu-110-Asp, and Glu-112-Asp mutants. Other adjuvants (such as a bacterial monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)) of various sources (e.g., \nE. coli, Salmonella minnesota, Salmonella typhimurium\n, or \nShigella flexneri\n) can also be used in the mucosal administration of immunizing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvants useful for both mucosal and parenteral immunization include polyphosphazene (for example, WO 95/2415), DC-chol (3 b-(N—(N′,N′-dimethyl aminomethane)-carbamoyl) cholesterol (for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,185 and WO 96/14831) and QS-21 (for example, WO 88/9336).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvants/immunostimulants as described herein may be formulated together with carriers, such as for example liposomes, oil in water emulsions, and/or metallic salts including aluminum salts (such as aluminum hydroxide). For example, 3D-MPL may be formulated with aluminum hydroxide (as discussed in EP 689454) or oil in water emulsions (as discussed in WO 9517210); QS21 may be advantageously formulated with cholesterol containing liposomes (as discussed in WO 9633739), in oil water emulsions (as discussed in WO 9517210) or alum (as discussed in WO 9815287). When formulated into vaccines, immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (i.e. CpGs) are generally administered in free solution together with free antigen (as discussed in WO 9602555; McCluskie and Davis (1998) Supra), covalently conjugated to an antigen (as discussed in WO 9816247), or formulated with a carrier such as aluminum hydroxide or alum (as discussed in Davies et al.

For example, a combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative (as described in WO 9400153, WO 9517210, WO 9633739, WO 9856414, WO 9912565, WO 9911214) can be used, or more particularly the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL (as described in WO 9400153). A combination of an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and a saponin (such as QS21), or a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A (preferably 3D-MPL) in combination with an aluminum salt also form a potent adjuvant for use in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following non-limiting example is illustrative of the present invention:\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example compares the intranodal injection with subcutaneous injection of a representative tumor antigen (modified gp100).\n\n\n \nMethods and Experimental Design\n\n\nTest System\n\n\n \n \n \nCynomolgus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) purpose bred animals.\n\n\n \nSupplier: Siconbrec “Simian Conservation Breeding & Research Center Inc.”, Fema Building, 44 Gil Puyat Avenue Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines.\n\n\n \n \n \nNumber of animals in the study: 12 (6 males and 6 females).\n\n\nAge at initiation of treatment: 26 to 38 months.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBody weight range at initiation of treatment (day −1):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmales: 1.73 to 2.34 kg\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfemales: 1.71 to 2.65 kg.\n\n\n \nAnimal Husbandry\n\n\n \n \n \nHousing: one air-conditioned room;\n\n\n \n \n \n \ntemperature: 19 to 25° C.

Incubate overnight at 4° \nC. Wash\n 4 times in 1×PBS.\n\n\n \nSaturation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlace\n 200 μL per well of RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, non essential amino acids, pyruvate, Hepes buffer and Peni-Strepto. \nIncubate\n 2 hours at 37° C.\n\n\n \nTest\n\n\n \n \n \nCells from the immunized animals are tested against (a) medium alone; (b) pooled peptides at a concentration of 1 mg/mL; and (c) a non specific stimulus (PMA-lono). The pooled peptides used in this Example to stimulate IFN-γ production were derived from gp100 and are illustrated in Tables 4 to 7. The final volume of each sample is 200 μL. \nIncubate\n 20 hours at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \nWash\n 4 times in 1×PBS and 0.05\n% Tween\n 20.\n\n\n \nDetection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlace\n 100 μL per well of detection antibodies at 1 μg/mL diluted in 1/1000 1×PBS, 1% BSA and 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. \nIncubate\n 2 hours at room temperature. \nWash\n 4 times in 1×PBS and 0.05\n% Tween\n 20.\n\n\n \nReaction\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlace\n 100 μL per well of Extravidin-PA conjugate diluted 1/6000 in 1×PBS, 1% BSA and 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. \nIncubate\n 45 minutes at room temperature. \nWash\n 4 times in 1×PBS and 0.05\n% Tween\n 20.\n\n\n \nSubstrate Addition\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlace\n 100 μL per well of substrate previously prepared. For example, for 1 plate, prepare: 9.6 mL of distilled water, 0.4 mL of 25× buffer, 0.1 mL of solution A (NBT) and 0.1 mL of solution B (BCIP). Incubate 30-45 minutes at room temperature. Wash in distilled water. Dry and transfer to a plastic film. The number of spots are counted using a Zeiss image analyzer. Each spot corresponds to an individual IFN-γ secreting T cell.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe animals that tested positive on the ELISPOT analysis are shown in \nFIGS. 1-4\n. Overall, the results demonstrate that of the animals tested, 2 out of 2 (i.e. 100%) of the animals that received the intranodal administration of the gp100 antigen, and 2 out of 4 (i.e. 50%) of the animals that received the subcutaneous administration of the gp100 antigen had a positive cell mediated immune response.\n\n\n \nELISA Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ELISA was performed utilizing standard methodology known in the art. Briefly, the human gp100 (“hgp100”; produced in Baculovirus) was diluted in coating buffer (carbonate-bicarbonate, pH9.6) and added to 96 wells at 0.5 ug/well. Plates were placed at 4° C. overnight. Plates were then washed and blocking buffer (phosphate buffered saline/0.5\n% Tween\n 20/1.0% BSA, pH7.2) was added for 2 hours at 37° C. The plates were then washed and the sera was diluted in dilution buffer (phosphate buffered saline/0.5\n% Tween\n 20/0.1 BSA, pH7.2). For this study, monkey sera was diluted to 1:800 and “7” serial 3 fold dilutions were done for each sample tested. The human sera controls were diluted to 1:50 in dilution buffer and “7” serial 2 fold dilutions were performed. Each dilution was done in duplicate. The plates were incubated a further 2 hours at 37° C. The plates were washed and the horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human secondary antibody (anti-human Ig whole antibody from sheep (Amersham Life Science, NA933)) diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer was added to the wells and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. The plates were washed and OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) substrate with H\n2\nO\n2 \nin substrate buffer (50 mM phosphate/25 mM citrate, pH 7.2) was added to the wells. For a kinetics ELISA, the plate was read repeatedly (2 minute intervals for 15 minutes) unstopped (without “stop” buffer). Plates were read at 450 nm.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe results of the above experiment are presented in Table 8 and in \nFIG. 5\n. The animals of \ngroup\n 2 received intranodal injections of ALVAC(2)-gp100(mod) followed by boosts with the modified gp100 peptides 209(2M) and 290(9V); the animals in \ngroup\n 3 received a subcutaneous injection of the ALVAC(2) construct followed by peptide boosts; the animals in \ngroup\n 1 received intranodal injections of saline as a control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from \nFIG. 5\n, intranodal injection of the antigens induced a humoral response that was much greater than when the antigen was injected subcutaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, the results of this Example demonstrate that intranodal injection of a tumor antigen induces both a humoral and cell mediated response that is much greater than when the tumor antigen is injected by the conventional subcutaneous route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred examples, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed examples.

A pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound or salt as claimed in \nclaim 22\n and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds useful in the inhibition of metalloproteinases and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these, as well as their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention are inhibitors of one or more metalloproteinase enzymes. Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N. M. Hooper (1994) FEBS Letters 354:1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10, MMP11), matrilysin (MMP7), metalloelastase (MMP12), enamelysin (MMP19), the MT-MMPs (MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17); the reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC family which is includes the secretases and sheddases such as TNF converting enzymes (ADAM10 and TACE); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloproteinases such as aggrecanase, the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes that involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibronectin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al., (1997) Biochem J. 321:265-279).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetalloproteinases have been associated with many diseases or conditions. Inhibition of the activity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these diseases or conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), corneal ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atherosclerosis; asthma; rhinitis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMP12, also known as macrophage elastase or metalloelastase, was initially cloned in the mouse by Shapiro et al [1992, Journal of Biological Chemistry 267: 4664] and in man by the same group in 1995. MMP-12 is preferentially expressed in activated macrophages, and has been shown to be secreted from alveolar macrophages from smokers [Shapiro et al, 1993, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 268: 23824] as well as in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions [Matsumoto et al, 1998, Am J Pathol 153: 109]. A mouse model of COPD is based on challenge of mice with cigarette smoke for six months, two cigarettes a day six days a week. Wildtype mice developed pulmonary emphysema after this treatment. When MMP12 knock-out mice were tested in this model they developed no significant emphysema, strongly indicating that MMP-12 is a key enzyme in the COPD pathogenesis. The role of MMPs such as MMP12 in COPD (emphysema and bronchitis) is discussed in Anderson and Shinagawa, 1999, Current Opinion in Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Investigational Drugs 1(1): 29-38. It was recently discovered that smoking increases macrophage infiltration and macrophage-derived MMP-12 expression in human carotid artery plaques Kangavari [Matetzky S, Fishbein M C et al., Circulation 102:(18), 36-39 Suppl. S, Oct. 31, 2000].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMP13, or collagenase 3, was initially cloned from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumour [J. M. P. Freije et al. (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry 269(24):16766-16773]. PCR-RNA analysis of RNAs from a wide range of tissues indicated that MMP13 expression was limited to breast carcinomas as it was not found in breast fibroadenomas, normal or resting mammary gland, placenta, liver, ovary, uterus, prostate or parotid gland or in breast cancer cell lines (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR75-1). Subsequent to this observation MMP13 has been detected in transformed epidermal keratinocytes [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8(2):243-250], squamous cell carcinomas [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 151(2):499-508] and epidermal tumours [K. Airola et al., (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(2):225-231]. These results are suggestive that MMP13 is secreted by transformed epithelial cells and may be involved in the extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interaction associated with metastasis especially as observed in invasive breast cancer lesions and in malignant epithelia growth in skin carcinogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent published data implies that MMP13 plays a role in the turnover of other connective tissues. For instance, consistent with MMP13's substrate specificity and preference for degrading type II collagen [P. G. Mitchell et al., (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; V. Knauper et al., (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271:1544-1550], MMP13 has been hypothesised to serve a role during primary ossification and skeletal remodelling [M. Stahle-Backdahl et al., (1997) Lab. Invest. 76(5):717-728; N. Johansson et al., (1997) Dev. Dyn. 208(3):387-397], in destructive joint diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis [D. Wernicke et al., (1996) J. Rheumatol. 23:590-595; P. G. Mitchell et al., (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; O. Lindy et al., (1997) Arthritis Rheum 40(8):1391-1399]; and during the aseptic loosening of hip replacements [S. Imai et al., (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 80(4):701-710]. MMP13 has also been implicated in chronic adult periodontitis as it has been localised to the epithelium of chronically inflamed mucosa human gingival tissue [V. J. Uitto et al., (1998) Am. J. Pathol 152(6):1489-1499] and in remodelling of the collagenous matrix in chronic wounds [M. Vaalamo et al., (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(1):96-101].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMP9 (Gelatinase B; 92 kDa TypeIV Collagenase; 92 kDa Gelatinase) is a secreted protein which was first purified, then cloned and sequenced, in 1989 [S. M. Wilhelm et al (1989) J. Biol Chem. 264 (29): 17213-17221; published erratum in J. Biol Chem. (1990) 265 (36): 22570]. A recent review of MMP9 provides an excellent source for detailed information and references on this protease: T. H. Vu & Z. Werb (1998) (In: Matrix Metalloproteinases. 1998. Edited by W. C. Parks & R. P. Mecham. pp 115-148. Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-545090-7). The following points are drawn from that review to by T. H. Vu & Z. Werb (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression of MMP9 is restricted normally to a few cell types, including trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages. However, it's expression can be induced in these same cells and in other cell types by several mediators, including exposure of the cells to growth factors or cytokines. These are the same mediators often implicated in initiating an inflammatory response. As with other secreted MMPs, MMP9 is released as an inactive Pro-enzyme which is subsequently cleaved to form the enzymatically active enzyme. The proteases required for this activation in vivo are not known. The balance of active MMP9 versus inactive enzyme is further regulated in vivo by interaction with TIMP-1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1), a naturally-occurring protein. TIMP-1 binds to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine the amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V collagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic implantation; some role in the growth and development of bones; and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMP-9 release, measured using enzyme immunoassay, was significantly enhanced in fluids and in AM supernantants from untreated asthmatics compared with those from other populations [Am. J. Resp. Cell & Mol. Biol., November 1997, 17 (51:583-591]. Also, increased MMP9 expression has been observed in certain other pathological conditions, thereby implicating MMP9 in disease processes such as COPD, arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as Myocardial Infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMP-8 (collagenase-2, neutrophil collagenase) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase family that is preferentially expressed in neutrophils. Later studies indicate MMP-8 is expressed also in other cells, such as osteoarthritic chondrocytes [Shlopov et al, 1997, Arthritis Rheum, 40:2065]. MMPs produced by neutrophils can cause tissue remodelling, and hence blocking MMP-8 should have a positive effect in fibrotic diseases of for instance the lung, and in degradative diseases like pulmonary emphysema. MMP-8 was also found to be up-regulated in osteoarthritis, indicating that blocking MMP-8 many also be beneficial in this disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMP-3 (stromelysin-1) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme family. MMP-3 activity has been demonstrated in fibroblasts isolated from inflamed gingiva [Uitto V. J. et al, 1981, J. Periodontal Res., 16:417-424], and enzyme levels have been correlated to the severity of gum disease [Overall C. M. et al, 1987, J. Periodontal Res., 22:81-88]. MMP-3 is also produced by basal keratinocytes in a variety of chronic ulcers [Saarialho-Kere U. K. et al, 1994, J. Clin. Invest., 94:79-88]. MMP-3 mRNA and protein were detected in basal keratinocytes adjacent to but distal from the wound edge in what probably represents the sites of proliferating epidermis. MMP-3 may thus prevent the epidermis from healing. Several investigators have demonstrated consistent elevation of MMP-3 in synovial fluids from rheumatoid and osteoarthritis patients as compared to controls [Walakovits L. A. et al, 1992, Arthritis Rheum., 35:35-42; Zafarullah M. et al, 1993, J. Rheumatol., 20:693-697]. These studies provided the basis for the belief that an inhibitor of MMP-3 will treat diseases involving disruption of extracellular matrix resulting in inflammation due to lymphocytic infiltration, or loss of structural integrity necessary for organ function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known (see for example the review of MMP inhibitors by Beckett R. P. and Whittaker M., 1998, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 8(3):259-282]. Different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibiting various metalloproteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhittaker M. et al (1999, Chemical Reviews 99(9):2735-2776] review a wide range of known MMP inhibitor compounds. They state that an effective MMP inhibitor requires a zinc binding group or ZBG (functional group capable of chelating the active site zinc(II) ion), at least one functional group which provides a hydrogen bond interaction with the enzyme backbone, and one or more side chains which undergo effective van der Waals interactions with the enzyme subsites. Zinc binding groups in known MMP inhibitors include carboxylic acid groups, hydroxamic acid groups, sulfhydryl or mercapto, etc. For example, Whittaker M. et al discuss the following MMP inhibitors:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe above compound entered clinical development.

It has a non-peptidic succinyl hydroxamate zinc binding group and a cyclic imide group at P1. Whittaker M. et al also discuss other MMP inhibitors having a P1 cyclic imido group and various zinc binding groups (succinyl hydroxamate, carboxylic acid, thiol group, phosphorous-based group).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe above compounds appear to be good inhibitors of MMP8 and MMP9 (PCT patent applications WO9858925, WO9858915). They have a pyrimidin-2,3,4-trione zinc binding group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following compounds are not known as MMP inhibitors:—\n\n\n \n \nLora-Tamayo, M et al (1968, An.

Albini et al., (1987) Cancer Research 47:3239-3245.\n\n\n \nTest as an Agent to Inhibit Whole Blood TNF Sheddase Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFα production is assessed in a human whole blood assay where LPS is used to stimulate the release of TNFα. Heparinized (10 Units/ml) human blood obtained from volunteers is diluted 1:5 with medium (RPMI1640+bicarbonate, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine) and incubated (160 μl) with 20 μl of test compound (triplicates), in DMSO or appropriate vehicle, for 30 min at 37° C. in a humidified (5% CO\n2\n/95% air) incubator, prior to addition of 20 μl LPS (\nE. coli. \n0111:B4; final concentration 10 μg/ml). Each assay includes controls of diluted blood incubated with medium alone (6 wells/plate) or a known TNFα inhibitor as standard. The plates are then incubated for 6 hours at 37° C. (humidified incubator), centrifuged (2000 rpm for 10 min; 4° C.), plasma harvested (50-100 μl) and stored in 96 well plates at −70° C. before subsequent analysis for TNFα concentration by ELISA.\n\n\n \nTest as an Agent to Inhibit In Vitro Cartilage Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit the degradation of the aggrecan or collagen components of cartilage can be assessed essentially as described by K. M. Bottomley et al., (1997) Biochem J. 323:483-488.\n\n\n \nPharmacodynamic Test\n\n\n \n \n \nTo evaluate the clearance properties and bioavailability of the compounds of this invention an ex vivo pharmacodynamic test is employed which utilises the synthetic substrate assays above or alternatively HPLC or Mass spectrometric analysis. This is a generic test which can be used to estimate the clearance rate of compounds across a range of species. Animals (e,g. rats, marmosets) are dosed iv or po with a soluble formulation of compound (such as 20% w/v DMSO, 60% w/v PEG400) and at subsequent time points (e.g. 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720, 1220 mins) the blood samples are taken from an appropriate vessel into IOU heparin. Plasma fractions are obtained following centrifugation and the plasma proteins precipitated with acetonitrile (80% w/v final concentration). After 30 mins at −20° C. the plasma proteins are sedimented by centrifugation and the supernatant fraction is evaporated to dryness using a Savant speed vac. The sediment is reconstituted in assay buffer and subsequently analysed for compound content using the synthetic substrate assay. Briefly, a compound concentration-response curve is constructed for the compound undergoing evaluation. Serial dilutions of the reconstituted plasma extracts are assessed for activity and the amount of compound present in the original plasma sample is calculated using the concentration-response curve taking into account the total plasma dilution factor.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Assessment\n\n\nTest as an Anti-TNF Agent\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFα inhibitors is assessed in the rat. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (180-210 g) are dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route e.g. peroral (p.o.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.). Ninety minutes later rats are sacrificed using a rising concentration of CO\n2 \nand bled out via the posterior vena cavae into 5 Units of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples are immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. and the harvested plasmas frozen at −20° C. for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFα production by LPS-stimulated human blood. The rat plasma samples are thawed and 175 μl of each sample are added to a set format pattern in a 96 U well plate. Fifty μl of heparinized human blood is then added to each well, mixed and the plate is incubated for 30 min at 37° C. (humidified incubator). LPS (25 μl; final concentration 10 μg/ml) is added to the wells and incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells are incubated with 25 μl of medium alone. Plates are then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200 μl of the supernatants are transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at −20° C. for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData analysis by dedicated software calculates for each compound/dose:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTNF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTNF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nControls\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTNF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nTreated\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTNF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nControls\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTest as an Anti-Arthritic Agent\n\n\n \n \n \nActivity of a compound as an anti-arthritic is tested in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) as defined by D.

The Sequence Listing is provided as a file entitled INTMU-049VPC.TXT, created April 14, 2009, which is 4 Kb in size. The information in the electronic format of the Sequence Listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention\n\n\n[0003] The present invention relates to compounds, processes for their synthesis, compositions and methods for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\n[0004] Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common chronic blood borne infection in the United States. Although the numbers of new infections have declined, the burden of chronic infection is substantial, with Centers for Disease Control estimates of 3.9 million (1.8%) infected persons in the United States. Chronic liver disease is the tenth leading cause of death among adults in the United States, and accounts for approximately 25,000 deaths annually, or approximately 1% of all deaths. Studies indicate that 40% of chronic liver disease is HCV-related, resulting in an estimated 8,000-10,000 deaths each year. HCV-associated end-stage liver disease is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation among adults.\n\n\n[0005] Antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C has evolved rapidly over the last decade, with significant improvements seen in the efficacy of treatment. Nevertheless, even with combination therapy using pegylated IFN-α plus ribavirin, 40% to 50% of patients fail therapy, i.e., are nonresponders (NR) or relapsers. These patients currently have no effective therapeutic alternative. In particular, patients who have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver \n\n biopsy are at significant risk of developing complications of advanced liver disease, including ascites, jaundice, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, and progressive liver failure, as well as a markedly increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\n[0006] The high prevalence of chronic HCV infection has important public health implications for the future burden of chronic liver disease in the United States. Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) indicate that a large increase in the rate of new HCV infections occurred from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, particularly among persons between 20 to 40 years of age. It is estimated that the number of persons with long-standing HCV infection of 20 years or longer could more than quadruple from 1990 to 2015, from 750,000 to over 3 million. The proportional increase in persons infected for 30 or 40 years would be even greater. Since the risk of HCV-related chronic liver disease is related to the duration of infection, with the risk of cirrhosis progressively increasing for persons infected for longer than 20 years, this will result in a substantial increase in cirrhosis-related morbidity and mortality among patients infected between the years of 1965-1985.\n\n\n[0007] HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in lingth and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non- structural (NS) proteins of the virus. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first viral protease cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction of the polyprotein. The second viral protease is serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (herein referred to as \"NS3 protease\"). NS3 protease mediates all of the subsequent cleavage events at sites downstream relative to the position of NS3 in the polyprotein (i.e., sites located between the C-terminus of NS3 and the C-terminus of the polyprotein). NS 3 protease exhibits activity both in cis, at the NS 3 -NS 4 cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, and NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein is believed to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. Apparently, the formation of the complex between NS3 and NS4A is necessary for NS3-mediated processing events and enhances proteolytic efficiency at all sites recognized by NS3. The NS3 protease also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA \n\n helicase activities. NS5B is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involved in the replication of HCV RNA.\n\n\nSUMMARY QF THE INVENTION [0008] The present embodiments provide compounds of the general Formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof wherein:\n\n\nR\n1\n is-(CR\n5\nR\n6\n)\nn\nR\n4\n;

Furthermore, \"substantially continuous\" drug delivery can also encompass delivery of drug at a substantially constant, pre-selected rate or range of rates (e.g., amount of drug per unit time, or volume of drug formulation for a unit time) that is substantially uninterrupted for a pre-selected period of drug delivery.\n\n\n[0037] By \"substantially steady state\" as used in the context of a biological parameter that may vary as a function of time, it is meant that the biological parameter exhibits a substantially constant value over a time course, such that the area under the curve defined by the value of the biological parameter as a function of time for any 8 hour period during the time course (AUC8hr) is no more than about 20% above or about 20% below, and preferably no more than about 15% above or about 15% below, and more preferably no more than about 10% above or about 10% below, the average area under the curve of the biological parameter over an 8 hour period during the time course (AUC8hr average). The AUC8hr average is defined as the quotient (q) of the area under the curve of the biological parameter over the entirety of the time course (AUCtotal) divided by the number of 8 hour intervals in the time course (total/3days), i.e., q = (AUCtotal)/ (total/3days). For example, in the context of a serum concentration of a drug, the serum concentration of the drug is maintained at a substantially steady state during a time course when the area under the curve of serum \n\n concentration of the drug over time for any 8 hour period during the time course (AUC8hr) is no more than about 20% above or about 20% below the average area under the curve of serum concentration of the drug over an 8 hour period in the time course (AUC8hr average), i.e., the AUC8hr is no more than 20% above or 20% below the AUC8hr average for the serum concentration of the drug over the time course.\n\n\n[0038] The term \"alkyl\" as used herein refers to a radical of a fully saturated hydrocarbon, including, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,\n\n\nisobutyl, tert-butyl, n-hexyl, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, and the like.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the term \"alkyl\" as used herein includes radicals of fully saturated hydrocarbons defined by the following general formula's: the general formula for linear or branched fully saturated hydrocarbons not containing a cyclic structure is C\nn\nH\n2n+2\n; the general formula for a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing one ring is C\nn\nH\n2n\n; the general formula for a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing two rings is C\nn\nH\n2(n\n-i\n)\n; the general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon containing three rings is C\nn\nH\n2\n(\nn\n-\n2\n).\n\n\n[0039] The term \"halo\" used herein refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo.\n\n\n[0040] The term \"alkoxy\" used herein refers to straight or branched chain alkyl radical covalently bonded to the parent molecule through an — O— linkage.

All such isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers, as well as the mixtures thereof are intended to be included in the scope of the recited compound. In certain cases, compounds can exist in tautomeric forms. All tautomeric forms are intended to be included in the scope. Likewise, when compounds contain an alkenyl or alkenylene group, there exists the possibility of cis- and trans- isomeric forms of the compounds. Both cis- and trans- isomers, as well as the mixtures of cis- and trans- isomers, are contemplated.

At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present, the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen, including but not limited to hydrogen- 1 (protium) and hydrogen-2 (deuterium). Thus, reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n[0073] Various forms are included in the embodiments, including polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, conformers, salts, and prodrug derivatives. A polymorph is a composition having the same chemical formula, but a different structure. A solvate is a composition formed by solvation (the combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute). A hydrate is a compound formed by an incorporation of water. A conformer is a structure that is a conformational isomer. Conformational isomerism is the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but different conformations (conformers) of atoms about a rotating bond. Salts of compounds can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, salts of compounds can be prepared by reacting the appropriate base or acid with a stoichiometric equivalent of the compound. A prodrug is a compound that undergoes biotransformation (chemical conversion) before exhibiting its \n\n pharmacological effects. For example, a prodrug can thus be viewed as a drug containing specialized protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate undesirable properties in the parent molecule. Thus, reference herein to a compound includes all of the aforementioned forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n[0074] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the embodiments. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either both of those included limits are also included in the embodiments.\n\n\n[0075] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the embodiments belong. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can also be used in the practice or testing of the embodiments, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited.\n\n\n[0076] It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"and,\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Exemplary moieties include, but are not limited to, atoms of the peptide backbone or side chains of amino acids Lysl36, Glyl37, Serl39, His57, Gly58, Gln41, Ser42, and Phe43, see Yao. et. al., Structure 1999, 7, 1353.\n\n\n[0216] As used herein, an NS3 protease S2 pocket moiety refers to a moiety of the NS 3 protease that interacts with the amino acid positioned two residues N-terminal to the cleavage site of the substrate polypeptide cleaved by NS3 protease (e.g., the NS3 protease moieties that interact with amino acid V in the polypeptide substrate DLEVVT-STWVLV, SEQ ID NO: 1). Exemplary moieties include, but are not limited to, atoms of the peptide backbone or side chains of amino acids His57, Argl55, Val78, Asp79, Gln80 and Asp81, see Yao. et. al., Structure 1999, 7, 1353.\n\n\n[0217] Embodiments described herein include compounds containing moieties having a size, configuration and/or position selected to interact and/or be in proximity to particular regions, particular amino acid residues, and/or particular atoms of NS3 protease, upon binding of the compound to NS3 protease.

For example the Pi' moiety may form a non-polar interaction with at least one amino acid selected from Lysl36, Glyl37, Serl39, His57, Gly58, Gln41, Ser42, and Phe43. The moieties C\n3\n_\n7\n cycloalkyl, C\n4\n_i\n0\n alkylcycloalkyl and di(C\n1-4\n alkyl)amine are examples of Pi' moieties. Examples of Y-Pi' include -NH-SO\n2\n- methylcyclopropyl and -NH-SO\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n.\n\n\n[0219] In a similar fashion, in an embodiment of the compound of the general formulae (X) and (Xa), the P\n2\n moiety has a size and configuration such that, upon binding of the compound to NS3 protease, at least one atom of P\n2\n is within 5 A or less of any backbone or side chain atom of at least one NS3 protease residue selected from the group consisting of Tyr56, His57, Val78, Asp79, Gln80, Asp81, Argl55 and Alal56. In an embodiment of the compound of the general formulae (X) and (Xa), P\n2\n is positioned by L to provide this configuration, where L is a moiety consisting of from 1 to 5 atoms selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur. In an embodiment, L is an oxygen atom. In another embodiment, L may contain 2 to 5 atoms selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur. For example, L may contain a moiety having the formula -W-C(=V)-, where V and W are each individually selected from O, S or NH. Specific exemplary moieties for L include, but are not limited to, ester, amide, carbamate, thioester, and thioamide. In some embodiments, P\n2\n may be selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted aryl, substituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, unsubstituted heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic.\n\n\n[0220] In another embodiment of the compound of the general formulae (X) and (Xa), the P\n2\n moiety has a size and configuration such that, upon binding of the compound to NS 3 protease, at least one atom of P\n2\n forms a non-polar interaction with peptide backbone or side chain atom or atoms located in the substrate binding pocket of NS3 protease, including, but not limited to amino acid residues that form the NS3 protease S2 pocket. For example the P\n2\n moiety may form a non-polar interaction with at least one amino acid selected from His57, Argl55, Val78, Asp79, Gln80 and Asp81. The P\n2\n moiety also may be configured to form a hydrogen bond with peptide backbone or side chain atom or atoms located in the substrate binding pocket of NS3 protease, including, but not limited to amino acid residues that form the NS 3 protease S2 pocket. For example the P\n2\n moiety may form a hydrogen bond with at \n\n least one amino acid selected from His57, Argl55, Val78, Asp79, Gln80 and Asp81. In some instances, P\n2\n may form both a non-polar interaction and a hydrogen bond with peptide backbone or side chain moieties or atoms located in the substrate binding pocket of NS3 protease, such amino acids selected from His57, Argl55, Val78, Asp79, Gln80 and Asp81. Such hydrogen bond and non-polar interactions may occur with the same amino acid residue or with different amino acid residues in the NS 3 protease S 2 pocket. In an embodiment of the compound of the general formulae (X) and (Xa), P\n2\n is positioned by L to provide this configuration, where L is a moiety as described above. In some embodiments, P\n2\n may be selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted aryl, substituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, unsubstituted heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic.\n\n\n[0221] In another embodiment of the compound of the general formulae (X) and (Xa), the R\n50\n and R\n60\n moieties have a size, configuration and/or positioning such that, upon binding of the compound to NS3 protease, at least one atom of R\n50\n or R\n60\n is within 5 A or less of any backbone or side chain atom of at least one NS3 protease residue selected from the group consisting of Argl23, Alal56, Alal57, Vall58, Cysl59, and Aspl68.

Whether a subject compound inhibits HCV viral replication can be determined using methods known in the art, including an in vitro viral replication assay.\n\n\nTreating a hepatitis virus infection\n\n\n[0235] The methods and compositions described herein are generally useful in treatment of an of HCV infection.\n\n\n[0236] Whether a subject method is effective in treating an HCV infection can be determined by a reduction in viral load, a reduction in time to seroconversion (virus undetectable in patient serum), an increase in the rate of sustained viral response to therapy, a reduction of morbidity or mortality in clinical outcomes, or other indicator of disease response.\n\n\n[0237] In general, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, IE, IV, V, VI, Vπ, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to reduce viral load or achieve a sustained viral response to therapy. \n\n [0238] Whether a subject method is effective in treating an HCV infection can be determined by measuring viral load, or by measuring a parameter associated with HCV infection, including, but not limited to, liver fibrosis, elevations in serum transaminase levels, and necroinflammatory activity in the liver. Indicators of liver fibrosis are discussed in detail below.\n\n\n[0239] The method involves administering an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, optionally in combination with an effective amount of one or more additional antiviral agents. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to reduce viral titers to undetectable levels, e.g., to about 1000 to about 5000, to about 500 to about 1000, or to about 100 to about 500 genome copies/mL serum. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to reduce viral load to lower than 100 genome copies/mL serum.\n\n\n[0240] In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, E, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to achieve a 1.5-log, a 2-log, a 2.5-log, a 3-log, a 3.5-log, a 4-log, a 4.5-log, or a 5-log reduction in viral titer in the serum of the individual.\n\n\n[0241] In many embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, E, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to achieve a sustained viral response, e.g., non-detectable or substantially non-detectable HCV RNA (e.g., less than about 500, less than about 400, less than about 200, or less than about 100 genome copies per milliliter serum) is found in the patient's serum for a period of at least about one month, at least about two months, at least about three months, at least about four months, at least about five months, or at least about six months following cessation of therapy.\n\n\n[0242] As noted above, whether a subject method is effective in treating an HCV infection can be determined by measuring a parameter associated with HCV infection, such as liver fibrosis. Methods of determining the extent of liver fibrosis are discussed in detail below. In some embodiments, the level of a serum marker of liver fibrosis indicates the degree of liver fibrosis.\n\n\n[0243] As one non-limiting example, levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are measured, using standard assays. In general, an ALT level of less than about 45 \n\n international units is considered normal. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount effective to reduce ALT levels to less than about 45 IU/mL serum.\n\n\n[0244] A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to reduce a serum level of a marker of liver fibrosis by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or more, compared to the level of the marker in an untreated individual, or to a placebo-treated individual. Methods of measuring serum markers include immunological -based methods, e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), radioimmunoassays, and the like, using antibody specific for a given serum marker.\n\n\n[0245] In many embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, EI, IV, V, VI, Vn, or X and an additional antiviral agent is a synergistic amount. The additional antiviral agent may itself be a combination of antiviral agents, e.g., a combination of pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin. As used herein, a \"synergistic combination\" or a \"synergistic amount\" of a compound of Formulae I, π, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X and an additional antiviral agent is a combined dosage that is more effective in the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of an HCV infection than the incremental improvement in treatment outcome that could be predicted or expected from a merely additive combination of (i) the therapeutic or prophylactic benefit of the compound of Formulae I, π, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X when administered at that same dosage as a monotherapy and (ii) the therapeutic or prophylactic benefit of the additional antiviral agent when administered at the same dosage as a monotherapy.\n\n\n[0246] In some embodiments, a selected amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, HI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X and a selected amount of an additional antiviral agent are effective when used in combination therapy for a disease, but the selected amount of the compound of Formulae I, II, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X and/or the selected amount of the additional antiviral agent is ineffective when used in monotherapy for the disease. Thus, the embodiments encompass (1) regimens in which a selected amount of the additional antiviral agent enhances the therapeutic benefit of a selected amount of the compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, \n\n VII, or X when used in combination therapy for a disease, where the selected amount of the additional antiviral agent provides no therapeutic benefit when used in monotherapy for the disease (2) regimens in which a selected amount of the compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, Vπ, or X enhances the therapeutic benefit of a selected amount of the additional antiviral agent when used in combination therapy for a disease, where the selected amount of the compound of Formulae I, π, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or X provides no therapeutic benefit when used in monotherapy for the disease and (3) regimens in which a selected amount of the compound of Formulae I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or X and a selected amount of the additional antiviral agent provide a therapeutic benefit when used in combination therapy for a disease, where each of the selected amounts of the compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X and the additional antiviral agent, respectively, provides no therapeutic benefit when used in monotherapy for the disease. As used herein, a \"synergistically effective amount\" of a compound of Formulae I, π, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X and an additional antiviral agent, and its grammatical equivalents, shall be understood to include any regimen encompassed by any of (l)-(3) above. Fibrosis\n\n\n[0247] The embodiments provides methods for treating liver fibrosis (including forms of liver fibrosis resulting from, or associated with, HCV infection), generally involving administering a therapeutic amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents. Effective amounts of compounds of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, with and without one or more additional antiviral agents, as well as dosing regimens, are as discussed below.\n\n\n[0248] Whether treatment with a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is effective in reducing liver fibrosis is determined by any of a number of well-established techniques for measuring liver fibrosis and liver function. Liver fibrosis reduction is determined by analyzing a liver biopsy sample. An analysis of a liver biopsy comprises assessments of two major components: necroinflammation assessed by \"grade\" as a measure of the severity and ongoing disease activity, and the lesions of fibrosis and parenchymal or vascular remodeling as assessed by \"stage\" as being reflective of long-term disease progression. See, e.g., Brunt (2000) Hepatol. 31:241-246; and METAVIR (1994) Hepatology 20:15-20. Based on analysis of the liver biopsy, a score is assigned. A number of standardized scoring systems exist which provide a \n\n quantitative assessment of the degree and severity of fibrosis. These include the METAVIR, Knodell, Scheuer, Ludwig, and Ishak scoring systems.\n\n\n[0249] The METAVIR scoring system is based on an analysis of various features of a liver biopsy, including fibrosis (portal fibrosis, centrilobular fibrosis, and cirrhosis); necrosis (piecemeal and lobular necrosis, acidophilic retraction, and ballooning degeneration); inflammation (portal tract inflammation, portal lymphoid aggregates, and distribution of portal inflammation); bile duct changes; and the Knodell index (scores of periportal necrosis, lobular necrosis, portal inflammation, fibrosis, and overall disease activity). The definitions of each stage in the METAVIR system are as follows: score: 0, no fibrosis; score: 1, stellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formation; score: 2, enlargement of portal tract with rare septa formation; score: 3, numerous septa without cirrhosis; and score: 4, cirrhosis.\n\n\n[0250] Knodell's scoring system, also called the Hepatitis Activity Index, classifies specimens based on scores in four categories of histologic features: I. Periportal and/or bridging necrosis; II. Intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis; III. Portal inflammation; and IV. Fibrosis. In the Knodell staging system, scores are as follows: score: 0, no fibrosis; score: 1, mild fibrosis (fibrous portal expansion); score: 2, moderate fibrosis; score: 3, severe fibrosis (bridging fibrosis); and score: 4, cirrhosis. The higher the score, the more severe the liver tissue damage. Knodell (1981) Hepatol. 1:431.\n\n\n[0251] In the Scheuer scoring system scores are as follows: score: 0, no fibrosis; score: 1, enlarged, fibrotic portal tracts; score: 2, periportal or portal-portal septa, but intact architecture; score: 3, fibrosis with architectural distortion, but no obvious cirrhosis; score: 4, probable or definite cirrhosis. Scheuer (1991) J. Hepatol. 13:372.\n\n\n[0252] The Ishak scoring system is described in Ishak (1995) J. Hepatol. 22:696- 699. Stage 0, No fibrosis; Stage 1, Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; stage 2, Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa; stage 3, Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal (P-P) bridging; stage 4, Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (P-P) as well as portal-central (P-C); stage 5, Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis); stage 6, Cirrhosis, probable or definite.\n\n\n[0253] The benefit of anti-fibrotic therapy can also be measured and assessed by using the Child-Pugh scoring system which comprises a multicomponent point system based upon abnormalities in serum bilirubin level, serum albumin level, prothrombin time, the \n\n presence and severity of ascites, and the presence and severity of encephalopathy. Based upon the presence and severity of abnormality of these parameters, patients may be placed in one of three categories of increasing severity of clinical disease: A, B, or C.\n\n\n[0254] In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that effects a change of one unit or more in the fibrosis stage based on pre- and post- therapy liver biopsies. In particular embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, EI, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, reduces liver fibrosis by at least one unit in the METAVEl, the Knodell, the Scheuer, the Ludwig, or the Ishak scoring system.\n\n\n[0255] Secondary, or indirect, indices of liver function can also be used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VE, or X. Morphometric computerized semi- automated assessment of the quantitative degree of liver fibrosis based upon specific staining of collagen and/or serum markers of liver fibrosis can also be measured as an indication of the efficacy of a subject treatment method. Secondary indices of liver function include, but are not limited to, serum transaminase levels, prothrombin time, bilirubin, platelet count, portal pressure, albumin level, and assessment of the Child-Pugh score.\n\n\n[0256] An effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to increase an index of liver function by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or more, compared to the index of liver function in an untreated individual, or to a placebo-treated individual. Those skilled in the art can readily measure such indices of liver function, using standard assay methods, many of which are commercially available, and are used routinely in clinical settings.\n\n\n[0257] Serum markers of liver fibrosis can also be measured as an indication of the efficacy of a subject treatment method. Serum markers of liver fibrosis include, but are not limited to, hyaluronate, N-terminal procollagen EI peptide, 7S domain of type IV collagen, C-terminal procollagen I peptide, and laminin. Additional biochemical markers of liver fibrosis include α-2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, gamma globulin, apolipoprotein A, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. \n\n [0258] A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective to reduce a serum level of a marker of liver fibrosis by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or more, compared to the level of the marker in an untreated individual, or to a placebo-treated individual. Those skilled in the art can readily measure such serum markers of liver fibrosis, using standard assay methods, many of which are commercially available, and are used routinely in clinical settings. Methods of measuring serum markers include immunological-based methods, e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), radioimmunoassays, and the like, using antibody specific for a given serum marker.\n\n\n[0259] Quantitative tests of functional liver reserve can also be used to assess the efficacy of treatment with an interferon receptor agonist and pirfenidone (or a pirfenidone analog). These include: indocyanine green clearance (ICG), galactose elimination capacity (GEC), aminopyrine breath test (ABT), antipyrine clearance, monoethylglycine-xylidide (MEG-X) clearance, and caffeine clearance.\n\n\n[0260] As used herein, a \"complication associated with cirrhosis of the liver\" refers to a disorder that is a sequellae of decompensated liver disease, i.e., or occurs subsequently to and as a result of development of liver fibrosis, and includes, but it not limited to, development of ascites, variceal bleeding, portal hypertension, jaundice, progressive liver insufficiency, encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure requiring liver transplantation, and liver-related mortality.\n\n\n[0261] A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, π, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount that is effective in reducing the incidence (e.g., the likelihood that an individual will develop) of a disorder associated with cirrhosis of the liver by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or more, compared to an untreated individual, or to a placebo-treated individual.\n\n\n[0262] Whether treatment with a compound of Formulae I, II, in, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is effective in reducing the \n\n incidence of a disorder associated with cirrhosis of the liver can readily be determined by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n[0263] Reduction in liver fibrosis increases liver function. Thus, the embodiments provide methods for increasing liver function, generally involving administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, Vπ, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents. Liver functions include, but are not limited to, synthesis of proteins such as serum proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors, alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases (e.g., alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase), 5 '-nucleosidase, γ-glutaminyltranspeptidase, etc.), synthesis of bilirubin, synthesis of cholesterol, and synthesis of bile acids; a liver metabolic function, including, but not limited to, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid and ammonia metabolism, hormone metabolism, and lipid metabolism; detoxification of exogenous drugs; a hemodynamic function, including splanchnic and portal hemodynamics; and the like.\n\n\n[0264] Whether a liver function is increased is readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art, using well-established tests of liver function. Thus, synthesis of markers of liver function such as albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, and the like, can be assessed by measuring the level of these markers in the serum, using standard immunological and enzymatic assays. Splanchnic circulation and portal hemodynamics can be measured by portal wedge pressure and/or resistance using standard methods. Metabolic functions can be measured by measuring the level of ammonia in the serum.\n\n\n[0265] Whether serum proteins normally secreted by the liver are in the normal range can be determined by measuring the levels of such proteins, using standard immunological and enzymatic assays. Those skilled in the art know the normal ranges for such serum proteins. The following are non-limiting examples. The normal level of alanine transaminase is about 45 IU per milliliter of serum. The normal range of aspartate transaminase is from about 5 to about 40 units per liter of serum. Bilirubin is measured using standard assays. Normal bilirubin levels are usually less than about 1.2 mg/dL. Serum albumin levels are measured using standard assays. Normal levels of serum albumin are in the range of from about 35 to about 55 g/L. Prolongation of prothrombin time is measured using standard assays. Normal prothrombin time is less than about 4 seconds longer than control. \n\n [0266] A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is one that is effective to increase liver function by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or more. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VE, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is an amount effective to reduce an elevated level of a serum marker of liver function by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or more, or to reduce the level of the serum marker of liver function to within a normal range. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulae I, E, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents, is also an amount effective to increase a reduced level of a serum marker of liver function by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or more, or to increase the level of the serum marker of liver function to within a normal range.\n\n\nDosages, Formulations, and Routes of Administration\n\n\n[0267] In the subject methods, the active agent(s) (e.g., compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, VE, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agents) may be administered to the host using any convenient means capable of resulting in the desired therapeutic effect. Thus, the agent can be incorporated into a variety of formulations for therapeutic administration. More particularly, the agents of the embodiments can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols.

Compositions are provided in formulation with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). A wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is known in the art and need not be discussed in detail herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients have been amply described in a variety of publications, including, for example, A. Gennaro \n\n (2000) \"Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,\" 20\nth\n edition, Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins; Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (1999) H.C. Ansel et al., eds., 7\nth\n ed., Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (2000) A.H. Kibbe et al., eds., 3\nrd\n ed. Amer.

In some embodiments, the aqueous buffer further includes a non-ionic surfactant such as polysorbate 20 or 80. Optionally the formulations may further include a preservative. Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, a benzyl alcohol, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzalkonium chloride, and the like. In many cases, the formulation is stored at about 4°C. Formulations may also be lyophilized, in which case they generally include cryoprotectants such as sucrose, trehalose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, and the like. Lyophilized formulations can be stored over extended periods of time, even at ambient temperatures.\n\n\n[0271] As such, administration of the agents can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, transdermal, intratracheal, etc., administration. In many embodiments, administration is by bolus injection, e.g., subcutaneous bolus injection, intramuscular bolus injection, and the like.\n\n\n[0272] The pharmaceutical compositions of the embodiments can be administered orally, parenterally or via an implanted reservoir. Oral administration or administration by injection is preferred.\n\n\n[0273] Subcutaneous administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the embodiments is accomplished using standard methods and devices, e.g., needle and syringe, a subcutaneous injection port delivery system, and the like. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,547,119; 4,755,173; 4,531,937; 4,311,137; and 6,017,328. A combination of a \n\n subcutaneous injection port and a device for administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the embodiments to a patient through the port is referred to herein as \"a subcutaneous injection port delivery system.\" In many embodiments, subcutaneous administration is achieved by bolus delivery by needle and syringe.\n\n\n[0274] In pharmaceutical dosage forms, the agents may be administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or they may also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.\n\n\n[0275] For oral preparations, the agents can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.\n\n\n[0276] The agents can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.\n\n\n[0277] Furthermore, the agents can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the embodiments can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.\n\n\n[0278] Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing one or more inhibitors. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the inhibitor(s) in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n [0279] The term \"unit dosage form,\" as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of compounds of the embodiments calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the embodiments depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host.\n\n\n[0280] The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.\n\n\nOther antiviral or antifibrotic agents\n\n\n[0281] As discussed above, a subject method will in some embodiments be carried out by administering an NS3 inhibitor that is a compound of Formulae I, II, IE, IV, V, VI, Vπ, or X, and optionally one or more additional antiviral agent(s).\n\n\n[0282] In some embodiments, the method further includes administration of one or more interferon receptor agonist(s). Interferon receptor agonists are described herein.\n\n\n[0283] In other embodiments, the method further includes administration of pirfenidone or a pirfenidone analog. Pirfenidone and pirfenidone analogs are described herein.\n\n\n[0284] Additional antiviral agents that are suitable for use in combination therapy include, but are not limited to, nucleotide and nucleoside analogs. Non-limiting examples include azidothymidine (AZT) (zidovudine), and analogs and derivatives thereof; 2',3'- dideoxyinosine (DDI) (didanosine), and analogs and derivatives thereof; 2',3'- dideoxycytidine (DDC) (dideoxycytidine), and analogs and derivatives thereof; 2'3,'- didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (D4T) (stavudine), and analogs and derivatives thereof; combivir; abacavir; adefovir dipoxil; cidofovir; ribavirin; ribavirin analogs; and the like.\n\n\n[0285] In some embodiments, the method further includes administration of ribavirin. Ribavirin, l-β-D-ribofuranosyl-lH-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide, available from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., is described in the Merck Index, compound No. 8199, Eleventh Edition. Its manufacture and formulation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,211,771. Some embodiments also involve use of derivatives of ribavirin (see, e.g., U.S. \n\n Pat. No. 6,277,830). The ribavirin may be administered orally in capsule or tablet form, or in the same or different administration form and in the same or different route as the NS-3 inhibitor compound. Of course, other types of administration of both medicaments, as they become available are contemplated, such as by nasal spray, transdermally, intravenously, by suppository, by sustained release dosage form, etc. Any form of administration will work so long as the proper dosages are delivered without destroying the active ingredient.\n\n\n[0286] In some embodiments, the method further includes administration of ritonavir. Ritonavir, 10-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-(l-methylethyl)-1-[2-(l-methylethyl)-4- thiazolyl]-3,6-dioxo-8,l l-bis(phenylmethyl)-2,4,7,12-tetraazatridecan-13-oic acid, 5- thiazolylmethyl ester [5S-(5R*,8R*,l0R*,llR*)], available from Abbott Laboratories, is an inhibitor of the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus and also of the cytochrome P450 3A and P450 2D6 liver enzymes frequently involved in hepatic metabolism of therapeutic molecules in man. Because of its strong inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 3A and the inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 2D6, ritonavir at doses below the normal therapeutic dosage may be combined with other protease inhibitors to achieve therapeutic levels of the second protease inhibitor while reducing the number of dosage units required, the dosing frequency, or both.\n\n\n[0287] Coadministration of low-dose ritonavir may also be used to compensate for drug interactions that tend to decrease levels of a protease inhibitor metabolized by CYP3A. Its structure, synthesis, manufacture and formulation are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,206 U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,523 U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,497 U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,987 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,333. The ritonavir may be administered orally in capsule or tablet or oral solution form, or in the same or different administration form and in the same or different route as the NS-3 inhibitor compound. Of course, other types of administration of both medicaments, as they become available are contemplated, such as by nasal spray, transdermally, intravenously, by suppository, by sustained release dosage form, etc. Any form of administration will work so long as the proper dosages are delivered without destroying the active ingredient.\n\n\n[0288] In some embodiments, an additional antiviral agent is administered during the entire course of NS3 inhibitor compound treatment. In other embodiments, an additional antiviral agent is administered for a period of time that is overlapping with that of the NS3 inhibitor compound treatment, e.g., the additional antiviral agent treatment can begin before the NS 3 inhibitor compound treatment begins and end before the NS 3 inhibitor compound treatment ends; the additional antiviral agent treatment can begin after the NS 3 inhibitor \n\n compound treatment begins and end after the NS 3 inhibitor compound treatment ends; the additional antiviral agent treatment can begin after the NS3 inhibitor compound treatment begins and end before the NS 3 inhibitor compound treatment ends; or the additional antiviral agent treatment can begin before the NS 3 inhibitor compound treatment begins and end after the NS 3 inhibitor compound treatment ends.\n\n\nMethods of Treatment Monotherapies\n\n\n[0289] The NS3 inhibitor compounds described herein may be used in acute or chronic therapy for HCV disease.

In other embodiments, any of the above-described methods may be practiced in which the desired dosage of PEGylated IFN-α (PEG-IFN-α) is administered subcutaneously to the patient by bolus delivery qw, qow, three times per month, or monthly for the desired treatment duration. \n\n [0315] In other embodiments, an NS3 inhibitor compound and a Type II interferon receptor agonist are co-administered in the treatment methods of the embodiments. Type II interferon receptor agonists suitable for use herein include any interferon-γ (IFN-γ).\n\n\n[0316] Effective dosages of IFN-γ can range from about 0.5 μg/m\n2\n to about 500 μg/m\n2\n, usually from about 1.5 μg/m\n2\n to 200 μg/m\n2\n, depending on the size of the patient. This activity is based on 10 international units (U) per 50 μg of protein. IFN-γ can be administered daily, every other day, three times a week, or substantially continuously or continuously.\n\n\n[0317] In specific embodiments of interest, IFN-γ is administered to an individual in a unit dosage form of from about 25 μg to about 500 μg, from about 50 μg to about 400 μg, or from about 100 μg to about 300 μg. In particular embodiments of interest, the dose is about 200 μg IFN-γ. In many embodiments of interest, IFN-γlb is administered.\n\n\n[0318] Where the dosage is 200 μg IFN-γ per dose, the amount of IFN-γ per body weight (assuming a range of body weights of from about 45 kg to about 135 kg) is in the range of from about 4.4 μg IFN-γ per kg body weight to about 1.48 μg IFN-γ per kg body weight.\n\n\n[0319] The body surface area of subject individuals generally ranges from about 1.33 m\n2\n to about 2.50 m\n2\n. Thus, in many embodiments, an IFN-γ dosage ranges from about 150 μg/m\n2\n to about 20 μg/m\n2\n. For example, an IFN-γ dosage ranges from about 20 μg/m\n2\n to about 30 μg/m , from about 30 μg/m to about 40 μg/m , from about 40 μg/m to about 50 μg/m\n2\n, from about 50 μg/m\n2\n to about 60 μg/m\n2\n, from about 60 μg/m\n2\n to about 70 μg/m\n2\n, from about 70 μg/m to about 80 μg/m , from about 80 μg/m to about 90 μg/m , from about 90 μg/m\n2\n to about 100 μg/m\n2\n, from about 100 μg/m\n2\n to about 110 μg/m\n2\n, from about 110 μg/m\n2\n to about 120 μg/m\n2\n, from about 120 μg/m\n2\n to about 130 μg/m\n2\n, from about 130 μg/m\n2\n to about 140 μg/m\n2\n, or from about 140 μg/m\n2\n to about 150 μg/m\n2\n. In some embodiments, the dosage groups range from about 25 μg/m\n2\n to about 100 μg/m\n2\n. In other embodiments, the dosage groups range from about 25 μg/m\n2\n to about 50 μg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n[0320] In some embodiments, a Type I or a Type IE interferon receptor agonist is administered in a first dosing regimen, followed by a second dosing regimen. The first dosing regimen of Type I or a Type El interferon receptor agonist (also referred to as \"the induction regimen\") generally involves administration of a higher dosage of the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist. For example, in the case of Infergen® consensus IFN-α \n\n (CIFN), the first dosing regimen comprises administering CIFN at about 9 μg, about 15 μg, about 18 μg, or about 27 μg. The first dosing regimen can encompass a single dosing event, or at least two or more dosing events. The first dosing regimen of the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist can be administered daily, every other day, three times a week, every other week, three times per month, once monthly, substantially continuously or continuously.\n\n\n[0321] The first dosing regimen of the Type I or Type III interferon receptor agonist is administered for a first period of time, which time period can be at least about 4 weeks, at least about 8 weeks, or at least about 12 weeks.\n\n\n[0322] The second dosing regimen of the Type I or Type El interferon receptor agonist (also referred to as \"the maintenance dose\") generally involves administration of a lower amount of the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist. For example, in the case of CIFN, the second dosing regimen comprises administering CE\n7\nN at a dose of at least about 3 μg, at least about 9 μg, at least about 15 μg, or at least about 18 μg. The second dosing regimen can encompass a single dosing event, or at least two or more dosing events.\n\n\n[0323] The second dosing regimen of the Type I or Type EI interferon receptor agonist can be administered daily, every other day, three times a week, every other week, three times per month, once monthly, substantially continuously or continuously.\n\n\n[0324] In some embodiments, where an \"induction'V'maintenance\" dosing regimen of a Type I or a Type EI interferon receptor agonist is administered, a \"priming\" dose of a Type E interferon receptor agonist (e.g., IFN-γ) is included. In these embodiments, IFN- γ is administered for a period of time from about 1 day to about 14 days, from about 2 days to about 10 days, or from about 3 days to about 7 days, before the beginning of treatment with the Type I or Type EI interferon receptor agonist. This period of time is referred to as the \"priming\" phase.\n\n\n[0325] In some of these embodiments, the Type II interferon receptor agonist treatment is continued throughout the entire period of treatment with the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist. In other embodiments, the Type II interferon receptor agonist treatment is discontinued before the end of treatment with the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist. In these embodiments, the total time of treatment with Type II interferon receptor agonist (including the \"priming\" phase) is from about 2 days to about 30 days, from about 4 days to about 25 days, from about 8 days to about 20 days, from about 10 days to \n\n about 18 days, or from about 12 days to about 16 days. In still other embodiments, the Type π interferon receptor agonist treatment is discontinued once Type I or a Type El interferon receptor agonist treatment begins.\n\n\n[0326] In other embodiments, the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist is administered in single dosing regimen. For example, in the case of CE\n7\nN, the dose of CIFN is generally in a range of from about 3 μg to about 15 μg, or from about 9 μg to about 15 μg. The dose of Type I or a Type EI interferon receptor agonist is generally administered daily, every other day, three times a week, every other week, three times per month, once monthly, or substantially continuously. The dose of the Type I or Type III interferon receptor agonist is administered for a period of time, which period can be, for example, from at least about 24 weeks to at least about 48 weeks, or longer.\n\n\n[0327] In some embodiments, where a single dosing regimen of a Type I or a Type EI interferon receptor agonist is administered, a \"priming\" dose of a Type E interferon receptor agonist (e.g., IFN-γ) is included. In these embodiments, IFN-γ is administered for a period of time from about 1 day to about 14 days, from about 2 days to about 10 days, or from about 3 days to about 7 days, before the beginning of treatment with the Type I or Type IE interferon receptor agonist. This period of time is referred to as the \"priming\" phase. In some of these embodiments, the Type II interferon receptor agonist treatment is continued throughout the entire period of treatment with the Type I or Type III interferon receptor agonist. In other embodiments, the Type II interferon receptor agonist treatment is discontinued before the end of treatment with the Type I or Type III interferon receptor agonist. In these embodiments, the total time of treatment with the Type E interferon receptor agonist (including the \"priming\" phase) is from about 2 days to about 30 days, from about 4 days to about 25 days, from about 8 days to about 20 days, from about 10 days to about 18 days, or from about 12 days to about 16 days.

Individuals who are infected with HCV are identified as having HCV RNA in their blood, and/or having anti-HCV antibody in their serum. Such individuals include anti-HCV ELISA-positive individuals, and individuals with a positive recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Such individuals may also, but need not, have elevated serum ALT levels.\n\n\n[0502] Individuals who are clinically diagnosed as infected with HCV include naϊve individuals (e.g., individuals not previously treated for HCV, particularly those who have not previously received IFN-α-based and/or ribavirin-based therapy) and individuals who have failed prior treatment for HCV (\"treatment failure\" patients). Treatment failure patients include non-responders (i.e., individuals in whom the HCV titer was not significantly or sufficiently reduced by a previous treatment for HCV, e.g., a previous IFN-α monotherapy, a previous IFN-α and ribavirin combination therapy, or a previous pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin combination therapy); and relapsers (i.e., individuals who were previously treated for HCV, e.g., who received a previous IFN-α monotherapy, a previous IFN-α and ribavirin combination therapy, or a previous pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin combination therapy, whose HCV titer decreased, and subsequently increased).\n\n\n[0503] In particular embodiments of interest, individuals have an HCV titer of at least about 10\n5\n, at least about 5 x 10\n5\n, or at least about 10\n6\n, or at least about 2 x 10\n6\n, genome copies of HCV per milliliter of serum. The patient may be infected with any HCV genotype (genotype 1, including Ia and Ib, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc. and subtypes (e.g., 2a, 2b, 3a, etc.)), \n\n particularly a difficult to treat genotype such as HCV genotype 1 and particular HCV subtypes and quasispecies.\n\n\n[0504] Also of interest are HCV-positive individuals (as described above) who exhibit severe fibrosis or early cirrhosis (non-decompensated, Child' s-Pugh class A or less), or more advanced cirrhosis (decompensated, Child' s-Pugh class B or C) due to chronic HCV infection and who are viremic despite prior anti- viral treatment with IFN-α-based therapies or who cannot tolerate IFN-α-based therapies, or who have a contraindication to such therapies. In particular embodiments of interest, HCV-positive individuals with stage 3 or 4 liver fibrosis according to the METAVIR scoring system are suitable for treatment with the methods described herein. In other embodiments, individuals suitable for treatment with the methods of the embodiments are patients with decompensated cirrhosis with clinical manifestations, including patients with far-advanced liver cirrhosis, including those awaiting liver transplantation. In still other embodiments, individuals suitable for treatment with the methods described herein include patients with milder degrees of fibrosis including those with early fibrosis (stages 1 and 2 in the METAVIR, Ludwig, and Scheuer scoring systems; or stages 1, 2, or 3 in the Ishak scoring system.).\n\n\nPreparation of NS3 Inhibitors METHODOLOGY\n\n\n[0505] The HCV protease inhibitors in the following sections can be prepared according to the procedures and schemes shown in each section. The numberings in each of the following Preparation of NS3 Inhibitor sections including the General Method or General Procedure designations, are meant for that specific section only, and should not be construed or confused with the same numberings, if any, in other sections. \n\n\n\n\nPREPARATION OF NS3 INHIBITORS: SECTION I Example 1 General Synthesis A Scheme I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0506] Macrocyclics of general structures I-D and I-E can be synthesized as shown in Scheme I. The isoindoline carbamate 1 can be treated under basic conditions to hydrolyse the isoindoline carbamate thereby providing alcohol 2. The alcohol 2 can be treated with a heteroaryl chloride, such as 2-chlorobenzothiazole, 2-chloro-6- methylbenzothiazole, 2,6-dichlorobenzothiazole, 6-bromo-2-chlorobenzothiazole,\n\n\n1-chloroisoquinoline and the like, under basic conditions to afford a compound of general structure I-A. The compound of general structure I-A can be treated with acid in methanol to remove the Boc protecting group and form a methyl ester thereby providing a compound of general structure I-B. The compound of general structure I-B can be treated with optionally substituted aryl boronic acids under Cu\n2+\n-catalyzed conditions thereby providing N-aryl \n\n compounds of general structure I-C. The compounds of general structure I-C can be treated under basic conditions to hydrolyse the methyl ester thereby providing carboxylic acids of general structure I-D. Finally, acids of general structure I-D can be coupled with sulfonamides (or sulfamides, not shown) thereby providing compounds of general structure I-\n\n\nE.\n\n\nExample 1-1:\n\n\nGeneral Procedure A\n\n\n[0507] Compound l ( 10 g, 15.9 mmol.) was dissolved in methanol (100 mL), 5\n\n\nM NaOH solution (95 mL) was added , the resulting mixture was heated to 50 °C and stirred overnight, after completion of the reaction. The mixture was cooled by ice water, 2 M HCl was added to acidify the mixture to pH=3-4, then the mixture was extracted by EtOAc, the organic layers were combined, washed by brine, dried, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the crude compound 2 (7.5 g) was used directly in the next step.\n\n\nExample 1-2:\n\n\nGeneral Procedure B\n\n\n[0508] A solution of Compound 2 (5 g, 1 mL/100 mg) in DMF was added slowly to a mixture of NaH was dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL/100 mg NaH), cooled to 0-5 °C. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 0-5 °C, then heteroaryl halide (2c) was added, the resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 12 h. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C (ice water bath), then 2 M HCl was carefully added to lower the pH (pH=3-4). The acidic mixture was extracted by EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed by brine and dried. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by column chromatography to afford general compound I-A (3.0 g, 60-70% yield).\n\n\nExample 1-3:\n\n\nGeneral Procedure C\n\n\n[0509] General compound I-A (3.0 g) was dissolved in HCl in MeOH (25 niL/g, compound I-A), the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h.

(2SAR)- l-(tert-Butoxycarbonylamino)-4-hydroxy-proline can be treated with a heteroaryl chloride, such as 2-phenyl-4-chloro-7-methoxy-quinoline, 1-chloro-isoquinoline and the like, under basic conditions, for example potassium tert-butoxide in DMSO, to provide heteroaryl ethers, such as (2S,4R)- l-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-4-(l-isoquinolin-1- oxy)-proline. The heteroaryl ethers, such as (2S,4R)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-4-(l- isoquinolin-1-oxy)-proline, can be coupled with amino acylsulfonamides, such as (\\R,2R)-\\- Amino-2-vinyl-cyclopropane-1-acyl-(l'-methyl)cyclopropanesulfonamide, using a coupling agent, for example using HATU in DMF in the presence of DIPEA, to provide dipeptides such as compound 22. Compound 22 can be treated under acidic conditions, for example HCl in dioxane, to remove the Boc protecting group thereby forming free amines, such as compound 23. Free amines, such as compound 23, can be coupled with N-aryl amino acids, such as 2-(3-trifluoromethyl-5-fluoro-phenylamino)-non-8-enoic acid, using a coupling agent, for example using HATU in DMF in the presence of DIPEA, to provide macrocyclization precursors, such as compound 24. Finally, the macrocyclization precursors, such as compound 24, can be cyclized in the presence of a catalyst, for example a Zhan catalyst, to provide macrocycles, such as compound 346.\n\n\nExample 19-25: \n\n General Procedure KK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0684] Preparation of (25,4R)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-4-(l-isoquinolin- 1-oxy) -proline:\n\n\n[0685] (2S,4R)-1-(tert-Butoxycarbonylamino)-4-hydroxy-proline (1.00 g, 4.64 mmol., 1.0 eq.) and dimethylsulfoxide (40 mL) were charged into a 100 mL round bottom flask.

The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour at ambient temperature while the colour changed from pale yellow to dark orange. 2-(4-isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-4- chloro-7-methoxy-8-methyl-quinoline (35.00 g, 105 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added portionwise leading to the formation of a brown sticky residue. Further dimethylsulf oxide (150 mL) was added to help solubilizing the reagents and the stirring was continued at 35 °C for a further 20 min. As the reaction mixture remained very thick more dimethylsulf oxide (300 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 28 °C for 15 hours by which time LCMS analysis of the reaction mixture showed the reaction to be complete. The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (300 mL) and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was left to cool to ambient temperature and split into two portions to ease the work up. Both fractions were treated in the same way as follows. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (500 mL) and water (300 mL). The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 3 with IM hydrochloric acid (~ 80 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 200 mL). The organic extracts were combined, washed with water (5 x 350 mL) and brine (300 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed under vacuum to give 24 g and 25 g of crude product respectively. Each solid was purified separately by dry flash chromatography onto 500 g of silica and eluting with a dichloromethane: methanol gradient (from neat dichloromethane to 5% methanol in dichloromethane). After combining the relevant fractions and solvent removal 20.6 g (37%) and 21.7 g (39%) of the desired product were isolated as a yellow solid.

The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour at ambient temperature while the color changed from pale yellow to dark orange. 2-(4-isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-4- chloro-7-methoxy-8-methyl-quinoline (35.00 g, 105 mmol., 1.0 eq.) was added portionwise leading to the formation of a brown sticky residue. Further dimethylsulfoxide (150 mL) was added to help solubilizing the reagents and the stirring was continued at 35 °C for a further 20 min. As the reaction mixture remained very thick more dimethylsulfoxide (300 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 28 °C for 15 hours by which time LCMS analysis of the reaction mixture showed the reaction to be complete. The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (300 mL) and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was left to cool to ambient temperature and split into two portions to ease the work up. Both fractions were treated in the same way as follows. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (500 mL) and \n\n water (300 mL). The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 3 with IM hydrochloric acid (~ 80 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 200 mL). The organic extracts were combined, washed with water (5 x 350 mL) and brine (300 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed under vacuum to give 24 g and 25 g of crude product respectively. Each solid was purified separately by dry flash chromatography onto 500 g of silica and eluting with a dichloromethane: methanol gradient (from neat dichloromethane to 5% methanol in dichloromethane). After combining the relevant fractions and solvent removal 20.6 g (37%) and 21.7 g (39%) of the desired product were isolated as a yellow solid. The combined yield was 42.3 g (76%). \n1\nH NMR (500 MHz, CDCl\n3\n) δ ppm 7.89 - 8.03 (m, 1 H), 7.44 - 7.56 (m, 1 H), 7.24 (d, j = 9.16 Hz, 1 H), 7.04 (br. s, 1 H), 5.39 (br. s, 1 H), 4.69 (s, 1 H), 4.47 - 4.60 (m, 1 H), 4.00 (s, 3 H), 3.98 (br. s, 1 H), 3.78 - 3.88 (m, 1 H), 3.18 - 3.25 (m, 1 H), 2.71 (s, 3 H), 1.47 (s, 9 H), 1.42 - 1.45 (m, 1 H), 1.40 (d, j = 6.71 Hz, 6 H), 1.36 - 1.38 (m, 1 H).

Compound 16 was treated under acidic conditions, for example with HCl-dioxane, to generate free amino derivative 17. Next, this compound was arylated with an optionally substituted boronic acids under Cu -\"--catalyzed conditions to yield N-aryl intermediates of general structure XXVIII-A. Simultaneous basic hydrolysis of carbamate and ester functions, for example aqueous sodium hydroxide in ethanol, afforded hydroxy carboxylic acids of general structure XXVIII-B, which were then reacted with a heteroaryl chloride, such as 2-(4- isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-4-chloro-7-methoxy-8-methyl-quinohne and the like, under basic \n\n conditions, for example sodium hydride in DMF, to furnish acids of the general structure XXVIII-C. Finally, these acids were coupled with sulfonamides or sulfamides, for example using CDI in the presence of DBU, to give the target compounds of general structure XXVIII-D.\n\n\nExample 21-1:\n\n\nGeneral ProcedureUU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0809] To a solution of N-Boc compound 16 (13.2 g, 20 mmol.) in DCM (80 niL) was added 4N HCl-dioxane solution (50 mL, 200 mmol.) and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. After evaporation in vacuo the residue was re- dissolved in DCM and the solution was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried over sodium sulfate, evaporated, and dried under high vacuum to afford amino intermediate 17 as off-white foam which was used in the next step without further purification.

The hydroxy carboxylic acids, for example compound 70, can then reacted with a heteroaryl chloride, such as 2-(4-isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-4-chloro-7-methoxy-8-methyl-quinoline and the like, under basic conditions, for example sodium hydride in DMF, to furnish acids, such as compound 448. Finally, these acids can be coupled, for example using CDI in the presence of DBU, with sulfonamides (e.g. cyclopropylsulfonamide) or sulfamides to provide macrocycles such as compound 411. \n\n Example 22-1\n\n\nGeneral Procedure WW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n448 [0818] To a mixture of compound 63 (2.18 g, 3.35 mmol.) and ethanol (20 mL) was added aqueous sodium hydroxide (2N, 10 mL, 20 mmol.) and reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 70°C. Solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in water. The aqueous solution was acidified with 2N hydrochloric acid to pH ~3 and then extracted with ethyl acetate. Organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give crude intermediate 70 as a beige foam (-1.7 g), used on the next step without any further purification.\n\n\n[0819] Crude compound 70 from the previous step (1.7 g) was co-evaporated twice with DMF and then dissolved in anhydrous DMF (10 mL). This solution was cooled down to 0°C and sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 536 mg, 13.4 mmol.) was added in one portion. The reaction was stirred at room temperature until hydrogen evolution subsided (30-40 min), then 4-chloro-2-(4-isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-7-methoxy-8- methylquinoline (1.12 g, 3.35 mmol.) was added to the stirring mixture. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 40°C. After addition of water and 2N hydrochloric acid the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. Organic phase was washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated. The desired acid (448) was isolated by flash chromatography in 2-4% methanol in DCM to afford 1.88 g (74% over two steps), pale yellow foam. . \n1\nH-NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n), δ: 12.3 (br. s, 1 H), 8.68 (s, 1 H), 7.88 (d, 1 H), 7.58 (s, 1 H), 7.48 (s, 1 H), 6.68 (dd, 1 H), 6.44 (d, 1 H), 6.33 (d, 1 H), 6.21 (dd, 1 H), 5.88 (d, 1 H), 5.73 (m, 1 H), 5.52 (m, 1 H), 5.33 dd, 1 H), 4.51 (dd, 1 H), 4.34-4.40 (m, 2 H), 3.98-4.05 (m, \n\n 1 H), 3.95 (s, 3 H), 3.17 (m, 1 H), 2.49 (m, 1 H), 2.59 (s, 3 H), 2.43 (m, 1 H), 2.15 (dd, 1 H), 1.99 (m, 1 H), 1.75 (m, 1 H), 1.65 (m, 1 H), 1.15-1.49 (m, 13 H).\n\n\nExample 22-2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\n[0820] Compound 449 was prepared in a manner analogous to General Procedure\n\n\nWW, and the yield is 58.5% (two steps).

Most of the treatment-naϊve patients were male (80%) and European (90%). Median BMI ranged from 23.6 kg/m\n2\n to 26.9 kg/m\n2\n, with an overall range of 19 kg/m\n2\n to 31 kg/m\n2\n. The median duration since HCV diagnosis ranged from 2 years to 7.5 years, with an overall range of 1 year to 34 years. Median HCV RNA log\n10\n levels ranged from 5.73 log\n10\n IU/mL to 6.46 log\n10\n IU/mL. Median ALT levels ranged from 56 U/L to 74 U/L with an overall range of 26 U/L to 241 U/L.\n\n\nPart B (NR Patients):\n\n\n[1143] Overall age ranged from 25 years to 62 years. Of the 10 NR patients, 8 were male (ITMN-191), 2 were female (placebo), and 100% were European. Median BMI ranged from 23.5 kg/m\n2\n to 25.1 kg/m\n2\n, with an overall range of 19 kg/m\n2\n to 30 kg/m\n2\n. The median duration since HCV diagnosis ranged from 1 year to 9.5 years, with an overall range of 1 to 16 years. Median HCV RNA levels ranged from 6.47 log\n10\n IU/mL to 6.64 log\n10\n IU/mL, with an overall range of 5.98 logio IU/mL to 7.63 logio IU/mL. Median ALT levels ranged from 62.5 U/L to 75.5 U/L, with an overall range of 26 U/L to 152 U/L.\n\n\nPatient Disposition\n\n\n[1144] All patients completed 14 days of treatment (40 on ITMN-191 and 10 on placebo). During the 14-day dosing period, 3 treatment-naϊve patients in the 200 mg ql2h treatment arm received less than the assigned daily dose of blinded study drug dose (2 patients received 100 mg ql2h of ITMN-191 during the entire 14 days, and 1 patient received 100 mg ql2h of ITMN-191 during Day 1 through the first dose of Day 5 of the dosing period). Of the 50 enrolled patients, 49 completed through Day 44 (1 patient was lost to follow-up after Day 21), and 48 patients completed through Day 90. Among treatment-naϊve patients, 31/40 initiated optional SOC treatment on Day 15, and among NR patients, 7/10 initiated optional SOC treatment on Day 44. \n\n [1145] Efficacy was evaluated by logio reductions in HCV RNA levels and reductions in ALT values using the Efficacy-Evaluable Population, defined as those patients who received at least 90% of prescribed doses of assigned blinded study drug. Three patients in the treatment-naive 200 mg ql2h cohort received less than the assigned randomized dose and were excluded from all efficacy analyses. The HCV RNA levels were determained by Roche COBAS Taqman HCV/HPS test, v2.0. This is a reverse transcriptase PCR method.\n\n\nViral Kinetics (VK)\n\n\nPart A (Treatment-Naive Patients)\n\n\n[1146] In the treatment-naϊve patients, ITMN- 191 treatment resulted in generally rapid, sustained (over the 14-day treatment period), dose-dependent reductions in HCV RNA levels, with median reductions of -3.12 log\n10\n IU/mL in the 200 mg ql2h cohort and -3.76 logio IU/mL for the 200 mg q8h cohort at end of treatment (EOT) (Day 14). Similarly, median maximum reductions in HCV RNA levels in the 200 mg ql2h and 200 mg q8h cohorts were -3.17 log\n10\n IU/mL and -3.90-log\n10\n IU/mL, respectively. Median ALT values declined from elevated Baseline levels in all ITMN-191 cohorts during study treatment, with the largest median EOT reduction of -37.5 U/L observed in the 200 mg q8h cohort.\n\n\nPart B (NR Patients)\n\n\n[1147] In the NR patients, 300 mg q8h of ITMN-191 treatment resulted in a median reduction of -2.46 logio IU/mL at EOT. The median maximum reduction in HCV RNA levels was -2.93 log\n10\n IU/mL. The median ALT value declined from an elevated Baseline level by -34.5 U/L at EOT.\n\n\nViral Resistance\n\n\n[1148] In Parts A and B, rebound, plateau, and continuous decline of virologic response profiles were defined based on the HCV RNA level at end of treatment (EOT) relative to the nadir HCV RNA level. In general, patients experiencing virologic rebound (14/40 patients) and plateau (12/40 patients) were observed in the lower dose treatment arms, while the majority of patients (14/40 patients) experiencing a continual decline in HCV RNA level were observed in the upper dose treatment arms. The frequency of rebound for treatment-naϊve patients (Part A) was higher in the 100 mg q2h treatment arm (4 patients) than in the higher dose treatment arms (2 to 3 patients). The frequency of rebound for NR \n\n patients (Part B) was the same (2 patients) as for the treatment-naϊve patients in the 100 mg q8h treatment arm. However, there were no statistically significant differences in ITMN-191 AUC, C\nmax\n, or C\nτ\n between rebound, plateau, and continual decline groups. At EOT, every patient classified as experiencing virologic rebound carried NS3 variants in which arginine at amino acid position 155 was replaced, at least in part, by lysine. Arginine substitution was observed 21 and 90 days following cessation of ITMN-191 administration in the majority of patients with amplifiable NS3 at those time points, indicating that NS3 bearing this substitution were genetically fit.\n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n[1149] ITMN-191 treatment provides a dose-dependent reduction in HCV RNA levels in treatment-naϊve patients, with a daily dose of 200 mg q8h for 14 days providing the highest median reduction of HCV RNA levels of all the treatment arms. In the treatment- naϊve cohorts (Part A) the median maximum post-Baseline log\n10\n reduction in HCV RNA in the 200 mg ql2h and the 200 mg q8h cohorts are -3.17 log\n10\n IU/mL and -3.90 log\n10\n IU/mL, respectively during study drug treatment. In the single NR cohort (Part B), the 300 mg ql2h dose results in a more modest median maximum post-Baseline change in HCV RNA of - 2.93 logio IU/mL during study drug treatment. Virologic rebound occurred in 14 (35%) of the 40 ITMN-191 treated patients and was primarily associated with an R155K substitution in the NS3 protein coding sequence at end of treatment. ITMN-191 administration resulted in reductions in elevated Baseline ALT levels during 14 days of treatment in all cohorts.\n\n\nTable 4: Viral Kinetic Assessments of Monotherapy Following 14 Days of Treatment.\n\n\n \n\n [1150] The data in Table 4 demonstates in Group 2 (100 mg q8h) and Group 3 (200 mg q8h) that 13% of the patients in each group had HCV RNA lowered to levels below 43 IU/mL.\n\n\nExample 62-2 - ITMN-191 Treatment Effect on HCV viral load - Combination therapy\n\n\nStudy Design:\n\n\n[1151] This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in treatment- naϊve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. All patients receive standard of care (SOC) treatment with PEG-IFN alfa-2a and weight-based ribavirin in accordance with the product labeling. In addition to this standard of care treatment, patients are randomized to receive either ITMN-191 or matching placebo, administered in the fed state, for 14 complete days, and a single dose on Day 15. PEG-IFN alfa-2a and ribavirin is provided from Day 0 and following the completion of study drug treatment on Day 15 through Day 44. No other HCV therapies are permitted prior to Day 44. All patients receive SOC and then are administered a pill containing either ITMN-191 or placebo. The ITMN-191 was administered in the form of its sodium salt.\n\n\n[1152] Patients are admitted to a research facility and initiate PEG-IFN alfa-2a and ribavirin on Day 0. Study drug (ITMN-191 or placebo) administration begins on Day 1 and continues to the morning of Day 15, and patients are discharged from the research facility on Day 16. Meals and activity levels are standardized across research facilities. Patients are contacted by telephone on Day 21 and return to the research facility for the Safety Follow-up Visit on Day 28 and the End of Study Visit on Day 44.\n\n\n[1153] The initial ITMN-191 dose levels administered in this study resulted in exposures generally similar to those studied a completed multiple ascending dose study of ITMN-191 monotherapy (see Comparative Example 21-1 above).\n\n\n[1154] Over the course of the study, blood samples are obtained for clinical laboratory analysis and for PK (pharmokinetics) and VK (viral kinetics). In addition, blood samples to assess VR (viral rebound) are obtained. To monitor potential cardiac toxicity, cardiac troponin are assessed every day during the treatment period. Methods:\n\n\n[1155] End of treatment (EOT) and nadir HCV RNA levels were used to define virologic rebound, continual decline, and plateau response patterns. NS 3 protease domain was amplified and population sequenced by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction \n\n (RT-PCR). Amplicons were cloned into a novel NS3 phenotyping vector and this plasmid used for clonal sequencing. The HCV RNA levels were determained by Roche COBAS Taqman HCV/HPS test, v2.0. This is a reverse transcriptase PCR method. Results:\n\n\n[1156] After 14 days of triple combination therapy, the median change in HCV RNA from baseline exceeded 5 logs in five of the six cohorts and was -5.5 log and -5.7 log in the best performing ql2h and q8h cohorts, respectively. At the end of only 14 days of treatment, HCV RNA was below the limit of quantification (<25 IU/mL) in nearly three- quarters (71%, or 32 of 45) of patients at all doses and intervals who received treatment with ITMN-191 as summarized in Table 5. In all ql2h and q8h cohorts of ITMN- 191 in combination with SOC, reductions in HCV RNA occurred rapidly and there was no evidence of the viral rebound seen during during ITMN-191 monotherapy treatment (see Comparative Example 62-1 above).\n\n\nTable 5: Viral Kinetic Assessments of Combination Therapy Following 14 Days of Treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1157] The combination of ITMN-191 with SOC provides a much greater reduction in HCV RNA levels as compared to SOC alone, as evidenced by the median change of HCV RNA levels shown in Table 5. Further, the combination protocol prevents a viral rebound in all treatment groups, in contrast to patients treated with ITMN-191 alone where \n\n viral rebound was observed. This extraordinary and rapid reduction in HCV RNA was not seen in patients under SOC and placebo treatment. It was observed that at least 57% of the patients treated with the combination therapy obtained HCV RNA levels below 25 IU/mL. Further, it was observed that at least 13% of the patients treated with the combination therapy obtained HCV RNA levels below 9.3 IU/mL (detection limit of analysis method). Additionally, there was no viral rebound observed for any patients in the combination treatment groups.\n\n\n[1158] Various trends are observed by comparing the earlier ITMN-191 monotherapy study (see Example 62-1) with the more recent combination study, as summarized in Table 5. The combination treatment provides (group 4 and group 6, Table 6) reduction of HCV RNA levels below 43 IU/mL in a significant percentage of the patients in each study group. This reduction is observed in the combination study where 100 mg of ITMN-191 was administered every 8 hours or 200 mg of ITMN-191 was administered every 8 hours. The baseline comparison can be seen in the placebo group (placebo alone) and the SOC treatment group (placebo with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin) which did not show any patients with an HCV RNA level below 43 IU/mL after 14 days of treatment.\n\n\n[1159] The superior virologic response of the combination therapy is evident by comparing the monotherapy cohorts to their corresponding combination therapy cohorts. The monotherapy cohort (group 3) where 100 mg of ITMN-191 was administered every 8 hours provided a reduction of HCV RNA levels below 43 IU/mL in 13% of patients after 14 days of treatment. In contrast, the corresponding cohort from the combination study where 100 mg of ITMN-191 was administered every 8 hours in combination with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin provided a reduction of HCV RNA levels below 43 IU/mL in 75% of patients (group 4) after 14 days of treatment. The cohort from the monotherapy study where the amount of ITMN-191 was increased to 200 mg, again administered every 8 hours, provided a similar reduction of HCV RNA levels below 43 IU/mL in 13% of patients (group 5) after 14 days of treatment. Similar to the previous comparison, the corresponding cohort (group 6) where 200 mg of ITMN-191 was administered every 8 hours in combination with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin provided a reduction of HCV RNA levels below 43 IU/mL in 88% of patients after 14 days of treatment. Thus, the combination cohorts provide a superior reduction in HCV RNA levels in comparison to the monotherapy cohorts, as evidenced by the much greater percentage of patients with a reduction of HCV RNA levels in the blood. \n\n Table 6: Comparison of Viral Kinetic Assessments Among Placebo, SOC, ITMN-191 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Following 14 Days of Treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n[1160] The combination of ITMN-191 with SOC provides, on average, reduction of HCV RNA in all patient cohorts that is greater than SOC alone. The reduction of HCV RNA is observed without viral rebound.\n\n\n[1161] While the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process step or steps, to the objective, spirit and scope of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims appended hereto."

Description\n\n\n\n\n METHOD OF PROCESSING MICROPARTICLES\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to microparticles, compositions and formulations containing microparticles, and more specifically, to methods for processing such compositions and formulations.\n\n\nDescription of Related Technology\n\n\nMicroparticles, microspheres, and microcapsules, referred to herein collectively as \"microparticles,\" are solid or semi-solid particles having a diameter of less than one millimeter, more preferably less than 100 microns, which can be formed of a variety of materials, including but not limited to various polymers and proteins. Microparticles have been used in many different applications, primarily separations, diagnostics, and drug delivery.\n\n\nThe most well known examples of microparticles used in separations techniques are those which are formed of polymers of either synthetic or protein origin, such as polyacrylamide, hydroxyapatite, or agarose. These polymeric microparticles are commonly used to separate molecules such as proteins based on molecular weight and/or ionic charge, or by interaction with molecules chemically coupled to the microparticles.\n\n\nIn the diagnostic area, spherical beads or particles have been commercially available as a tool for biochemists for many years. For example, microparticles have been derivatized with an enzyme, a substrate for an enzyme, or a labeled antibody, and then interacted with a molecule to be detected, either directly or indirectly. A number of derivatized beads are commercially available with various constituents and sizes. In the controlled drug delivery area, molecules have been encapsulated within microparticles or incorporated into a matrix to provide controlled release of the \n\n molecules. A number of different techniques have been used to make such microparticles from various polymers including phase separation, solvent evaporation, emulsifϊcation, and spray drying. Generally, the polymers form the supporting structure of the microparticles, and the drug or molecule of interest is incorporated into the supporting structure. Exemplary polymers used for the formation of microparticles include homopolymers and copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid (PLGA), block copolymers, and polyphosphazenes.\n\n\nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0170005 (the '005 publication) discloses phase separation methods for forming microparticles involving dissolving an active agent in an aqueous and/or aqueous-miscible solvent(s) containing a dissolved phase-separation enhancing agent(s) to form a solution in a single liquid phase. The solution is then subjected to a liquid-solid phase separation to cause the active agent to form solid spherical small particles (i.e., the solid phase) while the phase-separation enhancing agent(s) and solvent(s) comprise the liquid phase. The '005 publication discloses methods of harvesting microparticles including washing solutions comprising microparticles and/or concentrated microparticles with liquid media in which the active agent is insoluble and the undesired phase-separation enhancing agent is soluble. Disclosed liquid media include organic solvents and supercritical fluids. Representative washing methods include diafϊltration and centrifugation. The remaining liquid phases are then typically removed by lyophilization or evaporation.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the methods for processing multi-phasic dispersions involve providing a multi-phasic dispersion including dispersed and continuous phases, the dispersion comprising solid microparticles and at least one of a non-volatile material and a solvent, positioning the multi-phasic dispersion within a chamber capable of being pressurized, pressurizing the chamber with a first gas to a pressure greater than 10 bar but less than the supercritical pressure of the gas, and contacting the multi-phasic dispersion with the first gas, thereby separating at least a portion of the non- volatile material and/or the solvent from the dispersion. \n\n In an additional embodiment, the methods for processing multi-phasic dispersions comprise providing a multi-phasic dispersion including dispersed and continuous phases, the dispersion comprising solid microparticles and at least one of a non-volatile material and a solvent, positioning the multi-phasic dispersion within an extraction basket, positioning the extraction basket within a chamber capable of being pressurized, pressurizing the chamber with a first gas to a pressure less than the supercritical pressure of the gas, contacting the multi-phasic dispersion with the first gas, thereby causing at least a portion of the non- volatile material and/or the solvent to flow through the extraction basket, pressurizing the chamber with a second gas to a pressure greater than or equal to the supercritical pressure of the second gas and heating the second gas, thereby providing a supercritical fluid or a sub-critical fluid within the chamber, and contacting the multi-phasic dispersion with the fluid, thereby separating residual non-volatile material and/or solvent from the multi-phasic dispersion to provide microparticles that are substantially free of the non-volatile material and/or the solvent.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the methods for processing multi-phasic dispersions involve spraying a combination of (i) a supercritical fluid or a sub-critical fluid and (ii) a multi-phasic dispersion into an extraction basket of a chamber capable of being pressurized, thereby separating at least a portion of at least one of a non- volatile material and a solvent from solid microparticles, wherein the multi-phasic dispersion includes dispersed and continuous phases and comprises the solid microparticles and at least one of the non- volatile material and the solvent.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION QF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\nExemplary aspects and features in accordance with the disclosure are described and explained in greater detail below with the aid of the sole drawing figure in which:\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a suitable apparatus for carrying out the methods in accordance with the disclosure. \n\n DETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to compositions and formulations containing microp articles and to methods for processing such compositions and formulations. In accordance with the methods, microparticles can be separated from reaction/incubation media so that the microparticles can be collected and/or incorporated into compositions and formulations suitable for drug delivery, diagnostic, separations, and other applications.\n\n\nThe disclosed methods are advantageous for a number of reasons including but not limited to (1) multi-phasic dispersions can be processed so that various components typically contained within the continuous phase are removed while the discontinuous or dispersed phase (e.g., microparticles) is harvested in a single process; (2) organic solvents are not required to remove polymer(s), salt(s), solvent(s), and/or excipient(s) from the microparticles; (3) additional expensive and time-consuming drying steps such as lyophilization and evaporation (e.g., under reduced pressure and elevated temperature) are not necessary to remove residual solvent or lyophilizable solutes from the microparticles; and (4) concentration steps such as centrifugation and diafϊltration can optionally be avoided. Beneficially, the obtained microparticles can be substantially free of residual polymer(s), salt(s), solvent(s), and/or excipient(s) added during microparticle formation. Accordingly, the disclosed methods facilitate production of microparticles comprising substantially 100 wt. % active agent(s) and/or macromolecule carrier(s), which are substantially free of residual polymer(s), salt(s), solvent(s), and/or excipient(s).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the methods for processing multi-phasic dispersions involve providing a multi-phasic dispersion including dispersed and continuous phases, the dispersion comprising solid microparticles and at least one of a non-volatile material and a solvent, positioning the multi-phasic dispersion within a chamber capable of being pressurized, pressurizing the chamber with a first gas to a pressure greater than 10 bar but less than the supercritical pressure of the gas, and contacting the multi-phasic dispersion with the first gas, thereby separating at least a portion of the non-volatile material and/or the solvent from the dispersion. \n\n In an additional embodiment, the methods for processing multi-phasic dispersions comprise providing a multi-phasic dispersion including dispersed and continuous phases, the dispersion comprising solid microparticles and at least one of a non- volatile material and a solvent, positioning the multi-phasic dispersion within an extraction basket, positioning the extraction basket within a chamber capable of being pressurized, pressurizing the chamber with a first gas to a pressure less than the supercritical pressure of the gas, contacting the multi -phasic dispersion with the first gas, thereby causing at least a portion of the non-volatile material and/or the solvent to flow through the extraction basket, pressurizing the chamber with a second gas to a pressure greater than or equal to the supercritical pressure of the second gas and heating the second gas, thereby providing a supercritical fluid or a sub-critical fluid within the chamber, and contacting the multi-phasic dispersion with the fluid, thereby separating residual non-volatile material and/or solvent from the multi-phasic dispersion to provide microparticles that are substantially free of the non-volatile material and/or the solvent.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the methods for processing multi-phasic dispersions involve spraying a combination of (i) a supercritical fluid or a sub-critical fluid and (ii) a multi-phasic dispersion into an extraction basket of a chamber capable of being pressurized, thereby separating at least a portion of at least one of a non- volatile material and a solvent from solid microparticles, wherein the multi-phasic dispersion includes dispersed and continuous phases and comprises the solid microparticles and at least one of the non- volatile material and the solvent.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terminologies employed in the present disclosure shall have the meanings that are commonly understood and used by one of ordinary skill in the art. Unless otherwise required by context, it will be understood that singular terms shall include plural forms of the same and plural terms shall include the singular. Specifically, as used herein and in the claims, the singular forms \"a\" and \"an\" include the plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, the reference to a microparticle is a reference to one such microparticle or a plurality of such microparticles, including equivalents thereof known to one skilled in the art. Also, as \n\n used herein and in the claims, the terms \"at least one\" and \"one or more\" have the same meaning and include one, two, three or more. The following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings when used in the context of the present disclosure. \"Dispersion\" refers to a mixture of matters having at least one dispersed or discontinuous phase (optionally, being finely divided, such as in the form of solid microparticles) present in a solid or non-solid continuous phase (e.g., fluidic, liquid, aqueous, organic, gaseous). Representative examples of dispersions in accordance with the disclosure include solid in solid, solid in liquid, solid in gas, and the like. A dispersion can be substantially homogenous or non-homogenous. A suspension is a particular dispersion in which the dispersed solid phase (such as microparticles) can remain stably suspended (substantially free of sedimentation) in the continuous phase for extended periods of time (for example, at least 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 30 seconds, e.g., minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even one year or more). \"Multi-phasic dispersions\" are dispersions having at least two phases, for example, three or even more phases. In one example, such dispersions may comprise two immiscible fluids (e.g., solvents or solvent systems optionally containing other ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein) in addition to a dispersed phase.\n\n\n\"Microparticle\" refers to a solid particulate (including substantially solid or semi-solid, but excluding gel, liquid and gas) having an average geometric particle size (sometimes referred to as diameter) of less than about 1 mm, for example, less than about 200 microns, less than about 100 microns, less than about 10 microns, less than about 1 micron, less than about 100 ran, less than about 10 nm, greater than about 0.1 nm, greater than about 1 nm, and ranges between these values.

Microparticles for pulmonary delivery have an aerodynamic particle size as determined by time of flight measurements or Andersen Cascade Impactor measurements. Microparticles having a spherical shape are sometimes referred to as microspheres and nanospheres. Microparticles having an encapsulated structure are sometimes referred to as microcapsules and nanocapsules. Microparticles can be porous, for example, having one or more internal voids and/or cavities. Other microparticles are non-porous and/or are free of such voids or cavities. Microparticles are formed from, in part or in whole, one or more materials including but not limited to active agents, carriers, polymers, complexing agents, stabilizing agents, excipients, ions, moisture, residual solvents, impurities, by-products, and/or manufacturing-related compounds. Microparticles can be crystalline, amorphous, microcrystalline, nanocrystalline, or a combination thereof. \"Active agent\" refers to naturally occurring, recombinant, synthetic, or semi-synthetic materials (e.g., compounds, fermentates, extracts, cellular structures) capable of eliciting, directly or indirectly, one or more physical, chemical, and/or biological effects, in vitro and/or in vivo. The active agent can be capable of preventing, alleviating, treating, and/or curing abnormal and/or pathological conditions of a living body, such as by destroying a parasitic organism, or by limiting the effect of a disease or abnormality by materially altering the physiology of the host or parasite. The active agent can be capable of maintaining, increasing, decreasing, \n\n limiting, or destroying a physiological body function. The active agent can be capable of diagnosing a physiological condition or state by an in vitro and/or in vivo test. The active agent can be capable of controlling or protecting an environment or living body by attracting, disabling, inhibiting, killing, modifying, repelling and/or retarding an animal or microorganism.

Active agents can have an isoelectric point of 7.0 or greater, or less than 7.0.\n\n\n\"Proteinaceous compounds\" refer to natural, synthetic, semi-synthetic, or recombinant compounds of or related structurally and/or functionally to proteins, such as those containing or consisting essentially of α-amino acids covalently associated through peptide linkages. Non-limiting proteinaceous compounds include globular proteins (e.g., albumins, globulins, histones), fibrous proteins (e.g., collagens, elastins, keratins), compound proteins (including those containing one or more non-peptide components, e.g., glycoproteins, nucleoproteins, mucoproteins, lipoproteins, metalloproteins), therapeutic proteins, fusion proteins, receptors, antigens (such as synthetic or recombinant antigens), viral surface proteins, hormones and hormone analogs, antibodies (such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies), enzymes, Fab fragments, cyclic peptides, linear peptides, and the like.

Proteinaceous compounds may be neutral, positively charged, negatively charged, or zwitterionic, and may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.\n\n\n\"Nucleic acids\" refer to natural, synthetic, semi-synthetic, or recombinant compounds formed at least in part from two or more of the same or different nucleotides, and may be single-stranded or double-stranded. Non-limiting examples of nucleic acids include oligonucleotides (such as those having 20 or less base pairs, e.g., sense, anti-sense, or missense), aptamers, polynucleotides (e.g., sense, anti-sense, or missense), DNA (e.g., sense, anti-sense, or missense), RNA (e.g., sense, anti-sense, or missense), siRNA, nucleotide acid constructs, single-stranded or double-stranded segments thereof, as well as precursors and derivatives thereof (e.g., glycosylated, hyperglycosylated, PEGylated, FITC-labeled, nucleosides, salts thereof). Nucleic acids may be neutral, positively charged, negatively charged, or zwitterionic, and may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. \"Macromolecule\" refers to a material capable of providing a three- dimensional (e.g., tertiary and/or quaternary) structure, and includes carriers and certain active agents of the present disclosure. Macromolecules typically have a molecular weight of 2 kD or greater, for example, greater than 5kD or from 2kD to 5kD. Non-limiting macromolecules used to form the microparticles include, inter alia, polymers, copolymers, proteins (e.g., enzymes, recombinant proteins, albumins such as human serum albumin, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, \n\n proteinaceous compounds), peptides, lipids, carbohydrates (e.g., monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides), nucleic acids, vectors (e.g., viruses, viral particles), and complexes and conjugates thereof (e.g., covalent and/or non-covalent associations between two macromolecules such as carbohydrate-protein complexes or conjugates, or between an active agent and a macromolecule such as hapten-protein complexes or conjugates). Macromolecules may be neutral, positively charged, negatively charged, or zwitterionic, and may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.\n\n\n\"Carrier\" refers to a compound, typically a macromolecule, having a primary function to provide a three-dimensional structure (including tertiary and/or quaternary structure) to the microspheres. The carrier may be unassociated or associated with the active agent (such as conjugates or complexes thereof) in forming microparticles as described above. The carrier may further provide other functions, such as being an active agent, modifying a release profile of the active agent from the microparticle, and/or imparting one or more particular properties to the microparticle (such as contribute at least in part to the net surface charge). In one example, the carrier is a protein (e.g., an albumin such as human serum albumin) having a molecular weight of 1500 Daltons or greater.\n\n\n\"Polymer\" or \"polymeric\" refers to a natural, recombinant, synthetic, or semi-synthetic molecule having in at least one main chain, branch, or ring structure two or more repeating monomer units.

In one aspect, the terms polymer and polymeric refer to molecules having 10 or more repeating monomer units. Polymers can be linear, branched, block, graft, monodisperse, polydisperse, regular, irregular, tactic, isotactic, syndiotactic, stereoregular, atactic, stereoblock, single-strand, double-strand, star, comb, dendritic, and/or ionomeric, can be ionic or non-ionic, can be neutral, positively charged, negatively charged, or zwitterionic, and can be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. \n\n \"Spherical\" refers to a geometric shape that is at least \"substantially spherical.\" \"Substantially spherical\" means that the ratio of the longest length (i.e., one between two points on the perimeter and passes the geometric center of the shape) to the shortest length on any cross-section that passes through the geometric center is less than about 1.5, such as less than about 1.33, or less than about 1.25. Thus, spherical does not require a line of symmetry. Further, the microparticles can have surface texturing (such as continuous or discrete lines, islands, lattice, indentations, channel openings, protuberances that are small in scale when compared to the overall size of the microparticles) and still be considered spherical. Surface contact between microparticles is minimized when the microparticles are spherical, and thus undesirable agglomeration of the microparticles is typically minimized. In comparison, microparticles that are aspherical crystals or flakes typically display observable agglomeration through ionic and/or non-ionic interactions at relatively large flat surfaces. \"Solid\" refers to a state that includes at least substantially solid and/or semi-solid, but excludes liquid and gas.\n\n\n\"Ambient temperature\" refers to a temperature of around room temperature, typically in a range of about 20\n0\nC to about 40\n0\nC, for example, about 2O\n0\nC to about 25\n0\nC. \"Formed from\" and \"formed of denote open language. As such, it is intended that a composition formed from or formed of a list of recited components be a composition comprising at least these recited components, and can further include other non-recited components during formulation of the composition and/or in the final obtained product. \"Supercritical fluid\" refers to a fluid having a pressure exceeding its critical pressure and a temperature exceeding its critical temperature (i.e., both the temperature and the pressure are above the critical point of the fluid).\n\n\n\"Sub-critical fluid\" refers to a fluid or condensed phase having a sub- critical temperature ratio between about 0.95 and about 1.0, wherein the sub-critical temperature ratio equals the actual temperature divided by the critical temperature \n\n (TR\nbU\nb-cπticai \n=\n T\nac\ntuai/T\nc\n). Alternatively, \"sub-critical fluid\" refers to a fluid or condensed phase having a sub-critical pressure ratio between about 0.95 and about 1.0, wherein the sub-critical pressure ratio equals the actual pressure divided by the critical temperature (PR\nSU\nb-cπticai = Pactuai/Pc)- Unless otherwise expressly specified, all of the numerical ranges, amounts, values and percentages such as those for quantities of materials, times, temperatures, reaction conditions, ratios of amounts, values for molecular weight (whether number average molecular weight M\nn\n or weight average molecular weight M\nw\n), and others disclosed herein should be understood as modified in all instances by the term \"about,\" if about is not expressly used in combination with said ranges, amounts, values, and percentages herein. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the present disclosure and attached claims are approximations that can vary. At the very least, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.\n\n\nNotwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, is inherently somewhat uncertain because of the standard deviation found in its respective testing measurement. Furthermore, when numerical ranges of varying scope are set forth herein, it is contemplated that any combination of these values inclusive of the recited values can be used in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure.\n\n\nExamples provided herein, including those following \"such as\" and \"e.g.,\" are considered as illustrative only of various aspects and features of the present disclosure and embodiments thereof, and thus should not alter the scope of any of the referenced terms or phrases. Any suitable equivalents, alternatives, and modifications thereof (including materials, substances, constructions, compositions, formulations, means, methods, conditions, etc.) known and/or available to one skilled in the art can be used or carried out in place of or in combination with those disclosed herein, and are considered to fall within the scope of the present disclosure. Throughout the \n\n present disclosure in its entirety, any and all of the one, two, or more features and aspects disclosed herein, explicitly or implicitly, following terms \"example\", \"examples\", \"such as\", \"e.g.\", and the likes thereof may be practiced in any combinations of two, three, or more thereof (including their equivalents, alternatives, and modifications), whenever and wherever appropriate as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ aspects and features of the present disclosure in virtually any appropriate manner as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nMicroparticles\n\n\nNon-limiting microparticles, materials and methods for fabricating microparticles, compositions and formulations containing microparticles, and utilities of such microparticles, compositions, and formulations include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,525,519, 5,554,730, 5,578,709, 5,599,719, 5,981,719, 6,090,925, 6,268,053, and 6,458, 387, U.S. Publication Nos. 20030059474, 20030064033, 20040043077, 20050048127, 20050142201, 20050142205, 20050142206, 20050147687, 20050170005, 20050233945, 20060018971, 20060024240, 20060024379, 20060260777, 20070092452, 20070207210, and 20070281031, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nMicroparticles can have a generally uniform size distribution, such as a monodisperse size distribution, or a polydisperse size distribution, and a generally uniform shape, such as being substantially spherical. One or more characteristics of the microparticles can be adjusted during fabrication by manipulating one or more variables such as, but not limited to, selection of ingredients or combination thereof, concentrations of different ingredients, reaction temperature, reaction time, and/or pH if reaction is taken place in aqueous solution.\n\n\nMicroparticles are suitable for delivering, in vivo, ex vivo, and/or in vitro, one active agent or a combination of two or more active agents with rapid and/or controlled release profiles, and are useful for a wide variety of therapeutic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, medical, medicinal, cosmetic, nutritional, biocidic, \n\n separational, industrial, commercial, and research applications, such as drug delivery, vaccination, gene therapy and histopathological or in vivo tissue or tumor imaging. Microparticles can be formulated for oral, parenteral, mucosal; ophthalmic; intravenous, subcutaneous, subdermal, intradermal, intra-articular, intramuscular, pulmonary (including oral and nasal inhalations), and/or topical administrations to a subject.

It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the macromolecule can be a portion (e.g., fragment, segment, subunit) of another larger macromolecule. It will be further understood that macromolecules include affinity molecules, which can be, for example, the receptor or ligand portions of a receptor-ligand interaction. Non- limiting examples of ligands include viruses, bacteria, polysaccharides, or toxins that act as antigens to generate immune responses when administered to an animal and cause the production of antibodies.\n\n\nOne or more ingredients other than the macromolecules described above and the active agents described below including but not limited to polymers, complexing agents, stabilizing agents, excipients, ions, moisture, residual solvents, impurities, by-products, may be present in the microparticle at a quantity of 50% or less, 30% or less, 20% or less, 10% or less, 5% or less, or 2% or less, or greater than 0%, by weight and/or volume of the microparticle, or in a range between any two of such values. Additionally, any ingredients present in the reaction/incubation medium (e.g., such as non-volatile materials) during the formation of the microparticles can be substantially removed from and thus absent in the resulting microparticles. Immediately or at a later stage following their formation (which may or may not be in-situ), the microparticles may be dispersed (e.g., as colloids or suspensions) in a continuous solid phase (e.g., a frozen solid comprising the dispersion) or in a non- \n\n solid phase (e.g., a flowable medium, such as the reaction/incubation medium in which the microparticles are formed, or a washing medium).\n\n\nThe microparticles may have a density substantially the same as or different from (such as greater than or less than) that of the continuous phase (measured at the same temperature, such as ambient temperature). Densities of the microparticles, and the continuous phase equal their respective weight divided by their respective volume. The microparticles may have a density less than, equal to, or greater than values such as 0.8 g/cm\n3\n, 0.95 g/cm\n3\n, 1.0 g/cm\n3\n, 1.05 g/em\n3\n, 1.1 g/cm\n3\n, 1.3 g/cm\n3\n, 1.35 g/cm\n3\n, 1.5 g/cm\n3\n, and 1.9 g/cm\n3\n, or in a range between any two of such values, such as between 1.0 g/cm\n3\n and 1.5 g/cm\n3\n or between 1.2 g/cm\n3\n and 1.5 g/cm\n3\n. Density of the microparticles may be measured by helium pycnometry at ambient temperature, by density-gradient techniques (e.g., using centrifugation or ultracentrifugation) using suitable gradient medium (e.g., salts of alkali metals such as NaCl, NaBr, NaI, KBr, CsF, CsCl, CsBr, cesium sulfate, cesium acetate, cesium trifluoroacetate, RbCl, and potassium tartrate; neutral, water-soluble molecules such as sucrose with optional addition of glucose, glycerol, or mineral oil; hydrophilic macromolecules such as dextran, sucrose-epichlorohydrin copolymer, and bovine serum albumin; other synthetic molecules such as sodium or methyl glucamine salts of triiodobenzoic acid and of metrizoic acid, and metrizamide), and other known methods.

The active agent may also be a diagnostic agent. Non-limiting diagnostic agents include x-ray imaging agents and contrast media. Non-limiting examples of x-ray imaging agents include ethyl 3,5-diacetamido-2,4,6-triiodobenzoate (WTN-8883, ethyl ester of diatrazoic acid); 6-ethoxy-6-oxohexyl-3,5-bis(acetamido)- 2,4,6-triiodobenzoate (WIN 67722); ethyl-2-(3,5-bis(acetamido)-2,4,6- triiodobenzoyloxy)-butyrate (WIN 16318); ethyl diatrizoxyacetate (WIN 12901); ethyl 2-(3,5-bis(acetamido)-2,4,6-triiodobenzoyloxy)propionate (WIN 16923); N- ethyl 2-(3,5-bis(acetamido)-2,4,6-triiodobenzoyloxy-acetamide (WIN 65312); isopropyl 2-(3,5-bis(acetamido)-2,4,6-triiodobenzoyloxy)acetamide (WIN 12855); diethyl 2-(3,5-bis(acetamido)-2,4,6-triiodobenzoyloxymalonate (WIN 67721); ethyl 2-(3,5-bis(acetamido)-2,4,6-triiodobenzoyloxy)phenyl-acetate (WIN 67585); propanedioic acid, [[3,5-bis(acetylamino)-2,4,5-triodobenzoyl]oxy]bis(l-methyl)ester (WIN 68165); and benzoic acid, 3,5-bis(acetylamino)-2,4,6-triodo-4-(ethyl-3-ethoxy- 2-butenoate)ester (WIN 68209).

Non-limiting exemplary combinations include a steroid and a beta-agonist, e.g., fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol, etc. Many other viable therapeutically active agent combinations are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nContinuous Phase The continuous phase of the multi -phasic dispersion may be non-solid, for example, a liquid phase containing one solvent or a homogeneous mixture of two or more solvents (wherein at least a first solvent is soluble in or miscible with at least a second solvent), or a multiple phase system including at least two immiscible solvents. Non-limiting examples of the solvents include aqueous fluids (e.g., water H\n2\nO, D\n2\nO, aqueous buffers, and other aqueous solutions), non-aqueous fluids (e.g., organic solvents, organic buffers), and combinations of two or more of the foregoing. \n\n In one aspect, the non-solid continuous phase may be substantially aqueous, for example, containing more than 10% by volume, such as 25% or more, 50% or more, or 75%, or more water. The continuous phase may be partially or completely aqueous or aqueous-miscible, aqueous-immiscible, water-soluble, or water-insoluble. The continuous phase or the liquid phase(s) thereof may have a density at ambient temperature that is less than or equal to values such as 1.10 g/cm\n3\n, 1.05 g/cm\n3\n, 1.0 g/cm\n3\n, 0.95 g/cm\n3\n, 0.9 g/cm\n3\n, 0.8 g/cm\n3\n, 0.7 g/cm\n3\n, 0.6 g/cm\n3\n, or in a range between any two of such values. When measured at the same ambient temperature, such as 2O\n0\nC or 25\nα\nC, the continuous phase or liquid phase(s) typically have a density similar or equal to, or less than that of the dispersed phase or the microparticles therein. Most typically, the continuous phase or the liquid phase(s) have a density less than that of the microparticles.\n\n\nThe continuous phase may further contain one or more ingredients dissolved and/or dispersed therein including but not limited to ionic and/or non-ionic polymers, salts, ions, excess reagents, excipients (e.g., sugars, polyols, surfactants), and/or manufacturing-related compounds. Non-limiting examples of salts include ammonium acetate, ammonium bicarbonate, and other buffer salts known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of sugars include trehalose, sucrose, lactose, and other carbohydrates known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Non- limiting examples of polyols include mannitol and other sugar alcohols known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The one or more fluids and/or solutes of the continuous phase may be, independently, partially or fully aqueous-miscible, aqueous- immiscible, water-soluble, and/or water-insoluble.\n\n\nThe continuous phase typically contains at least one non-volatile material solubilized therein. The continuous phase, for example, the solvent thereof and/or the non- volatile material therein may be soluble in and/or miscible with the super critical fluid or sub-critical fluid, for example, having a solubility therein at ambient temperature of 10% by weight or greater, such as equal to or greater than values such as 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or in a range between any two of such values. Additionally, the continuous phase, the solvent thereof and/or the non-volatile material therein may be entirely miscible with \n\n the super critical fluid or sub-critical fluid. Greater solubility values for the continuous phase and/or components thereof in the super critical fluid or sub-critical fluid are generally preferred as such greater solubilities facilitate removal of the continuous phase from the dispersions in accordance with the disclosed methods. Non-volatile material\n\n\nAs previously indicated, at least the continuous phase typically contains at least one non- volatile material such as a non-ionic polymer solubilized therein, the one or more non-volatile materials being different in their chemical structures and/or compositions from that of the one or more rnacromolecules that form the microparticles. It should be noted that the non- volatile material may be present on/in the dispersed phase, too, for example, the non-volatile material may be trapped within pores of the microparticles and/or otherwise associated with the microparticles.\n\n\nGenerally, the non-volatile materials have a boiling point and/or a flash point greater than about 100\n0\nC, greater than about 15O\n0\nC, and/or greater than about 200\n0\nC. The non- volatile materials can be natural, synthetic, semi-synthetic, or recombinant. The one or more non-volatile materials are typically non-ionic polymers which can be independently hydrophilic, amphiphilic, aqueous-soluble (e.g., water- soluble), and/or aqueous-miscible (e.g., water-miscible), but of course, other nonvolatile materials including ionic polymers and salts of non-ionic materials may also be used. The one or more non- volatile materials can beneficially independently or collectively reduce the solubility of one or more macromolecules in the continuous phase (and thus of the microparticles formed therefrom), or in the one or more solvents therein. The one or more non- volatile materials, when present in the continuous phase, typically do not covalently and/or ionically interact with, or denature, the one or more macromolecules in the microparticles. Additionally, the one or more non-volatile materials, when present in the continuous phase, typically do not complex, conjugate, aggregate, and/or agglomerate with each other, or otherwise come together, such as via covalent, ionic, and/or other interactions. Further, the one or more non-volatile materials in the continuous phase typically do not undergo gelation (e.g., form a hydrogel), either by themselves or with other ingredients present in the continuous phase. The one or more non-volatile materials independently \n\n generally have molecular weights greater than or equal to values such as 200 daltons, 300 daltons, 400 daltons, 600 daltons, 800 daltons, 1,000 daltons, 1,500 daltons, 2,000 daltons, 2,500 daltons, 3,000 daltons, 3,500 daltons, 4,000 daltons, 5,000 daltons, 8,000 daltons, and 10,000 daltons, or up to about 3,000 kilodaltons (kd), or in a range between any two of such values, for example, between 1000 daltons and 1500 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 2,000 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 2,500 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 3,000 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 3,500 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 4,000 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 5,000 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 8,000 daltons, between 1000 daltons and 10,000 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 2,000 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 2,500 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 3,000 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 3,500 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 4,000 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 5,000 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 8,000 daltons, between 1,500 daltons and 10,000 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 2,500 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 3,000 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 3,500 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 4,000 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 5,000 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 8,000 daltons, between 2,000 daltons and 10,000 daltons.\n\n\nNon-limiting examples of non- volatile materials for the continuous phase include the non-ionic water-soluble and/or water-miscible polymers disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,525,519, 5,554,730, 5,578,709, 5,599,719, 5,981,719, 6,090,925, 6,268,053, and 6,458, 387, U.S. Publication Nos. 20030059474, 20030064033, 20040043077, 20050048127, 20050142201, 20050142205, 20050142206, 20050147687, 20050170005, 20050233945, 20060018971, 20060024240, 20060024379, 20060260777, 20070092452, 20070207210, and 20070281031 , the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

For example, salts of polysaccharides such as dextran sulfate, dextrin sulfate, and sodium alginate, can also be used.\n\n\nDispersed Phase The dispersed phase of the multi-phasic dispersion may comprise solid microparticles. Typically, it is preferred that the microparticles are substantially \n\n insoluble in and/or substantially immiscible with the super critical fluid or sub-critical fluid, for example, having a solubility therein at ambient temperature of less than 10% by weight, such as 5 wt.% or less, 3 wt.% or less, 1 wt.% or less, 0.5 wt.% or less, 0.1 wt. % or less, 0.05 wt.% or less, 0.01 wt.% or less, or in a range between any two of such values.\n\n\nThe dispersed phase may further include other materials in association with the solid microparticles, for example, a non-volatile material, salt, or excipient added during microparticle formation. Generally, such materials are not desired in the isolated microparticles and are therefore desirably removed from the dispersion. Accordingly, it is desirable for such materials to have greater solubilities in the super critical fluid or sub-critical fluid as described above in the continuous phase section.\n\n\nApparatus for Separating the Microparticles\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 1 , a multi -phasic dispersion including dispersed and continuous phases can be positioned within a chamber or vessel 10 capable of being pressurized so it can be contacted with a gas and/or a fluid to enable and/or facilitate the separation of the continuous phase from the dispersion (or the microparticles therein) to provide microparticles that are substantially free of the nonvolatile material and/or the solvent. Typically, the dispersion is positioned within an extraction basket 20 (or similar structure capable of retaining the microparticles while allowing any liquids containing the non- volatile material and/or other undesirable components such as solvents, excipients, salts, and other solutes to be separated therefrom) to facilitate contact with the gas and/or fluid. The extraction basket 20 is typically formed from an inert material such as stainless steel. A representative extraction basket structure 20 includes a hollow sleeve cylinder with solid poreless side walls and two identical stainless steel disk sieves (for example, having a pore size between 0.2 microns and 0.5 microns, or larger such as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 microns) coupled to both ends of the extraction basket (e.g., mounted with stainless steel caps or plates or clamps and bolts) to permit entry and egress of the gas and/or fluid. Alternatively, the extraction basket 20 can be composed of two cylindrical cups having open ends capable of mating together (for example, by threads and reciprocal grooves) to form an enclosed cylinder with suitable disk sieves 30 mounted on the \n\n bottom of the cups. The size and volume of the basket 20 is only practicably limited by the size of the vessel 10. However, the size of the pores of the disk sieves 30 should be sufficiently small to adequately retain the microparticles of the dispersion during the contacting step(s). Contacting the Continuous Phase with a Pressurizing Gas\n\n\nThe multi-phasic dispersion is typically initially contacted with a gas at an elevated pressure such that at least a portion of any liquid associated with the dispersed phase can be forced through the sieve 30, thereby separating at least a portion of the non-volatile material and solvent from the dispersion so as to concentrate the microparticles, which are retained by the sieve 30. The multi-phasic dispersion may be concentrated into a relatively more viscous dispersion prior to being positioned within the chamber by performing a concentration step such as diafiltration or centrifugation on the initial dispersion, but it is not necessary to carry out such a concentration step. The pressurizing gas is introduced into the chamber via gas inlet valve\n\n\n40. Suitable gases include carbon dioxide, nitrogen, compressed air, and mixtures thereof. The various gases can be mixed off-line and introduced into the system as a mixture, or can be mixed on line via suitable apparatus (not shown).\n\n\nThe pressure of the pressurizing gas(es) within the vessel 10 is typically greater than or equal to 10 bar but also less than the supercritical pressure of the gas. Because the supercritical pressure of a gas varies with composition, the high end of suitable pressures for the contacting step can vary. The supercritical pressures of many gases and mixtures thereof are well known or can be reasonably determined or estimated using known methods [see, for example, Kroschwitz, J., exec, ed., Kirk- Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, pp. 452-477, volume 23, 4\nth\n ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1997)]. Typically, the chamber 10 is pressurized to a pressure greater than or equal to 10 bar, 15 bar, 20 bar, 25 bar, 30 bar, 35 bar, 40 bar, 45 bar, 50 bar, 55 bar, and/or 60 bar, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 10 bar and 60 bar, between 10 bar and 55 bar, between 10 bar and 50 bar, between 10 bar and 45 bar, between 10 bar and 40 bar, between 10 bar and 30 bar, between 10 bar and 25 bar, between 10 bar and 20 bar, and/or between 10 bar and \n\n 15 bar, or between 15 bar and 60 bar, between 15 bar and 55 bar, etc. Pressure gauge 50 is used to monitor the pressure of the chamber 10. The gas pressure is maintained for at least 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, one minute, two minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes and/or up to one hour, two hours, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 2 seconds and 2 hours and/or between 5 seconds and two minutes.\n\n\nThe selected pressurizing gas(es) can be heated (or cooled) with a suitable heat exchanger (not shown) as appropriate and flowed into chamber 10 at a temperature less than its supercritical temperature. Supercritical temperatures are well known or can be reasonably estimated or determined using known techniques [see, for example, Kroschwitz, J., exec, ed., Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, pp. 452-477, volume 23, 4\nth\n ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1997)]. A temperature indicator and controller 60 can be used to monitor the temperature within the chamber 10. Typically, the pressurizing gas temperature is greater than or equal to 0\n0\nC, 5\n0\nC, 10\n0\nC, 15°C, 2O\n0\nC, 25°C, 3O\n0\nC, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between O\n0\nC and 30\n0\nC, between O\n0\nC and 25\n0\nC, between 0\n0\nC and 20\n0\nC, between 0\n0\nC and 15\n0\nC, between O\n0\nC and 1O\n0\nC, between 0\n0\nC and 5°C, between 5°C and 30\n0\nC, between 5\n0\nC and 25°C, between 5\n0\nC and 20\n0\nC, between 5°C and 15°C, between 5\n0\nC and 10\n0\nC, etc. When the multi-phasic dispersion is contacted with the pressurizing gas, at least a portion of any liquid of the dispersion can be forced through the sieve 30 by the positive gas pressure, thereby separating at least a portion of the nonvolatile material and/pr solvent from the dispersion, which is retained by the sieve 30. Accordingly, after the contacting is completed, the gas inlet valve 40 can be shut off, and a valve 70, for example, a ball valve, at the bottom of the chamber 10 can be opened to at least partially depressurize the system and drain any liquid collected therein. Additional contacting steps wherein the gas is pressurized to a pressure, for example, greater than or equal to 10 bar but below the supercritical pressure of the gas, can be carried out until no (including substantially no) additional liquid flows from valve 70 upon opening same. The pressurizing gas(es) used in the additional \n\n contacting steps can be the same or different from the pressurizing gas(es) used in the first contacting step.\n\n\nContacting the Dispersion with an Extracting Fluid\n\n\nWhen substantially no additional liquid flows from valve 70, the chamber can optionally be repressurized with a second gas, which may be the same or different from the gas used in the prior contacting steps (using pressurizing gas), to a pressure greater than or equal to its supercritical pressure so as to provide an extracting fluid in the form of a supercritical fluid or a sub-critical fluid. For example, the chamber 10 is typically pressurized to a pressure greater than or equal to 70 bar, 80 bar, 90 bar, 100 bar, 150 bar, 200 bar, 225 bar, 250 bar, 275 bar, and/or 300 bar, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 70 bar and 300 bar, between 70 bar and 275 bar, between 70 bar and 250 bar, between 70 bar and 225 bar, between 70 bar and 200 bar, between 70 bar and 150 bar, etc.. The gas pressure is maintained for at least 2 seconds, at least 5 seconds, at least 10 seconds, at least 15 seconds, at least 20 seconds, at least 30 seconds, at least 45 seconds, at least one minute, at least two minutes, at least 5 minutes, and/or up to 10 minutes, up to one hour, up to two hours, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 2 seconds and 2 hours, between 2 seconds and 1 hour, between 2 seconds and 10 minutes, between 2 seconds and two minutes, etc. The employed gas can also be heated (as is typically necessary for it to take the form of a supercritical or a sub-critical fluid). For example, the gas may be heated to a temperature greater than its supercritical temperature. Surprisingly, contacting microparticles comprising active agents (for example, bioactive macromolecules) with a supercritical or a sub-critical fluid does not lead to appreciable degradation of the active agent. Such degradation is prevented by controlling the temperature of the system; the gas should not be heated to a temperature at which the formed fluid (supercritical or sub-critical) will degrade and/or denature the active agent in the microsphere. Such degradation temperatures will vary depending on the selected active agent(s) in the microspheres and the gas(es) used to provide the supercritical or sub-critical fluid, but can be easily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art with routine experimentation. Typically, \n\n the gas temperature is greater than or equal to 20\n0\nC, 22.5°C, 25\n0\nC, 27.5°C, 3O\n0\nC, 32.5°C, 35°C, 37.5°C, 4O\n0\nC, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 2O\n0\nC and 37.5\n0\nC, between 2O\n0\nC and 25°C, etc. Of course, the supercritical temperature of a gas varies with its composition so other values may also be appropriate.\n\n\nAs with the pressurizing gas described above, the gas(es) forming the supercritical or sub-critical fluid is introduced into the chamber via gas inlet valve 40. The gas may be a single gas or a mixture of two or more gases. Representative gases include carbon dioxide, isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, water, toluene, ethylene, xenon, ethane, dimethyl ether, nitrous oxide, propane, ammonia, butane, pentane, and mixtures thereof. A preferred gas is dimethylether because of its dipole moment. Dimethylether is typically provided as a sub-critical fluid for the reasons described above relating to the degradation of active agent within the microspheres because of its relatively high super critical temperature (127\n0\nC). A preferred mixture comprises carbon dioxide and a second co-solvent component such as ethanol or isopropanol in a volume or weight ratio between 1 :99 and 99: 1 , between 5:95 and 95:5, for example, 70:30 carbon dioxide/ethanol. The various gases can be mixed off-line and introduced into the system as a mixture, or can be mixed on line via suitable apparatus (as described above). When this step is carried out, a supercritical or sub-critical fluid is provided within the chamber to contact a remaining portion of the multi-phasic dispersion, thereby separating substantially all of the remaining or residual nonvolatile material and/or solvent and other components from the multi-phasic dispersion, and providing microparticles that are substantially free of non-volatile material, salts, excipients, and/or other solutes. For example, the obtained microparticles can contain less than 5 wt.% non-volatile material, less than 4 wt.% non-volatile material, less than 3 wt.% non-volatile material, less than 2 wt.% nonvolatile material, less than 1 wt.% non-volatile material, less than 0.5 wt.% nonvolatile material, less than 0.25 wt.% non- volatile material, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 0.25 wt.% and 5 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.25 wt.% and 4 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.25 wt.% \n\n and 3 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.25 wt.% and 2 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.25 wt.% and 1 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.25 wt.% and 0.5 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.5 wt.% and 5 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.5 wt.% and 4 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.5 wt.% and 3 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.5 wt.% and 2 wt.% non-volatile material, between 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% non-volatile material, etc. Similarly, the obtained microparticles contain less than 5 wt.% solvent, less than 4 wt.% solvent, less than 3 wt.% solvent, less than 2 wt.% solvent, less than 1 wt.% solvent, less than 0.5 wt.% solvent, less than 0.25 wt.% solvent, or any range between these disclosed values, for example, between 0.25 wt.% and 5 wt.% solvent, between 0.25 wt.% and 4 wt.% solvent, between 0.25 wt.% and 3 wt.% solvent, between 0.25 wt.% and 2 wt.% solvent, between 0.25 wt.% and 1 wt.% solvent, between 0.25 wt.% and 0.5 wt.% solvent, between 0.5 wt.% and 5 wt.% solvent, between 0.5 wt.% and 4 wt.% solvent, between 0.5 wt.% and 3 wt.% solvent, between 0.5 wt.% and 2 wt.% solvent, between 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% solvent, etc.\n\n\nAfter the contacting step is conducted, a third gas, for example, a humidified gas such as humidified nitrogen, humidified air, or humidified noble gases, can optionally be directed or passed over the obtained microparticles to beneficially exchange any remaining residual solvent therein with water. Specifically, the microparticles are placed in a supporting member (e.g., vials, trays, pans, dishes), which is in turn placed in a chamber (e.g., dry box, lyophilizer) under a stream of the humidified gas. Contacting the microparticles with a humidified gas having a relative humidity of 25% to 100%, such as 30% to 95%, 40% to 90%, or 50% to 80%, facilitates the evaporation of residual solvent from the microparticles. Following the high humidity evaporation process, which may last from hours (e.g., 10, 12, 20 hrs) to days depending on the volume or weight of the mieroparticle composition, the residual solvent content therein can be further reduced. If the residual solvent is not water miscible, a gas containing little to no humidity can be used to achieve similar benefits. As discussed above, preferably, the dispersed phase or at least the microparticles therein are insoluble in the supercritical or sub-critical fluid, and the \n\n continuous phase or at least one solvent or non-volatile material therein is soluble in or miscible with the supercritical fluid. The continuous phase of the dispersion as a whole, or one or more of the continuous phase components (such as a liquid, like water, and/or a solute, like a polymer) therein, is therefore preferably more soluble in and/or miscible with the supercritical fluid than the microparticles. As such, the one or more supercritical fluids may be suitable as differential solubility systems to separate (e.g., extract, wash, exclude, displace, remove) the continuous phase or at least one or more components therein from the microparticles. In one example, the continuous phase, which can be aqueous, organic, and/or multi-component (e.g., binary, ternary) is partially or fully miscible with the supercritical fluid. In another example, the one or more solutes (such as one or more non-ionic polymers) in the continuous phase have a solubility in the supercritical fluid of 10% by weight or greater, such as less than, equal to, or greater than values such as 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or in a range between any two of such values.\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to illustrate the invention, but is not intended to limit the scope thereof.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nThis example discloses a process to remove at least a portion of a non- volatile material and./or a solvent from a dispersion comprising microparticles to thereby harvest microparticles substantially free of non- volatile material and/or solvent in a single process.\n\n\nSpecifically, a dispersion containing a dispersed phase of IGIV microparticles in a continuous phase comprising a non-volatile material (PEG 300) was loaded into a stainless steel extraction basket, and placed in a supercritical fluid vessel chamber. The SCF chamber was then sealed and pressurized to 40 bar with carbon dioxide. The CO\n2\n supply was turned off to partially depressurize the SCF chamber (the pressure was dropped to 20-30 bar), and a ball valve at the bottom of the SCF chamber was opened slightly. At this point, a liquid, which generally comprised the non-volatile material, filtered through the extraction basket under the increased gas pressure of the chamber, and was removed from the system through the opened \n\n ball valve. The sub-critical gas pressurization and subsequent liquid draining were repeated until no additional liquid drained from the system upon opening the ball valve. The SCF chamber was then sealed, and a SCF/co-solvent extraction process was initiated to remove any residual continuous phase, under the following conditions: 98 wt.% of CO\n2\n with 2 wt.% ethanol at a flow rate of 50 g/min (up-flow), 250 bar, and 35°C.\n\n\nIn this example, IGIV microspheres, which were substantially free of non-volatile material were obtained.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 This example also discloses a process to remove at least a portion of a non-volatile material and/or a solvent from a dispersion comprising microparticles to thereby harvest microparticles substantially free of non- volatile material and/or solvent in a single process.\n\n\nA dispersion containing a dispersed phase of IGIV microparticles in a continuous phase comprising a non- volatile material (PEG 3350) and water was loaded into a stainless steel extraction basket, and placed in a supercritical fluid vessel chamber. The SCF chamber was then sealed and pressurized to 40 bar with carbon dioxide. The CO\n2\n supply was turned off to partially depressurize the SCF chamber (the pressure was dropped to 20-30 bar), and a ball valve at the bottom of the SCF chamber was opened slightly. At this point, a liquid, which generally comprised the non-volatile material and water, filtered through the extraction basket under the increased gas pressure of the chamber, and was removed from the system through the opened ball valve. The sub-critical gas pressurization and subsequent liquid draining were repeated until no additional liquid drained from the system upon opening the ball valve. The SCF chamber was then sealed, and a SCF/co-solvent extraction process was initiated to remove any residual continuous phase and/or solvent, under the following conditions: 70 wt.% CO\n2\n with 30 wt.% ethanol at a total flow rate of 100 g/min (up-flow), 250 bar, and 20 \n0\nC.\n\n\nIn this example, IGIV microspheres, which were substantially free of solvent and non-volatile material were obtained. \n\n EXAMPLE 3\n\n\nThis prophetic example discloses a process to remove at least a portion of a non-volatile material and/or a solvent from a dispersion comprising microparticles to thereby harvest microparticles substantially free of non-volatile material and/or solvent in a single process.\n\n\nA dispersion containing a dispersed phase of insulin microparticles in a continuous phase comprising a non- volatile material (poloxamer 188 or PEG 300 or tetraglycol) and water is loaded into a stainless steel extraction basket, and placed in a supercritical fluid vessel chamber. The SCF chamber is then sealed and pressurized to 30 bar with carbon dioxide. The CO\n2\n supply is turned off to partially depressurize the SCF chamber (the pressure is dropped to 10-20 bar), and a ball valve at the bottom of the SCF chamber is opened slightly. At this point, a liquid, which generally comprises the non- volatile material and water, filters through the extraction basket under the increased gas pressure of the chamber, and is removed from the system through the opened ball valve. The sub-critical gas pressurization and subsequent liquid draining are repeated until no additional liquid drains from the system upon opening the ball valve. The SCF chamber is then sealed, and a SCF extraction process is initiated to remove any residual continuous phase, under the following conditions: 90 wt.% CO\n2\n with 10 wt.% ethanol at a total flow rate of 100 g/min (up-flow), 200 bar, and 35 \n0\nC. In this prophetic example, insulin microspheres, which are substantially free of solvent and non-volatile material are obtained.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nThis prophetic example also discloses a process to remove at least a portion of a non-volatile material and/or a solvent from a dispersion comprising microparticles to thereby harvest microparticles substantially free of non-volatile material and/or solvent in a single process.\n\n\nA dispersion containing a dispersed phase of microparticles containing plasmid DNA (pCMV, Promega, WI) in a continuous phase comprising a non-volatile material (PEG 3350) and polyvinylpyrrolidone is loaded into a stainless steel extraction basket, and placed in a supercritical fluid vessel chamber. The SCF \n\n chamber is then sealed and pressurized to 40 bar with carbon dioxide. The CO\n2\n supply is turned off to partially depressurize the SCF chamber (the pressure was dropped to about 5 bar), and a ball valve at the bottom of the SCF chamber was opened slightly. At this point, a liquid, which generally comprises the non-volatile material and solvent, filters through the extraction basket under the increased gas pressure of the chamber, and is removed from the system through the opened ball valve. The sub- critical gas pressurization and subsequent liquid draining are repeated until no additional liquid drains from the system upon opening the ball valve. The SCF chamber is then sealed, and a SCF/co-solvent extraction process is initiated to remove any residual continuous phase and/or solvent, under the following conditions: 90 wt.% CO\n2\n with 10 wt.% ethanol at a total flow rate of 100 g/min (up-flow), 250 bar, and 20 \n0\nC.\n\n\nIn this prophetic example, DNA-containing microspheres, which are substantially free of solvent and non- volatile material are obtained. EXAMPLE 5\n\n\nThis example demonstrates the successful removal of various nonvolatile materials using super-critical or sub-critical fluids.\n\n\nA sample containing aapproximately twenty grams of one or more liquid non-volatile materials (PEG 200, PEG 300, tetraglycol, propylene glycol, or a combination comprising a 1 :1 ratio of propylene glycol to PLURONIC® LlO) were each individually loaded into a stainless steel extraction basket, and placed in a supercritical fluid vessel chamber. The SCF chamber was then sealed and a SCF extraction process was initiated to extract the non-volatile material from the basket under the following conditions: 100 wt. % CO\n2\n at a total flow rate of 50 g/min (up- flow), 250 bar, and 35 \n0\nC. The chamber was depressurized at one bar per minute, hi each instance, 20 grams of non- volatile material were extracted within an hour.\n\n\nSpecifically, the non-volatile material remaining after 60 minutes of SCF processing was weighed and compared to the amount of polymer initially loaded into the extraction chamber. The following table shows the amount of polymer removal using SCF compared to original polymer weight. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis example therefore demonstrates the successful removal (and substantially complete removal in nearly each instance) of various non-volatile materials using super-critical or sub-critical fluids.\n\n\nNumerous modifications and variations of the invention are expected to occur to those skilled in the art in view of the accompanying disclosure. Consequently only such limitations as appear in the appended claims should be placed on the invention."

Description\n\n\n\n\n NOVEL ANTI- α5βl ANTIBODIES AND USES THEREOF\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n[00001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/ 163241, filed March 25, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[00002] The present invention relates to novel αsβi antibodies, compositions and kits comprising the antibodies and methods for using the antibodies.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[00003] α5βl integrin is a cell membrane glycoprotein that mediates cell-ECM interactions through its major ligand, fibronectin. α5βl integrin plays a role in cell migration, differentiation and survivial. Levels of α5βl integrin are elevated in tumor vascular endothelium (e.g., gastric, colorectal hepatocellular, uterocervial, and breast carcinomas) and other angiogenic vessels. α5βl integrin modulates mural cell association with endothelial cells and the assembly of the endothelial extracellular matrix during angiogenesis.

Introduction\n\n\n[00030] The present invention is based on the identification of novel antibodies that bind αsβi integrin. The αsβi antibodies are derived from the monoclonal antibody 18C12 and can be used in a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic methods. For example, the αsβi antibodies can be used alone or in combination with other agents for treating abnormal angiogenesis, neoplasia, ocular diseases and autoimmune diseases. The antibodies can also be used for detecting αsβi protein in patients or patient samples by administering the antibodies to α\n5\nβi protein in patients and detecting the anti-α\n5\nβi antibody bound to the α\n5\nβi protein in a sample from the patient (e.g., in vivo or ex vivo) or by contacting the antibodies with samples from patients and detecting qualitatively or quantitatively the anti-αsβi antibody bound to the αsβi protein.\n\n\nII. Definitions\n\n\n[00031] \"Alpha5betal\" or \"α5βl\" or \"a5bl\" or \"α\n5\nβi\" is an integrin comprising two different proteins (i.e., subunits Alpha5 and betal). α5βl has been shown to bind to fϊbronectin, Ll-CAM and fibrinogen. α5βl integrin is also known as Very Late Activation-5, VLA-5, alpha5betal, CD49e/CD29, fibronectin receptor, FNR and GPIc-IIa. According to a embodiment, the α5βl is a human α5βl.\n\n\n[00032] \"Alpha5\" is used herein interchangeably with CD49e, α5, integrin alpha5 subunit, VLA-5 alpha subunit, IC subunit of GPIc-IIa and FNR alpha chain refers to one subunit of the αsβi integrin. Alpha5 has four isoforms generated by alternative splicing (A- D) and which vary within their cytoplasmic domains. Amino acid sequences for human isforms of alpha5 can be found at, e.g., Genbank accession numbers: X07979, U33879, U33882 and U33880, respectively.\n\n\n[00033] \"Betal\" also called CD29, betal, Platelet GPIIa; VLA-beta chain; beta-1 integrin chain, CD29; FNRB; MDF2; VLAB; GPIIA; MSK12 and VLA5B. Amino acid sequences for human Betal can be found, e.g., at Genbank Accession No. X06256.\n\n\n[00034] The term \"VEGF\" as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 189-, and 206- amino acid human \n\n vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by Leung et al. Science, 246:1306 (1989), and Houck et al. MoI. Endocrin., 5:1806 (1991), together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms thereof. The term \"VEGF\" also refers to VEGFs from non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF, and etc. The term \"VEGF\" is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide comprising amino acids 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165 -amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in the present application, e.g., by \"VEGF (8-109),\" \"VEGF (1-109)\" or \"VEGFi\n65\n.\" The amino acid positions for a \"truncated\" native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and FIt-I receptors comparable to native VEGF. According to a embodiment, the VEGF is a human VEGF.\n\n\n[00035] A \"VEGF antagonist\" refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities including its binding to VEGF or one or more VEGF receptors or the nucleic acid encoding them. Preferrably, the VEGF antagonist binds VEGF or a VEGF receptor. VEGF antagonists include anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, polypeptides that bind VEGF and VEGF receptors and block ligand-receptor interaction {e.g. , immunoadhesins, peptibodies), anti-VEGF receptor antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinases, aptamers that bind VEGF and nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions to nucleic acid sequences that encode VEGF or VEGF receptor {e.g., RNAi). According to one embodiment, the VEGF antagonist binds to VEGF and inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. According to one embodiment, the VEGF antagonist binds to VEGF or a VEGF receptor with greater affinity than a non-VEGF or non-VEGF receptor. According to one embodiment, the VEG antagonist binds to VEGF or a VEGF receptor with a Kd of between 1 μM and IpM. According to another embodiment, the VEGF antagonist binds to VEGF or a VEGF receptor between 500 nM and 1 pM.\n\n\n[00036] According a embodiment, the VEGF antagonist is selected from the group consisting of a polypeptide such as an antibody, a peptibody, an immunoadhesin, a small molecule or an aptamer. In a embodiment, the antibody is an anti-VEGF antibody such as the AVASTIN\n®\n antibody or an anti-VEGF receptor antibody such as an anti-VEGFR2 or an \n\n anti-VEGFR3 antibody. Other examples of VEGF antagonists include: VEGF -Trap, Mucagen, PTK787, SUl 1248, AG-013736, Bay 439006 (sorafenib), ZD-6474, CP632, CP- 547632, AZD-2171, CDP-171, SU-14813, CHIR-258, AEE-788, SB786034, BAY579352, CDP-791, EG-3306, GW-786034, RWJ-417975/CT6758 and KRN-633.\n\n\n[00037] An \"anti-VEGF antibody\" is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity and specificity. Preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be used as a therapeutic agent in targeting and interfering with diseases or conditions wherein the VEGF activity is involved. An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF or bFGF. A anti-VEGF antibody is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 10709. More preferably the anti-VEGF antibody is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599, including but not limited to the antibody known as bevacizumab (BV; Avastin®). According to another embodiment, anti-VEGF antibodies that can be used include, but are not limited to the antibodies disclosed in WO 2005/012359. According to one embodiment, the anti- VEGF antibody comprises the variable heavy and variable light region of any one of the antibodies disclosed in Figures 24, 25, 26, 27 and 29 of WO 2005/012359 (e.g., G6, G6-23, G6-31, G6-23.1, G6-23.2, B20, B20-4 and B20.4.1). In another embodiment, the anti-VEGF antibody known as ranibizumab is the VEGF antagonist administered for ocular disease such as diabetic retinopathy and wet AMD.\n\n\n[00038] The anti-VEGF antibody \"Bevacizumab (BV)\", also known as \"rhuMAb VEGF\" or \"Avastin®\", is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599. It comprises mutated human IgGl framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity- determining regions from the murine anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of human VEGF to its receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of Bevacizumab, including most of the framework regions, is derived from human IgGl, and about 7% of the sequence is derived from the murine antibody A4.6.1. Bevacizumab has a molecular mass of about 149,000 daltons and is glycosylated. Other anti-VEGF antibodies include the antibodies described in U.S. Patent No. 6,884,879 and WO 2005/044853.\n\n\n[00039] The anti-VEGF antibody Ranibizumab or the LUCENTIS® antibody or rhuFab V2 is a humanized, affinity-matured anti-human VEGF Fab fragment. Ranibizumab \n\n is produced by standard recombinant technology methods in E. coli expression vector and bacterial fermentation. Ranibizumab is not glycosylated and has a molecular mass of -48,000 daltons. See WO98/45331 and U.S. 2003/0190317.\n\n\n[00040] Molecules, such as antibodies, characterized by binding to overlapping or the similar areas on a target can be identified by competitive inhibition/binding assays.\n\n\n[00041] In one embodiment, HUVEC or other cells expressing αsβi are used in a competitive inhibition assay and FACS is used to evaluate binding localities of two anti-αsβi antibodies relative to each other. For example, HUVEC cells can be washed in conical tube and spun 5 min @ 1000 rpm. The pellet is typically washed two times. Then, the cells can be resuspended, counted and kept on ice until use. 100 μl of a first anti-αsβi antibody {e.g., start at a 1 μg/ml concentration or lower concentration) can be added to the well. Next, 100 μl {e.g., 20 x 10\n5\n cells) of cells can be added into per well and incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, lOOμl of a biotinylated anti-α\n5\nβi antibody (5 μg/ml stock) can be added to each well and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells are then washed and pelleted for 5 min. @ 1000 rpm. The supernatant is aspirated. R-Phycoerythrin conjugated streptavidin (Jackson 016- 110-084) is added to the well (100 μl @ 1 : 1000). Next, the plate can be wrapped in foil and incubated on ice 30 min. Following the incubation, the pellet can be washed and pelleted 5 min. @ 1000 rpm.

It should be understood that the anti-angiogenic agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenic agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or FIt-I receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors, small molecules that block VEGF receptor signaling (e.g., PTK787/ZK2284, SU6668, SUTENT®/SU11248 (sunitinib malate), AMG706, or those described in, e.g., international patent application WO 2004/113304).

Nos. 6,534,524 and 6,235,764, both of which are incorporated in their entirety for all purposes. Anti-angiogenic agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors , e.g., \n\n angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore (1991) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 53:217-39; Streit and Detmar (2003) Oncogene 22:3172-3179 (e.g., Table 3 listing anti- angiogenic therapy in malignant melanoma); Ferrara & Alitalo (1999) Nature Medicine 5(12): 1359-1364; Tonini et al. (2003) Oncogene 22:6549-6556 (e.g., Table 2 listing known antiangiogenic factors); and, Sato (2003) Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 8:200-206 (e.g., Table 1 listing anti-angiogenic agents used in clinical trials).\n\n\n[00044] The term \"anti-angiogenic therapy\" refers to a therapy useful for inhibiting angiogenesis which comprises the administration of an anti-angiogenic agent.\n\n\n[00045] The \"Kd\" or \"Kd value\" for an antibody an anti-VEGF antibody according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by a radiolabeled VEGF binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and a VEGF molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for VEGF or by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled molecule VEGF(109) in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled VEGF, then capturing bound VEGF with an anti- Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al, (1999) J. MoI Biol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23°C). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]VEGF(109) are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest, {e.g., Fab-12 (Presta et al, (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates had dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25\n0\nC with immobilized target molecule hVEGF (8-109) CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl- N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and iV-hydroxysuccinimide\n\n\n(NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human VEGF is diluted with 10 mM sodium \n\n acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 μg/ml (~0.2 μM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of human VEGF, IM ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately 25 μl/min. Association rates (Ic\n0n\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al, (1999) J. MoI Biol 293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6\n M\n\"1\n S\n\"1\n by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on- rate is can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25°C of a 2OnM anti-VEGF antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of human VEGF short form (8-109) or mouse VEGF as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. Similar binding assays can be performed for determining the Kd of an anti- α5βl Fab or antibody using α5βl as the target.\n\n\n[00046] As used herein, a subject to be treated is a mammal {e.g., human, non-human primate, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat, etc.). The subject may be a clinical patient, a clinical trial volunteer, an experimental animal, etc. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having a cancer, an immune disease, or any other disease having abnormal angiogenesis, be diagnosed with a cancer, immune disease, or any other diease having abnormal angiogenesis. Many diagnostic methods for cancer, immune disease or any other disease exhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and the clinical delineation of those diseases are known in the art. According to one embodiment, the subject to be treated according to this invention is a human.\n\n\n[00047] \"Abnormal angiogenesis\" occurs when new blood vessels grow either excessively or otherwise inappropriately {e.g., the location, timing, degree, or onset of the angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. In some cases, excessive, uncontrolled, or otherwise inappropriate angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of the diseased state or cause of a diseased state, such as in cancer, especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors (including colon, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung \n\n cancer), or prostate cancer), diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), diabetic macular edema, pathological myopia, von Hippel-Lindau disease, histoplasmosis of the eye, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO), corneal neovascularization, retinal neovascularization and rubeosis; psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, haemangioblastoma such as haemangioma; inflammatory renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis; various imflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psorsasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis and diseases occurring after transplants, endometriosis or chronic asthma and more than 70 other conditions.

Abnormal vascular permeability may lead to excessive or otherwise inappropriate \"leakage\" of ions, water, nutrients, or cells through the vasculature. In some cases, excessive, uncontrolled, or otherwise inappropriate vascular permeability or vascular leakage exacerbates or induces disease states including, e.g., edema associated with tumors including, e.g., brain tumors; ascites associated with malignancies; Meigs' syndrome; lung inflammation; nephrotic syndrome; pericardial effusion; pleural effusion,; permeability associated with cardiovascular diseases such as the condition following myocardial infarctions and strokes and the like.

No. 4,675,187), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above.\n\n\n[00071] The term \"prodrug\" as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance (e.g., small molecule) that is less cytotoxic to diseased cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman, \"Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy\" Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et ah, \"Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,\" Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et ah, (ed.), pp. 247 '-267 ', Humana Press (1985). The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\n[00072] \"Isolated,\" when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a cell or cell culture from which it was expressed. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and can include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n[00073] An \"isolated\" polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or other polypeptide- encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid. An isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated \n\n polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\n[00074] The term \"control sequences\" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n[00075] Nucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n[00076] \"Stringent conditions\" or \"high stringency conditions\", as defined herein, can be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 5OC; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/5 OmM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42C; or (3) overnight hybridization in a solution that employs 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5 x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42\n0\nC, with a 10 minute wash at 42\n0\nC in 0.2 x SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) followed by a 10 minute high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55\n0\nC. \n\n [00077] The amino acid sequences described herein are contiguous amino acid sequences unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n[00078] As used herein, the term \"immunoadhesin\" designates antibody-like molecules that combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an \"adhesin\") with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity that is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is \"heterologous\"), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand - such as a VEGFR or a fibronectin ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin can be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-I, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-I and IgA-2), IgE, IgD, or IgM. Peptibodies, which often comprise a sequence derived from phage display selection of sequences that specifically bind a target fused to an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, can be considered immunadhesins herein.\n\n\n[00079] The term \"antibody\" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, for example, single monoclonal antibodies (including agonist, antagonist, and neutralizing antibodies), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, polyclonal antibodies, single chain anti- antibodies, and fragments of antibodies (see below) as long as they specifically bind a native polypeptide and/or exhibit a biological activity or immunological activity of this invention. According to one embodiment, the antibody binds to an oligomeric form of a target protein, e.g., a trimeric form. According to another embodiment, the antibody specifically binds to a protein, which binding can be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody of this invention (e.g., a deposited antibody of this invention, etc.). The phrase \"functional fragment or analog\" of an antibody is a compound having a qualitative biological activity in common with an antibody to which it is being referred. For example, a functional fragment or analog of an antibody of this invention can be one which can specifically bind to VEGF or α5βl . In one embodiment, the antibody can prevent or substantially reduce the ability of a VEGF to induce cell proliferation.\n\n\n[00080] An \"isolated antibody\" is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and can include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than \n\n 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n[00081] The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains (an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain, and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites, while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units along with J chain). In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to a H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (Vfj) followed by three constant domains (C fj) for each of the α and γ chains and four Cfj domains for μ and ε isotypes. Each L chain has at the N- terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain (CL) at its other end. The VL is aligned with the VJJ and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (C]-[I)- Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VJJ and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, 8th edition, Daniel P. Stites, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow (eds.), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.\n\n\n[00082fJ The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CJJ), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated α, δ, γ, ε, and μ, respectively. The γ and α classes are further divided into \n\n subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in CJJ sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2.\n\n\n[00083] The term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110-amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead, the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called \"hypervariable regions\" that are each 9-12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., SEQUENCES OF PROTEINS OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).\n\n\n[00084] The term \"hypervariable region\" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \"complementarity determining region\" or \"CDR\" {e.g. around about residues 24-34 (Ll), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the V\nL\n, and around about 31-35B (Hl), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the VH (in one embodiment, Hl is around about 31-35); Kabat et al, supra and/or those residues from a \"hypervariable loop\" {e.g. residues 26-32 (Ll), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the V\nL\n, and 26-32 (Hl), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the V\nH\n; Chothia and LeskJ. MoI. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)).\n\n\n[00085] Throughout the present specification and claims, the Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately, residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g, Kabat et al, supra (1991)). The \"EU numbering system\" or \"EU index\" is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region {e.g. , the EU index reported in Kabat et al., supra (1991) expressly incorporated herein by reference). Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residues numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means \n\n residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system.\n\n\n[00086] The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that can be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they can be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \"monoclonal\" is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention can be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or can be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial, eukaryotic animal or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" can also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991), Marks et al., J. MoI. Biol. , 222:581-597 (1991) or using the methods set forth in the Examples below.\n\n\n[00087] The monoclonal antibodies herein include \"chimeric\" antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit a biological activity of this invention (see U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al, PNAS USA, 81 :6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \"primatized\" antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate {e.g. Old World Monkey, Ape etc), and human constant region sequences.\n\n\n[00088] An \"affinity matured\" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity \n\n matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al, Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al, PNAS USA 91 :3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al, Gene 169: 147-155 (1995); Yelton et al, J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al, J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. MoI. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).\n\n\n[00089] A \"blocking\" antibody or an \"antagonist\" antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. For example blocking or antagonist anti- α5βl antibodies partially or completely inhibit the angiogenesis by binding α5βl .\n\n\n[00090] An \"agonist\" antibody is one which enhances or increases biological activity of the antigen it binds. For example agonist antibodies anti-α5βl antibodies enhance angiogenesis by binding α5βl .\n\n\n[00091] An \"intact\" antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding site as well as a CL and at least heavy chain constant domains, C]-[I, Cfj2 and Cfj3. The constant domains can be native sequence constant domains {e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.\n\n\n[00092] \"Antibody fragments\" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S.\n\n\nPatent No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al, Protein Eng, 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n\n[00093] The expression \"linear antibodies\" generally refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al, Protein Eng., 8(10): 1057-1062 (1995). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CHl-VH-CHl) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\n[00094] Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (Vn), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain \n\n (Cfj 1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab')2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen- binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the Cpfl domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n[00095] The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.\n\n\n[00096] A \"variant Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one \"amino acid modification\" as herein defined. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region herein will possess at least about 80% homology, at least about 85% homology, at least about 90% homology, at least about 95% homology or at least about 99% homology with a native sequence Fc region. According to another embodiment, the variant Fc region herein will possess at least about 80% homology, at least about 85% homology, at least about 90% homology, at least about 95% homology or at least about 99% homology with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide. [00097] The term \"Fc region-comprising polypeptide\" refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin (see definitions below), which comprises an Fc region. The C- terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly, a composition comprising polypeptides, including antibodies, having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides populations with all K447 residues removed, \n\n polypeptide populations with no K447 residues removed or polypeptide populations having a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.\n\n\n[00098] \"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen- recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light- chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n[00099] \"Single-chain Fv\" also abbreviated as \"sFv\" or \"scFv\" are antibody fragments that comprise the VJJ and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vpf and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994); Borrebaeck 1995, infra.\n\n\n[00100] The term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the Vpf and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., fragment having two antigen- binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two \"crossover\" sFv fragments in which the Vpf and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al, PNAS USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993).\n\n\n[00101] \"Humanized\" antibodies are forms of non-human {e.g., rodent) antibodies that are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non-human antibody. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired antibody specificity, affinity, and capability. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, \n\n humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al, Nature 321 :522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al, Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992).\n\n\n[00102] A \"species-dependent antibody\" is an antibody which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody \"bind specifically\" to a human antigen (i.e., has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than about\n\n\n1 x 10\n~\n7 M, no more than about 1 x 10\n~\n8 or no more than about 1 x 10\n~\n9 M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second non-human mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be of any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\n[00103] In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition to a \"non-target\" protein will be less than about 10% of the binding of the polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). With regard to the binding of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition to a target molecule, the term \"specific binding\" or \"specifically binds to\" or is \"specific for\" a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term \"specific binding\" or \n\n \"specifically binds to\" or is \"specific for\" a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10\n~\n4 M, at least about 10\"^ M, at least about 10\n~\n6 M, at least about 10\n~\n7 M, at least about 10\"^ M, at least about 10\"9 M, alternatively at least about 10' 10 M, at least about 10\"! 1 M, at least about 10\" 12 M, or greater. In one embodiment, the term \"specific binding\" refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.\n\n\n[00104] Antibody \"effector functions\" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: CIq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors; and B cell activation. A \"native sequence Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Examples of Fc sequences are described in, for example, but not limited to, Kabat et ah, supra (1991)).\n\n\n[00105] \"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" or \"homology\" with respect to the polypeptide and antibody sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the polypeptide being compared, after aligning the sequences considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D. C, 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California. The ALIGN-2 program \n\n should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n[00106] The terms \"Fc receptor\" or \"FcR\" are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In one embodiment, an FcR of this invention is one that binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an \"activating receptor\") and FcγRIIB (an \"inhibiting receptor\"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, (see review M. in Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997)). The term includes allotypes, such as FcγRIIIA allotypes: FcγRIIIA-Phel58, FcγRIIIA- Vall58, FcγRIIA-R131 and/or FcγRIIA-H131. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al, Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \"FcR\" herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al, J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al, J. Immunol . 24:249 (1994)).\n\n\n[00107] The term \"FcRn\" refers to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is structurally similar to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and consists of an α-chain noncovalently bound to β2-microglobulin. The multiple functions of the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn are reviewed in Ghetie and Ward (2000) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 18, 739-766. FcRn plays a role in the passive delivery of immunoglobulin IgGs from mother to young and the regulation of serum IgG levels. FcRn can act as a salvage receptor, binding and transporting pinocytosed IgGs in intact form both within and across cells, and rescuing them from a default degradative pathway.\n\n\n[00108] WO 00/42072 (Presta) and Shields et al J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The contents of those publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n[00109] The \"CHl domain\" of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \"Cl\" of \"Hl\" domain) usually extends from about amino acid 118 to about amino acid 215 (EU numbering system). \n\n [00110] \"Hinge region\" is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgGl (Burton, Molec. Immunol.22:l6l-206 (1985)). Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgGl sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain S-S bonds in the same positions.\n\n\n[00111] The \"lower hinge region\" of an Fc region is normally defined as the stretch of residues immediately C-terminal to the hinge region, i.e. residues 233 to 239 of the Fc region. In previous reports, FcR binding was generally attributed to amino acid residues in the lower hinge region of an IgG Fc region.\n\n\n[00112] The \"CH2 domain\" of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \"C2\" of \"H2\" domain) usually extends from about amino acid 231 to about amino acid 340. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N- linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It has been speculated that the carbohydrate may provide a substitute for the domain-domain pairing and help stabilize the CH2 domain. Burton, Molec. Immunol.22:\\6\\-206 (1985).\n\n\n[00113] The \"CH3 domain\" (also referred to as \"C2\" or \"H3\" domain) comprises the stretch of residues C-terminal to a CH2 domain in an Fc region (i.e. from about amino acid residue 341 to the C-terminal end of an antibody sequence, typically at amino acid residue 446 or 447 of an IgG).\n\n\n[00114] A \"functional Fc region\" possesses an \"effector function\" of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary \"effector functions\" include CIq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays as herein disclosed, for example.\n\n\n[00115] \"CIq\" is a polypeptide that includes a binding site for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. CIq together with two serine proteases, CIr and CIs, forms the complex C 1 , the first component of the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathway. Human CIq can be purchased commercially from, e.g. Quidel, San Diego, CA.\n\n\n[00116] The term \"binding domain\" refers to the region of a polypeptide that binds to another molecule. In the case of an FcR, the binding domain can comprise a portion of a polypeptide chain thereof (e.g. the alpha chain thereof) which is responsible for binding an Fc region. One useful binding domain is the extracellular domain of an FcR alpha chain. \n\n [00117] An antibody or peptibody with a variant IgG Fc with \"altered\" FcR binding affinity or ADCC activity is one which has either enhanced or diminished FcR binding activity (e.g, FcγR or FcRn) and/or ADCC activity compared to a parent polypeptide or to a polypeptide comprising a native sequence Fc region. The variant Fc which \"exhibits increased binding\" to an FcR binds at least one FcR with higher affinity (e.g., lower apparent Kd or IC50 value) than the parent polypeptide or a native sequence IgG Fc. According to some embodiments, the improvement in binding compared to a parent polypeptide is about 3 fold, preferably about 5, 10, 25, 50, 60, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 fold, or about 25% to 1000% improvement in binding. The polypeptide variant which \"exhibits decreased binding\" to an FcR, binds at least one FcR with lower affinity (e.g, higher apparent Kd or higher IC50 value) than a parent polypeptide. The decrease in binding compared to a parent polypeptide may be about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or more decrease in binding.\n\n\n[00118] \"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\" or \"ADCC\" refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound to Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies \"arm\" the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in US Patent No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 or in the Examples below may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998).\n\n\n[00119] The polypeptide comprising a variant Fc region which \"exhibits increased ADCC\" or mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of human effector cells more effectively than a polypeptide having wild type IgG Fc or a parent polypeptide is one which in vitro or in vivo is substantially more effective at mediating ADCC, when the amounts of polypeptide with variant Fc region and the polypeptide with wild type Fc region (or the parent polypeptide) in the assay are essentially the same. \n\n Generally, such variants will be identified using the in vitro ADCC assay as herein disclosed, but other assays or methods for determining ADCC activity, e.g. in an animal model etc, are contemplated. In one embodiment, the preferred variant is from about 5 fold to about 100 fold, e.g. from about 25 to about 50 fold, more effective at mediating ADCC than the wild type Fc (or parent polypeptide) .\n\n\n[00120] \"Complement dependent cytotoxicity\" or \"CDC\" refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (CIq) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et ah, J. Immunol. Methods 202: 163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n[00121] Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased CIq binding capability are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,194,551 and WO 99/51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Idusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).\n\n\n[00122] \"Human effector cells\" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. According to one embodiment, the cells express at least FcγRIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.\n\n\n[00123] Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie 1997, Hinton 2004). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g, in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides. In one embodiment, specifically the anti- α5βl antibodies of the invention having a variant IgG Fc exhibits increased binding affinity for human FcRn over a polypeptide having wild-type IgG Fc, by at least 2 fold, at least 5 fold, at least 10 fold, at least 50 fold, at least 60 fold, at least 70 fold, at least 80 fold, at least 100 fold, at least 125 fold, at least 150 fold. In a specific embodiment, the binding affinity for human FcRn is increased about 170 fold.\n\n\n[00124] For binding affinity to FcRn, in one embodiment, the EC50 or apparent Kd (at pH 6.0) of the polypeptide is less than 1 μM, more preferably less than or equal to 100 nM, \n\n more preferably less than or equal to 10 nM. In one embodiment, for increased binding affinity to FcγRIII (F158; i.e. low-affinity isotype) the EC50 or apparent Kd less is than or equal to 10 nM, and for FcγRIII (V158; high-affinity isotype) the EC50 or apparent Kd is less than or equal to 3 nM. According to another embodiment, a reduction in binding of an antibody to a Fc receptor relative to a control antibody (e.g., the Herceptin® antibody) may be considered significant relative to the control antibody if the ratio of the values of the absorbances at the midpoints of the test antibody and control antibody binding curves (e.g,\n\n\n\nnm(\nco\nn\nt\nr\noi\nA\nb\n)\n ) is less than or equal to 40%. According to another embodiment, an increase in binding of an antibody to a Fc receptor relative to a control antibody (e.g., the Herceptin® antibody) may be considered significant relative to the control antibody if the ratio of the values of the absorbances at the midpoints of the test antibody and control antibody binding curves (e.g, A\n450\n\n\n\n equal to 125%.\n\n\n[00125] A \"parent polypeptide\" or \"parent antibody\" is a polypeptide or antibody comprising an amino acid sequence from which the variant polypeptide or antibody arose and against which the variant polypeptide or antibody is being compared. Typically the parent polypeptide or parent antibody lacks one or more of the Fc region modifications disclosed herein and differs in effector function compared to a polypeptide variant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native sequence Fc region or an Fc region with preexisting amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions and/or substitutions).\n\n\n[00126] Antibodies of this invention can be derived from phage display. As used herein, \"library\" refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences, or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\n[00127] \"Phage display\" is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol, 3:355-362 (1992), and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion \n\n thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, Methods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology, 3:205-0216 (1991).\n\n\n[00128] A \"phagemid\" is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g. , Co 1 E 1 , and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.\n\n\n[00129] The term \"phage vector\" means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an Ml 3, fl, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as lambda, 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.\n\n\n[00130] Covalent modifications of polypeptides such as peptibodies, immunoadesins, antibodies and short peptides are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C- terminal residues of the polypeptide. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful, for instance, for crosslinking the polypeptide to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying antibodies, and vice-versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., l,l-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxy- succinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'-dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), \n\n bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-l,8-octane and agents such as methyl-3- [(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate.\n\n\n[00131] Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the α-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains [T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)], acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C- terminal carboxyl group.\n\n\n[00132] Other modifications include the conjugation of toxins to the antagonists such as maytansine and maytansinoids, calicheamicin and other cytotoxic agents.\n\n\n[00133] Another type of covalent modification of the polypeptide comprises linking the polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337.\n\n\n[00134] The polypeptide of the present invention can also be modified if advantageous in a way to form a chimeric molecule comprising the polypeptide fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence (e.g., immunoadhesins or peptibodies).\n\n\n[00135] In one embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the polypeptide with a protein transduction domain which targets the polypeptide for delivery to various tissues and more particularly across the brain blood barrier, using, for example, the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein (Schwarze et ah, 1999, Science 285: 1569-72).\n\n\n[00136] In another embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the polypeptide with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti-tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or carboxyl- terminus of the polypeptide. The presence of such epitope-tagged forms of the polypeptide can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also, provision of the epitope tag enables the polypeptide to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are known in the art. Examples include poly- histidine (poly-His) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-His-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field et al, MoI. Cell. Biol, 8:2159-2165 (1988)]; the c-myc tag \n\n and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto [Evan et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology, 5:3610-3616 (1985)]; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody [Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering, 3(6):547-553 (1990)]. Other tag polypeptides include the Flag-peptide [Hopp et al, BioTechnology, 6: 1204-1210 (1988)]; the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al., Science, 255:192-194 (1992)]; an α-tubulin epitope peptide [Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:15163-15166 (1991)]; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag [Lutz-Freyermuth et al., PNAS USA, 87:6393-6397 (1990)].\n\n\n[00137] In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule can comprise a fusion of the polypeptide with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (e.g., an \"immunoadhesin\"), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. Ig fusions of this invention include polypeptides that comprise approximately or only residues 94-243, residues 33-53 or residues 33-52 of human in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CHl, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgGl molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also, U.S. Patent No. 5,428,130.\n\n\n[00138] The invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth. In various embodiments, a cancer is relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced, or has increased, or tumor size has not been significantly reduced, or has increased, or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. The determination of whether the cancer cells are relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells. A tumor resistant to anti- VEGF treatment is an example of a relapse tumor growth.\n\n\n[00139] An \"effective amount\" of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition as disclosed herein is an amount sufficient to carry out a specifically stated purpose. An \"effective amount\" can be determined empirically and by known methods relating to the stated purpose.\n\n\n[00140] The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount of an antibody, polypeptide or antagonist of this invention effective to \"treat\" a disease or disorder in a mammal (aka patient). In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size or weight; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit \n\n (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug can prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it can be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount is a growth inhibitory amount. In another embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount is an amount that extends the survival of a patient. In another embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount is an amount that improves progression free survival of a patient.\n\n\n[00141] In the case of wound healing, the term \"effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to accelerate or improve wound healing in a subject. A therapeutic dose is a dose which exhibits a therapeutic effect on the patient and a sub-therapeutic dose is a dose which does not exhibit a therapeutic effect on the patient treated.\n\n\n[00142] A \"chronic wound\" refers a wound that does not heal. See, e.g., Lazarus et ah, Definitions and guidelines for assessment of wounds and evaluation of healing, Arch. Dermatol. 130:489-93 (1994). Chronic wounds include, but are not limited to, e.g., arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, etc. An acute wound can develop into a chronic wound. Acute wounds include, but are not limited to, wounds caused by, e.g., thermal injury, trauma, surgery, excision of extensive skin cancer, deep fungal and bacterial infections, vasculitis, scleroderma, pemphigus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, etc. See, e.g., Buford, Wound Healing and Pressure Sores, HealingWell.com, published on: October 24, 2001. A \"normal wound\" refers a wound that undergoes normal wound healing repair.\n\n\n[00143] A \"growth inhibitory amount\" of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition of this invention is an amount capable of inhibiting the growth of a cell, especially tumor, e.g., cancer cell, either in vitro or in vivo. A \"growth inhibitory amount\" of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition of this invention for purposes of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth can be determined empirically and by known methods or by examples provided herein.\n\n\n[00144] A \"cytotoxic amount\" of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition of this invention is an amount capable of causing the destruction of a cell, especially tumor, e.g., cancer cell, either in vitro or in vivo. A \"cytotoxic amount\" of a polypeptide, antibody, antagonist or composition of this invention for purposes of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth can be determined empirically and by methods known in the art.\n\n\n[00145] An \"autoimmune disease\" herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual's own tissues or a co-segregate or manifestation thereof or \n\n resulting condition therefrom. Examples of autoimmune diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis such as acute arthritis, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis, degenerative arthritis, infectious arthritis, Lyme arthritis, proliferative arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, vertebral arthritis, and juvenile-onset rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, arthritis chronica progrediente, arthritis deformans, polyarthritis chronica primaria, reactive arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis), inflammatory

substance or quantifying the amount of a substance. The term thus refers to the use of the materials, compositions, and methods of the present invention for qualitative and quantitative determinations. In general, the particular technique used for detection is not critical for practice of the invention.\n\n\n[00147] For example, \"detecting\" according to the invention may include: observing the presence or absence of α5 gene product, a βl gene product (e.g., mRNA molecules), or an α5 or α5βl polypeptide; a change in the levels of an α5 or α5βl polypeptide or amount bound to a target; a change in biological function/activity of an α5 or α5βl polypeptide. In some embodiments, \"detecting\" may include detecting wild type α5 or α5βl levels (e.g., mRNA or polypeptide levels). Detecting may include quantifying a change (e.g., an increase or decrease) of any value of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%, or more when compared to a control. Detecting may include quantifying a change of any value of at least about 2-fold, 3- fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, or more e.g., 20-fold, 30-fold, 4- fold, 50-fold,60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold, 90-fold, 100-fold or more. \n\n [00148] \"Label\" when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody. The label may itself be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable. III. Anti- α5βl Antibodies\n\n\n[00149] Antibodies that can bind human α5βl and competitively inhibit the binding of the anti-α5βl 18C12 antibody to human α5βl are provided herein. Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention provides antibodies comprising a variable light (VL) sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 and a variable heavy (VH) sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14. Human or chimeric (including, e.g., humanized) forms of the antibodies of the anti-α5βl antibodies described herein are also contemplated.\n\n\n[00150] According to one embodiment, the antibody binds a human α5βl with a Kd between 500 nM and 1 pM. In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of < lμM, < 100 nM, < 10 nM, < 1 nM, < 0.1 nM, < 0.01 nM, or < 0.001 nM (e.g. 10\n\"8\n M or less, e.g. from 10\n\"8\n M to 10\n\"13\n M, e.g., from 10\n\"9\n M to 10\n\"13\n M). According to another embodment, the antibody does not bind αVβ3 or αVβ5 or αVβl. According to another embodiment, the antibody comprises an Fc sequence of a human IgG, e.g., human IgGl or human IgG4. In another embodiment, an Fc sequence has been altered or otherwise changed so that it that lacks antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector function, often related to their binding to Fc receptors (FcRs). There are many examples of changes or mutations to Fc sequences that can alter effector function. For example, WO 00/42072 and Shields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The contents of those publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. The antibody can be in the form of a Fab, Fab', a F(ab)'\n2\n, single-chain Fv (scFv), an Fv fragment; a diabody and a linear antibody. Also, the antibody can be a multi-specific antibody that binds to α5βl and is an α5βl antagonist, but also binds one or more other targets and inhibits their function {e.g., VEGF) or a multi-specific antibody that binds to two or more different sites on α5βl . The antibody can be conjugated to a therapeutic agent (e.g., cytotoxic agent, a radioisotope and a chemotherapeutic agent) or a label for detecting α5βl in patient samples or in vivo by imaging (e.g., radioisotope, fluorescent dye and enzyme).\n\n\n[00151] Nucleic acid molecules encoding the anti- α5βl antibodies, expression vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules encoding one or both variable domains, and cells \n\n comprising the nucleic acid molecules are also contemplated. These antibodies can be used in the therapies described herein and to detect α5βl protein in patient samples (e.g., using FACS, immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA assays) or in patients.\n\n\nA. Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n[00152] Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared, e.g., using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975) or can be made by recombinant DNA methods (US Patent No. 4,816,567) or can be produced by the methods described herein in the Examples below. In a hybridoma method, a hamster, mouse, or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent (e.g., an α5, βl, or α5βl polypeptide alone or in combination with a suitable carrier) to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro.\n\n\n[00153] The immunizing agent will typically include a polypeptide or a fusion protein of the protein of interest or a composition comprising the protein. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes (\"PBLs\") are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell. Goding, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (New York: Academic Press, 1986), pp. 59-103. Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine, and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n[00154] Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the SaIk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies. Kozbor, J. Immunol., \n\n 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS (Marcel Dekker, Inc.: New York, 1987) pp. 51-63.\n\n\n[00155] The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptide. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).\n\n\n[00156] After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. Goding, supra. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI- 1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.\n\n\n[00157] The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n[00158] The monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., supra) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non- immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the \n\n variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.\n\n\n[00159] The antibodies can be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy-chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking.\n\n\n[00160] In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly Fab fragments, can be accomplished using, but not limited to, techniques known in the art.\n\n\nB. Human Antibodies\n\n\n[00161] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5: 368-74 (2001) and Lonberg, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 20:450-459 (2008).\n\n\n[00162] Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, Nat. Biotech. 23: 1117-1125 (2005). See also, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 describing XENOMOUSE™ technology; U.S. Patent No. 5,770,429 describing HUMAB® technology; U.S. Patent No. 7,041,870 describing K-M MOUSE® technology, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0061900, describing VELOCIMOUSE® technology). Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified, e.g. , by combining with a different human constant region.\n\n\n[00163] Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma-based methods. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. (See, e.g., Kozbor J. Immunol, 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. \n\n 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al, J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991).) Human antibodies generated via human R-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li ei al, PNAS USA, 103.3557-3502 (2006). Additional methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,189,826 (describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines) and Ni, Xiandai Mianyixue, 26(4):265-268 (2006) (describing human-human hybridomas). Human hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is also described in Vollmers and Brandlein, Histology and Histopathology, 20(3):927-937 (2005) and Vollmers and Brandlein, Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, 27(3):185-91 (2005).\n\n\n[00164] Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human-derived phage display libraries. Such variable domain sequences may then be combined with a desired human constant domain. Techniques for selecting human antibodies from antibody libraries are described below.\n\n\nC. Library-Derived Antibodies\n\n\n[00165] Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al, Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al, Nature 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al, J. MoI Biol. 222: 581-597 (1992); Marks and Bradbury, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:161-175 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003); Sidhu et al, J. MoI Biol. 338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al, J. MoI Biol. 340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, PNAS USA 101(34): 12467- 12472 (2004); and Lee et al, J. Immunol. Methods 284(1-2): 119-132(2004).\n\n\n[00166] In certain phage display methods, repertoires of VH and VL genes are separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be screened for antigen-binding phage as described in Winter et al, Ann. Rev. Immunol, 12: 433-455 (1994). Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned {e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., EMBOJ, 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive \n\n libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J. MoI Biol, 227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: US Patent No. 5,750,373, and US Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0079574, 2005/0119455, 2005/0266000, 2007/0117126, 2007/0160598, 2007/0237764, 2007/0292936, and 2009/0002360.\n\n\n[00167] Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from human antibody libraries are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments herein.\n\n\nD. Chimeric and Humanized Antibodies\n\n\n[00168] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a chimeric antibody. Certain chimeric antibodies are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al, PNAS USA, 81 :6851-6855 (1984)). In one example, a chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non-human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In a further example, a chimeric antibody is a \"class switched\" antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n[00169] In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically, a non-human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans, while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non-human antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs, e.g., CDRs, (or portions thereof) are derived from a non-human antibody, and FRs (or portions thereof) are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments, some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non- human antibody (e.g., the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived), e.g., to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity.\n\n\n[00170] Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed, e.g., in Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008), and are further described, e.g., in Riechmann et al, Nature 332:323-329 (1988); Queen et al., PNAS USA 86:10029-10033 (1989); US Patent Nos. 5, 821,337, 7,527,791, 6,982,321, and 7,087,409; Kashmiri et al, Methods 36:25-34 (2005) (describing SDR (a-CDR) grafting); Padlan, MoI. Immunol. 28:489-498 (1991) (describing \"resurfacing\"); Dall'Acqua et al, Methods 36:43-60 (2005) \n\n (describing \"FR shuffling\"); and Osbourn et al., Methods 36:61-68 (2005) and Klimka et al, Br. J. Cancer, 83:252-260 (2000) (describing the \"guided selection\" approach to FR shuffling).\n\n\n[00171] Human framework regions that may be used for humanization include but are not limited to: framework regions selected using the \"best-fit\" method (see, e.g., Sims et al J. Immunol. 151 :2296 (1993)); framework regions derived from the consensus sequence of human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions (see, e.g., Carter et al. PNAS USA, 89:4285 (1992); and Presta et al. J. Immunol., 151 :2623 (1993)); human mature (somatically mutated) framework regions or human germline framework regions (see, e.g., Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008)); and framework regions derived from screening FR libraries (see, e.g., Baca et al, J. Biol. Chem. 272:10678-10684 (1997) and Rosok et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271 :22611-22618 (1996)).\n\n\nE. Multi-specific Antibodies\n\n\n[00172] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a multispecifϊc antibody, e.g. a bispecifϊc antibody. Multispecifϊc antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for α5βl and the other is for any other antigen {e.g., VEGF). In certain embodiments, bispecifϊc antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of α5βl. Bispecifϊc antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express α5βl. Bispecifϊc antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments.\n\n\n[00173] Techniques for making multispecifϊc antibodies include, but are not limited to, recombinant co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain- light chain pairs having different specificities (see Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537 (1983)), WO 93/08829, and Traunecker et al, EMBOJ. 10: 3655 (1991)), and \"knob-in-hole\" engineering (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,731 ,168). Multi-specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc-heterodimeric molecules (WO 2009/089004A1); cross-linking two or more antibodies or fragments (see, e.g., US Patent No. 4,676,980, and Brennan et al, Science, 229: 81 (1985)); using leucine zippers to produce bi-specifϊc antibodies (see, e.g., Kostelny et al, J. Immunol, 148(5):1547-1553 (1992)); using \"diabody\" technology for making bispecifϊc antibody fragments (see, e.g., Hollinger et al, PNAS USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993)); and using single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers (see,e.g. Gruber et al, J. Immunol, 152:5368 (1994)); and preparing trispecifϊc antibodies as described, e.g., in Tutt et al J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991). \n\n [00174] Engineered antibodies with three or more functional antigen binding sites, including \"Octopus antibodies,\" are also included herein (see, e.g. US 2006/0025576A1). The antibody or fragment herein also includes a \"Dual Acting FAb\" or \"DAF\" comprising an antigen binding site that binds to α5βl as well as another, different antigen (see, US 2008/0069820, for example).\n\n\nF. Antibody Variants\n\n\n[00175] In certain embodiments, amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies provided herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics, e.g., antigen-binding.\n\n\n1. Substitution, Insertion, and Deletion Variants\n\n\n[00176] In certain embodiments, antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the HVRs and FRs. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"conservative substitutions.\" More substantial changes are provided in Table 1 under the heading of \"exemplary substitutions,\" and as further described below in reference to amino acid side chain classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened for a desired activity, e.g., retained/improved antigen binding, decreased immunogenicity, or improved ADCC or CDC. \n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino acids may be grouped according to common side-chain properties:\n\n\n(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, VaI, Leu, He;\n\n\n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, GIn;\n\n\n(3) acidic: Asp, GIu;\n\n\n(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: GIy, Pro;\n\n\n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. \n\n [00177] One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display- based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity).\n\n\n[00178] Alterations (e.g., substitutions) maybe made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR \"hotspots,\" i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, Methods MoL Biol. 207:179-196 (2008)), and/or SDRs (a-CDRs), with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted.\n\n\n[00179] In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g. , conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may be outside of HVR \"hotspots\" or SDRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions.\n\n\n[00180] A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis\" as described by \n\n Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues {e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid {e.g. , alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.\n\n\n[00181] Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl -terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme {e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n2. Glycosylation variants\n\n\n[00182] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.\n\n\n[00183] Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. TIBTECH 15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (GIcNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GIcNAc in the \"stem\" of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.\n\n\n[00184] In one embodiment, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the \n\n amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (e. g. complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (Eu numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about ± 3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Examples of publications related to \"defucosylated\" or \"fucose- deficient\" antibody variants include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; US 2004/0093621; US 2004/0132140; US 2004/0110704; US 2004/0110282; US 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; WO2005/053742; WO2002/031140; Okazaki et al. J. MoI. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lee 13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 Al, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 Al, Adams et al, especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha- 1,6- fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (see, e.g., Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004); Kanda, Y. et al, Biotechnol Bioeng., 94(4):680-688 (2006); and WO2003/085107).\n\n\n[00185] Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides, e.g., in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GIcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003/011878 (Jean- Mairet et al.); US Patent No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 1997/30087 (Patel et al.); WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.); and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.). \n\n 3. Fc region variants\n\n\n[00186] In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein, thereby generating an Fc region variant, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in treating a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.\n\n\n[00187] In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. PNAS USA 83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., PNAS USA 82:1499-1502 (1985); 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTI™ nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, CA; and CytoTox 96\n®\n non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95:652-656 (1998). CIq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind CIq and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., CIq and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al, J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996); Cragg, M.S. et al., Bloo d 101 :1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, M.S. \n\n and MJ. Glennie, Blood 103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, S.B. et al, Intl. Immunol. 18(12):1759-1769 (2006)).\n\n\n[00188] Antibodies with reduced effector function include those with substitution of one or more of Fc region residues 238, 265, 269, 270, 297, 327 and 329 (U.S. Patent No. 6,737,056). Such Fc mutants include Fc mutants with substitutions at two or more of amino acid positions 265, 269, 270, 297 and 327, including the so-called \"DANA\" Fc mutant with substitution of residues 265 and 297 to alanine (US Patent No. 7,332,581).\n\n\n[00189] Certain antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs are described. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,737,056; WO 2004/056312, and Shields et al, J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).)\n\n\n[00190] In certain embodiments, an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which improve ADCC, e.g., substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (EU numbering of residues).\n\n\n[00191] In some embodiments, alterations are made in the Fc region that result in altered {i.e., either improved or diminished) CIq binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in US Patent No. 6,194,551, WO 99/51642, and Idusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).\n\n\n[00192] Mutations or alterations in the Fc region sequences can be made to improve FcR binding {e.g., FcgammaR, FcRn). According to one embodiment, an antibody of this invention has at least one altered effector function selected from the group consisting of ADCC, CDC, and improved FcRn binding compared to a native IgG or a parent antibody. Examples of several useful specific mutations are described in, e.g., Shields, RL et al. (2001) JBC 276(6)6591-6604; Presta, L.G., (2002) Biochemical Society Transactions 30(4):487- 490; and WO 00/42072. Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al, J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al, J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al ). Those antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Such Fc variants include those with substitutions at one or more of Fc region residues: 238, 256, 265, 272, 286, 303, 305, 307, 311, 312, 317, 340, 356, 360, 362, 376, 378, 380, 382, 413, 424 or 434, e.g., substitution of Fc region residue 434 (US Patent No. 7,371,826). \n\n [00193] See also Duncan & Winter, Nature 322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Patent No. 5,648,260; U.S. Patent No. 5,624,821; and WO 94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.\n\n\n4. Cysteine engineered antibody variants\n\n\n[00194] In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g., \"thioMAbs,\" in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments, the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine, reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties, such as drug moieties or linker-drug moieties, to create an immunoconjugate, as described further herein. In certain embodiments, any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine: V205 (Kabat numbering) of the light chain; Al 18 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain; and S400 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain Fc region. Cysteine engineered antibodies may be generated as described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 7,521,541.\n\n\n[00195] In some embodiments, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced into the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated can have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See, Caron et al, J. Exp. Med., 176: 1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, J. Immunol, 148: 2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity can also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al, Cancer Research, 53: 2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc regions and can thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See, Stevenson et al, Anti-Cancer Drug Design \n4\n 3: 219-230 (1989).\n\n\n5. Antibody Derivatives\n\n\n[00196] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein may be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. The moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody include but are not limited to water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3- dioxolane, poly-1, 3, 6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either \n\n homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g. , glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.\n\n\n[00197] In another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody- nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.\n\n\nG. Immunoconjugates\n\n\n[00198] The invention also provides immunoconjugates comprising an anti-α5βl antibody herein conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents or drugs, growth inhibitory agents, toxins {e.g., protein toxins, enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or radioactive isotopes.\n\n\n[00199] In one embodiment, an immunoconjugate is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in which an antibody is conjugated to one or more drugs, including but not limited to a maytansinoid (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 Bl); an auristatin such as monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF (MMAE and MMAF) (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,635,483 and 5,780,588, and 7,498,298); a dolastatin; a calicheamicin or derivative thereof (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701, 5,770,710, 5,773,001, and 5,877,296; Hinman et al, Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342 (1993); and Lode et al, Cancer Res. 58:2925-2928 (1998)); an anthracycline such as daunomycin or doxorubicin (see Kratz et ah, Current Med. Chem. 13:477-523 (2006); Jeffrey et al., Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 16:358-362 (2006); Torgov et al, Bioconj. Chem. 16:717-721 (2005); Nagy et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:829-834 \n\n (2000); Dubowchik et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Letters 12:1529-1532 (2002); King et al, J. Med.

A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugates. Examples include At\n211\n, 1\n131\n, 1\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212\n and radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the radioconjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc99m or 1123, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine- 123 again, iodine-131, indium-I l l, fluorine- 19, carbon- 13, nitrogen-15, oxygen- 17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.\n\n\nConjugates of an antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p- diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as l,5-difiuoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et ah, Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon- 14-labeled l-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a \"cleavable linker\" facilitating release of a cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, \n\n photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfϊde-containing linker (Chari et al, Cancer Res. 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Patent No. 5,208,020) may be used.\n\n\n[00202] The immunuoconjugates or ADCs herein expressly contemplate, but are not limited to such conjugates prepared with cross-linker reagents including, but not limited to, BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo- SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available {e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL., U.S.A).\n\n\nH. Immunoliposomes\n\n\n[00203] The antibodies disclosed herein can also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al, PNAS USA, 82: 3688 (1985); Hwang et al, PNAS USA, 11: 4030 (1980); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556.\n\n\n[00204] Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse-phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab' fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al, J. Biol. Chem., 257: 286-288 (1982) via a disulfide-interchange reaction. An anti-neoplastic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, or a chemotherapeutic agent (such as Doxorubicin) is optionally also contained within the liposome. See, Gabizon et al, J. National Cancer Inst., 81(19): 1484 (1989).\n\n\nIV. Therapeutic Methods Using Anti-α5βl Antibodies\n\n\n[00205] Any of the anti-α5βl antibodies provided herein may be used in therapeutic methods. It is understood that any of the formulations or therapeutic methods described herein may be use an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti- α5βl antibody.\n\n\n[00206] In one aspect, an anti-α5βl antibody for use as a medicament is provided. In further aspects, an anti-α5βl antibody for use in treating diseases and disorders involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage, including, for example, cancer, ocular diseases, and immune disorders {e.g., autoimmune disorders) is provided. In certain embodiments, an anti-α5βl antibody for use in a method of treatment is provided. In certain embodiments, the invention provides an anti-α5βl antibody for use in a method of \n\n treating an individual having a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of the anti-α5βl antibody. In one such embodiment, the method further comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of at least one, two, three, four, or more additional therapeutic agent(s), including, e.g., an antiangiogenic agent, an anti-neoplastic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, or a chemotherapeutic agent as described herein. In further embodiments, the invention provides an anti-α5βl antibody for use in inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. In certain embodiments, the invention provides an anti-α5βl antibody for use in a method of inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage in an individual comprising administering to the individual an effective of the anti-α5βl antibody to inhibit abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. An \"individual\" according to any of the above embodiments is preferably a human.\n\n\n[00207] In a further aspect, the invention provides for the use of an anti-α5βl antibody in the manufacture or preparation of a medicament. In one embodiment, the medicament is for treatment of a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage In a further embodiment, the medicament is for use in a method of treating a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage comprising administering to an individual having a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage an effective amount of the medicament. In one such embodiment, the method further comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of at least one, two, three, four, or more additional therapeutic agent(s) including, e.g., an antiangiogenic agent, an anti-neoplastic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, or a chemotherapeutic agent as described herein. In a further embodiment, the medicament is for inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. In a further embodiment, the medicament is for use in a method of inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage in an individual comprising administering to the individual an amount effective of the medicament to inhibit abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. An \"individual\" according to any of the above embodiments may be a human.\n\n\n[00208] In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for treating a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to an individual having such a disease or disorder involving abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage an \n\n effective amount of an anti-α5βl antibody. In one such embodiment, the method further comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of at least one additional therapeutic agent, as described below. An \"individual\" according to any of the above embodiments may be a human.\n\n\n[00209] In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage in an individual. In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of an anti-α5βl antibody to inhibit abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability or leakage. In one embodiment, an \"individual\" is a human.\n\n\n[00210] In a further aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising any of the anti-α5βl antibodies provided herein, e.g., for use in any of the above therapeutic methods. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the anti-α5βl antibodies provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the anti-α5βl antibodies provided herein and at least one additional therapeutic agent, e.g. , as described herein.\n\n\n[00211] Combination therapies described herein encompass combined administration (where two, three, four, or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.\n\n\n[00212] In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a VEGF antagonist (e.g., an anti-VEGF antibody such as, for example, bevacizumab). In some embodiments, the anti-α5βl antibodies are administered in combination with a VEGF antagonist. The anti-α5βl antibody and additional agent (e.g., a VEGF antagonist) can be administered concurrently or sequentially. Alternatively, the subject can be treated with the VEGF antagonist and subsequently administered the α5βl antagonist, e.g., treating with the VEGF antagonist until the subject is unresponsive to VEGF antagonist treatment and then treating the subject is treated with an α5βl antagonist. According to one embodiment, the subject is treated with the VEGF antagonist when the cancer is non-invasive and then treated with the α5βl antagonist when the cancer is invasive. Some patients who experience elevated α5βl levels naturally or in response to VEGF antagonist therapy, compared to non- diseased patients or control, can be especially responsive to this combination treatment. Combinations further comprising a therapeutic agent (e.g., an anti-neoplastic agent, a \n\n chemotherapeutic agent, a growth inhibitory agent and a cytotoxic agent) are contemplated. For example, patients who are to be treated with chemotherapy (e.g., irinotecan) and α5βl antagonists, or who have been treated with chemotherapy and α5βl antagonists, can benefit from VEGF antagonist therapy. Alternatively, patients who have been treated with chemotherapy and VEGF antagonists can benefit from α5βl antagonist therapy. In one embodiment, the anti-VEGF antibody is bevacizumab. In another embodiment, the anti- α5βl antibody is an anti-α5βl antibody described herein.\n\n\n[00213] An antibody of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. Various dosing schedules including but not limited to single or multiple administrations over various time-points, bolus administration, and pulse infusion are contemplated herein.\n\n\n[00214] Antibodies of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate.\n\n\n[00215] For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on \n\n the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. O.lmg/kg-lOmg/kg) of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n[00216] Depending on the indication to be treated and factors relevant to the dosing that a physician of skill in the field would be familiar with, the antibodies of the invention will be administered at a dosage that is efficacious for the treatment of that indication while minimizing toxicity and side effects.\n\n\n[00217] Cancer treatments can be evaluated by, e.g., but not limited to, tumor regression, tumor weight or size shrinkage, time to progression, duration of survival, progression free survival, overall response rate, duration of response, quality of life, protein expression and/or activity. Because the anti-angiogenic agents described herein target the tumor vasculature and not necessarily the neoplastic cells themselves, they represent a unique class of anticancer drugs, and therefore can require unique measures and definitions of clinical responses to drugs. For example, tumor shrinkage of greater than 50% in a 2- dimensional analysis is the standard cut-off for declaring a response. However, the α5βl antagonists and VEGF antagonists of the invention may cause inhibition of metastatic spread without shrinkage of the primary tumor, or may simply exert a tumouristatic effect. Accordingly, approaches to determining efficacy of the therapy can be employed, including for example, measurement of plasma or urinary markers of angiogenesis and measurement of response through radiological imaging.\n\n\n[00218] Evaluation of treatments for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) includes, but it is not limited to, a decrease in the rate of further vision loss or the prevention of further vision loss. For AMD therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be measured by \n\n one or more of the following: assessing the mean change in the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to a desired time, assessing the proportion of subjects who lose fewer than 15 letters in visual acuity at a desired time compared with baseline, assessing the proportion of subjects who gain greater than or equal to 15 letters in visual acuity at a desired time compared with baseline, assessing the proportion of subjects with a visual-acuity Snellen equivalent of 20/2000 or worse at desired time, assessing the NEI Visual Functioning Questionnaire, assessing the size of CNV and amount of leakage of CNV at a desired time, as assessed by fluorescein angiography, and the like.\n\n\nV. Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n[00219] The anti-α5βl antibodies can be formulated with suitable carriers or excipients so that they are suitable for administration. Suitable formulations of the antibodies are obtained by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as olyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Exemplary antibody formulations are described in WO98/56418, expressly incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carriers herein further include insterstitial drug dispersion agents such as soluble neutral-active hyaluronidase glycoproteins (sHASEGP), for example, human soluble PH-20 hyaluronidase glycoproteins, such as rHuPH20 (HYLENEX\n®\n, Baxter International, Inc.). Certain exemplary sHASEGPs and methods of use, including rHuPH20, are described in US Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0260186 and 2006/0104968. In one aspect, a sHASEGP is combined with one or more \n\n additional glycosaminoglycanases such as chondroitinases. Lyophilized formulations adapted for subcutaneous administration are described in WO97/04801. Such lyophilized formulations may be reconstituted with a suitable diluent to a high protein concentration and the reconstituted formulation may be administered subcutaneously to the mammal to be treated herein.\n\n\n[00220] The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide an anti-neoplastic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, a cytotoxic agent, and/or a chemotherapeutic agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disease or disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.\n\n\n[00221] The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n[00222] Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antagonist, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.\n\n\n[00223] Lipofectins or liposomes can be used to deliver the polypeptides and antibodies or compositions of this invention into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target \n\n protein is preferred. For example, based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., Marasco et al, PNAS USA, 90: 7889-7893 (1993).\n\n\n[00224] The active ingredients can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra.\n\n\n[00225] Sustained-release preparations can be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L- glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT ™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they can denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37°C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thio-disulfϊde interchange, stabilization can be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n[00226] The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. VI. Methods of Diagnosis and Imaging Using Anti-α5βl Antibodies\n\n\n[00227] Labeled anti-α5βl antibodies, and derivatives and analogs thereof, which \n\n specifically bind to an α5βl polypeptide can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases and/or disorders associated with the expression, aberrant expression and/or activity of α5βl. For example, the anti-α5βl antibodies of the invention can be used in in situ, in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro diagnostic assays or imaging assays.\n\n\n[00228] Methods for detecting expression of an α5βl polypeptide, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide in cells {e.g., tissue) or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies of this invention and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.\n\n\n[00229] Additional embodiments of the invention include methods of diagnosing a disease or disorder associated with expression or aberrant expression of α5βl in an animal {e.g., a mammal such as a human). The methods comprise detecting α5βl molecules in the mammal. In one embodiment, after administering a VEGF antagonist, diagnosis comprises: (a) administering an effective amount of a labeled anti- α5βl antibody to a mammal (b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled α5βl antibody to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the α5βl molecule is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); (c) determining background level; and (d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with expression or aberrant expression of α5βl. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.\n\n\n[00230] Anti-α5βl antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohisto logical methods known to those of skill in the art {e.g., see Jalkanen, et ah, J. Cell. Biol. 101 :976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, et ah, J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (\n131\n I, \n125\n 1, \n123\n I, \n121\n 1), carbon (\n14\n C), sulfur (\n35\n S), tritium (\n3\n H), indium (\n115m\nIn, \n113m\n In, \n112\n In, \nm\n In), and technetium (\" Tc, \n99m\n Tc), thallium (\n201\n Ti), gallium (\n68\n Ga, \n67\n Ga), palladium (\n103\n Pd), molybdenum (\" Mo), xenon (\n133\n Xe), fluorine (\n18\n F), \n153\n Sm, \nm\n Lu, \n159\n Gd, \n149\n Pm, \n140\n La, \n175\n Yb, \n166\n Ho, \n90\n Y, \n47\n Sc, \n186\n Re, \n188\n Re, \n142\n Pr, \n105\n Rh, \n97\n Ru; luminol; and fluorescent labels, \n\n such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.\n\n\n[00231] Techniques known in the art may be applied to labeled antibodies of the invention. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of bifunctional conjugating agents (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,065; 5,714,631; 5,696,239; 5,652,361; 5,505,931; 5,489,425; 5,435,990; 5,428,139; 5,342,604; 5,274,119; 4,994,560; and 5,808,003).\n\n\n[00232] According to one specific embodiment, α5βl polypeptide expression or overexpression is determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay after administration of a VEGF antagonist therapeutic agent by evaluating levels of α5βl present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay using anti- α5βl antibodies). Alternatively, or additionally, one can measure levels of α5βl polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or mRNA in the cell, e.g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization using a nucleic acid based probe corresponding to an α5βl -encoding nucleic acid or the complement thereof; (FISH; see WO98/45479 published October, 1998), Southern blotting, Northern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). One can also study α5βl overexpression by measuring shed antigen in a biological fluid such as serum, e.g., using antibody-based assays (see also, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,933,294 issued June 12, 1990; WO91/05264 published April 18, 1991; U.S. Patent 5,401,638 issued March 28, 1995; and Sias et al, J. Immunol. Methods 132:73-80 (1990)). Aside from the above assays, various in vivo and ex vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one can expose cells within the body of the mammal to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g., a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to the can be evaluated, e.g., by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a sample {e.g., a biopsy or other biological sample) taken from a mammal previously exposed to the antibody. VII. Articles of Manufacture and Kits\n\n\n[00233] Another embodiment of the invention is an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of cancer (e.g. tumors), ocular disease (e.g., wet AMD) or autoimmune diseases and related conditions. The article of manufacture can comprise a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. Generally, the container holds a composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a VEGF antagonist or an α5βl antagonist or an VEGF agonist or an α5βl agonist of the \n\n invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the particular condition.

BIAcore Analysis:\n\n\n[00239] To determine binding kinetics and affinities of the antibodies described herein, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SRP) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 instrument was used. Antibody was first captured by pre-immobilized rabbit anti-human Fc CM5 biosensor chip on the different flow cell to achieve approximately 150 RU (Response Units). For kinetics measurements, 2-fold serial dilutions of human integrin α5βl (300 nM to 1.2 nM) were injected in PBT buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) at 25°C with a flow rate of 30μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (£\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K\n∑\n,) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n.\n\n\nB. Fibronectin Binding Assay with U937 cells\n\n\n[00240] 100 μl of 10 μg/ml Fibronectin (R & D Systems) diluted in PBS pH 7.4 was added to the wells of 96-well plates (Nucn MaxiSorp) and incubated overnight at 2-8\n0\nC. Plates were washed 3 times with 200 μL PBS pH 7.4. 200 μl PBS pH 7.4/1 %BSA was added to all wells and the plates were incubated for at least 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation. Plates were washed 3 times with 200 μL PBS pH 7.4.\n\n\n[00241] 50 μl of diluted anti-α5βl antibody was added to each well (lOμg/mL serially diluted 1 :3 10 times), immediately followed by 50 μl U937 cells (ATCC, Cat#CRL- 1593.2) at a concentration of 1x10\n6\n cells/mL in Assay Media (RPMI 1640 (Media Prep A0806), 5 mg/mL BSA, ImM L-glutamine, ImM MgCl\n2\n).\n\n\n[00242] Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\n0\nC, unbound cells were discarded and the plates were washed with twice with 150 μL Assay Media. 100 μl of Assay Media and 100 μl of Cell-Titer Glow (Promega Cat#G7573) were added to each well. The plates were incubated for 10-15 minutes at room temperature, covered. Luminescence was detected on a\n\n\nVICTOR \n2\nV (Perkin-Elmer) plate reader and the luminescence units were analyzed relative to \n\n the concentration of the antibodies used in the assay, using a four-parameter nonlinear least squares fit, to obtain the IC \n50\n values.\n\n\nC . Fibronectin Binding Assay with α5 β 1\n\n\n[00243] 25 μl of 1 μg/ml Fibronectin (R & D Systems) diluted in PBS, was added to the wells of 384-well plates (Nucn MaxiSorp) and incubated overnight at 2-8\n0\nC. Plates were washed 3 times with 80 μL PBT buffer. 50 μl PBS/1 %BSA was added to all wells, the plates were incubated for at least 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation, then washed 3 times with 80 μL PBT buffer.\n\n\n[00244] anti-α5βl antibody (30 μg/mL) was serially diluted 1 :3 11 times. 50 μl of the serially diluted anti-α5β 1 antibody was added to 0.65 mL micro tubes and premixed (1 :1) with 50 μL of 200 ng/niL α5βl (R & D Systems) in ELISA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM MnCl\n2\n) for 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation. 25 μL of the premixed α5βl and anti-α5βl antibody was added to the Fibronectin coated wells and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes with gentle agitation. Plates were washed 6 times with PBT buffer, 100 ng/mL anti-βl-biotin in ELISA buffer was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation. Plates were washed 6 times with 80 μL PBT buffer, 25 μL of Streptadvidin-HRP (1 :50,000 in ELISA buffer, GE Healthcare) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation. Plates were washed 6 times with 80 μL PBT buffer, 25 μL of TMB substrate (Kirkgaard and Perry Laboratories) was added to each well, plates were incubated about 6 minutes at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped with 25 μL of 1 M Phosphoric Acid. Absorbance was read at 450 nm and IC\n50\n values were analyzed as described in section B above.\n\n\nD. HUVEC Migration Assay\n\n\n[00245] HUVEC cells were grown in standard media to 80% confluency. The cells were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in EBM-2 media with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 5 x 10\n5\n cells/ml. For the assay, 100 μl of cells (5 x 10\n4\n cells/well) were plated per well in a BD Falcon HTS Multiwell System 24 well (BD Ref: 351185, Pore size 8 μm). The HTS plates were pre-coated with Fibronectin (1-2 μg/ml) overnight. The plates were washed with PBS and 500μl (EBM with 0.1% BSA) solution was added to the bottom chamber. For each sample, 3 - 6 wells were used. No migration stimulus (e.g., VEGF) was added to the negative control well. \n\n [00246] To start the assay, lOOμl of cells (5 x 10\n4\n cells/well) were added to the upper chamber . The lower chamber contained 500 μl of media (EBM with 0.1% BSA). Anti- integrin α5βl antibodies and isotype controls are generally added to the upper chamber with the cells at a final concentration of 0 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml or 5 μg/ml, and incubated for 15 minutes before the migration stimulus (VEGF) was added to the lower chamber.\n\n\n[00247] Stimulus was added to the lower chamber (10 ng/ml VEGF-A), and plates were incubated 4-6 hours, or overnight. Cells were scraped from the upper chamber using a sponge swab, PBS was added, then the cells from the upper chamber were scraped again. The media was drained from the lower chamber and the cells were fixed with 500 μl of 100% methanol for 5 minutes.\n\n\n[00248] The cells were then stained with 500 μl SYTOX® Green nuclei acid stain (1 :5000 or 1 : 10000 dilution in PBS) (Molecular Probes S7020) for at least 10 min (in the dark). Then, a microscope was used to take individual pictures of each well. Pictures were taking using an Axio Vision AC program and a 5x objective.\n\n\n[00249] ImageJ was used to analyze the results (minimum 5 pixels, bin 5). The number of cells per well was recorded and analyzed using Microsoft Excel.\n\n\nExample 2: Generation of Anti-α5βl Antibodies\n\n\n[00250] Anti α5βl antibodies were generated by immunizing hamsters with recombinant human α5βl extracellular domain polypeptides. Hamster monoclonal antibody clone 18Cl 2 comprising the VH and VL sequences set forth in Figures 1 and 2 was selected.\n\n\n[00251] Two versions of chimeric hamster 18C12, hl8C12.vl.l and hl8C12.v2.1, were generated by cloning the light chain from the hamster 18C12 into two consensus VL\nkappa\ni/VHπi frameworks: hl8C12.vl.l and hl8C12.v2.1 which differ only in the CDR-H3 contact region. Specifically, the CDR-H3 contact region of hi 8Cl 2. v 1.1 comprises the following residues: C\n92\nA\n93\nR\n94\n and the CDR-H3 contact region of hl8C12.v2.1 comprises the following residues: C\n92\nT\n93\nS\n94\n. Both hl8C12.vl.l and hl8C12.v2.1 were successfully displayed on phage in Fab format and binding was observed by phage competition ELISA. No significant differences in binding were observed between hi 8C 12.vl .1 and hi 8C 12.v2.1. hl8C12.vl.l was selected for further humanization. Humanized 18C12.v3 was generated by changing most of the light chain framework of hl8C12.vl.l into the human consensus lambda IV framework with the exception of the following residues in the light chain: Y36, A43, and Y49. In addition, the following residues in the human VHm framework: G49 and D73 were retained. \n\n [00252] hl8C12.v3 was affinity matured and the following clones were generated: hl8C12.v6; hl8C12.v7; hl8C12.v9; hl8C12.vl5; hl8C12.vl6; hl8C12.v28; hl8C12.v30; hl8C12.v51; hl8C12.v54; hl8C12.v70; hl8C12.v78. CDR sequences for each of the clones are set forth in Figure 3. CDR sequences for the hl8C12.v6 clone were modified as follows: CDR-L2: D50cS and D56S; CDR-Hl : N3 IA; and CDR-H2: N53A. The modified CDR sequences were then inserted into a modified human λIII//VHIII framework to generate hl8C12.v6.1Lam3 (hl8C12.v6.1) and hl8C12.v6.2Lam3 (hl8C12.v6.2). The modified human λlll framework for hl8C12.v6.1 contained the following modifications: L46Y; V47L; I48M; N69A; A71R; and G77N. The modified human λlll framework for hl8C12.v6.2 contained the following modifications: N69A; A71R; and G77N. The modified VHIII framework contained the following modifications: S49G and N73D.\n\n\n[00253] Clone hl8C12.v6.1 was further modified to remove Asparagine (N) in CDR- L2 (N\nSOa\ng\nSOb\ng\nSOc\nQ\nSOd\n) \nτhe following clones were\n g\nenera\nted: hl8C12.v6.1.1; hl8C12.v6.1.2; hl8C12.v6.1.3; hl8C12.v6.1.4; and hl8C12.v6.1.5. The CDR-L2 sequence at positions 50a, 50b, 50c, and 5Od for each of the hl8C12.v6.1 clones is set forth in Figure 7.\n\n\nExample 3: Phage Competition ELISA\n\n\n[00254] MAXISORP™ microtiter plates were coated with recombinant human integrin α5βl (R&D) at 5 μg/ml in PBS overnight and then blocked with PBST buffer (0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for an hour at room temperature. Phage from culture supernatants were incubated with serially diluted human integrin α5β 1 in PBST buffer in a tissue-culture microtiter plate for an hour, after which 80 μl of the mixture was transferred to the target-coated wells for 15 minutes to capture unbound phage. The plate was washed with PBT buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), and HRP-conjugated anti-M13 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added (1 :5000 in PBST buffer) for 40 minutes. The plate was washed with PBT buffer and developed by adding tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The absorbance at 450 nm was plotted as a function of target concentration in solution to determine phage IC50. This was used as an affinity estimate for the Fab clone displayed on the surface of the phage. Figure 4 depicts results from a phage competition assay demonstrating the binding of the affinity matured 18C12 variants hl8C12.v3; hl8C12.v6; hl8C12.v7; hl8C12.v9; hl8C12.vl5; hl8C12.vl6; hl8C12.v28; hl8C12.v30; hl8C12.v51; hl8C12.v54; hl8C12.v70; and hl8C12.v78 to human α5βl integrin. \n\n Example 4: Antibody affinity determinations by BIAcore\n\n\n[00255] To determine binding kinetics and affinities of chimeric 18C12, hl8C12.v6.1, hl8C12.v6.1.1, hl8C12.v6.1.2, hl8C12.v6.1.3, hl8C12.v6.1.4, hl8C12.v6.1.5 IgGs, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SRP) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 instrument as described in Example 1 was used.\n\n\n[00256] Figure 5 depicts results from BIAcore analysis of the binding of affinity matured 18C12 variants to human α5βl integrin. Figure 6 depicts results from BIACore analysis of the binding of chimeric 18C12 (18C12 comprising the hamster VL and VH sequences set forth in Figure 1 and the Fc portion of IgGl) and hl8C12.v6.1 to human α5βl integrin. The data demonstrate that hl8C12.v6.1 has a binding affinity for human α5βl integrin that is approximately 2 times higher than the binding affinity of hamster 18Cl 2 for human α5βl integrin. Figure 7 depicts results from BIAcore analysis for each of the hl8C12.v6.1 clones.\n\n\nExample 5: 18C12 Antibodies Inhibit Binding to Fibronectin\n\n\n[00257] To compare the effects of chimeric 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1 or hl8C12.v6.1.5 IgGs on binding to fibronectin, the fibronectin binding assays described in Example 1 above was used.\n\n\n[00258] Figure 8 depicts the results of a fibronectin binding assay comparing the ability of chimeric 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1 to interfere with the binding of U937 cells to fibronectin. Figure 9 depicts the results of a fibronectin binding assay comparing the ability of hamster 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1.5 to interfere with the binding of U937 cells to fibronectin. Figure 10 depicts the results of a fibronectin binding assay comparing the ability of hamster 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1.5 to interfere with the binding of recombinant αsβi extracellular domain to fibronectin. The data demonstrate that hamster 18C12, chimeric 18C 12, hi 8C12.v6.1, and hi 8C12.v6.1.5 inhibit binding of U937 cells or recombinant α\n5\nβi extracellular domain to fibrinectin.\n\n\nExample 6: 18C12 Antibodies Inhibit HUVEC Migration\n\n\n[00259] To compare the effects of chimeric 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1 IgGs on migration of HUVEC cells, the HUVEC migration assay described in Example 1 above was used.\n\n\n[00260] Figure 11 depicts the results of a HUVEC migration assay comparing the ability of chimeric 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1 to interfere with migration of HUVEC cells on \n\n fϊbronectin. The data demonstrate that chimeric 18C12 and hl8C12.v6.1 inhibit migration of HUVEC cells on fϊbrinectin.\n\n\nExample 7: Embryonic Development Assays\n\n\n[00261] α5 transgenic mice expressing a chimeric α5βl integrin (human α5 and murine βl) were used in embryonic development assays to demonstrate the efficacy of the 18C12 antibodies described herein. Male transgenic mice expressing human α5 and no murine α5 were mated to female mice not expressing human α5 and heterozygous for murine α5. Pregnant mice were injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg anti-α5βl antibody (hl8C12.v6.1.5) or with a negative control antibody 2x/ week starting at 9.5 days post-coitum. At day 14.5 post- coitum, the embryos were collected, genotyped, and embryonic vasculature was evaluated. The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results demonstrate that hl8C12.v6.1.5 disrupts α5βl integrin function in vivo during vascular development.\n\n\nExample 8: Tumor Allograft Assays\n\n\n[00262] C57/B16 allograft tumor models are used in studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the 18C12 antibodies described herein. C57/B16 tumor cells are implanted into murine α5 knockout: :human α5 transgenic mice and the mice are treated with anti-α5βl antibodies.\n\n\n[00263] Mice bearing established tumors are randomized into four groups, so that all the groups have similar starting tumor volumes. The dosing regimen is as follows:\n\n\n(1) Negative control antibody (13.5 mg/kg, 2x/week)\n\n\n(2) Anti-VEGF antibody (3.5 mg/kg, 2x/week) + Negative control antibody (10 mg/kg, 2x/week)\n\n\n(3) Negative control antibody (3.5 mg/kg, 2x/week) + anti-α5βl antibody (18Cl 2) (10 mg/kg, 2x/week)\n\n\n(4) Anti-VEGF antibody (3.5 mg/kg, 2x/week) + anti-α5βl antibody (18C12) (10 mg/kg, 2x/week) \n\n [00264] The length and width of tumors are measured twice per week using calipers, and tumor volumes calculated using this formulus: Tumor Volume (mm\n3\n) = (w\n2\n x l)/2, where w = width and / = length in mm. Tumor volumes are plotted against time to reflect tumor growth rates.\n\n\nExample 9: Tumor Xenograft Assays\n\n\n[00265] Tumor xenograft assays were used in studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the 18Cl 2 antibodies described herein. Human U87 glioma cells harbouring a luciferase reporter gene are implanted into the brains of nude mice and the mice are treated with anti- α5βl antibodies.\n\n\n[00266] Mice bearing established tumors were imaged using bioluminescence imaging and randomized into three groups, so that all the groups had a similar starting tumor burden. The dosing regimen was as follows:\n\n\n(1) Negative control antibodies (ragweed) (5 mg/kg, 2x/week) + anti-gD (10 mg/kg, 2x/week)\n\n\n(2) Anti-VEGF antibody (B20-4.1) (5 mg/kg, 2x/week) + negative control antibody anti-gD (10 mg/kg, 2X/week)\n\n\n(3) Anti-VEGF antibody (B20-4.1) (5 mg/kg, 2x/week) + anti-α5βl antibody (hl8C12.v6.1.5) (10 mg/kg, 2x/week)\n\n\n[00267] The survival of these mice was monitored daily following surgical implantation of tumor cells. Treatment with the anti-α5βl antibody hl8C12.v6.1.5 in combination with anti-VEGF significantly enhanced the survival of mice relative to anti- VEGF alone. The results are shown in Figure 12. Tumor burdens were also measured at weeks 1, 3, 4, and 5 following implantation using bioluminescence imaging. Mice treated with the anti-α5βl antibody hl8C12.v6.1.5 in combination with anti-VEGF had a reduced tumor burden relative to mice treated with anti-VEGF alone. The results are shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n[00268] All publications (including, e.g., patents, published patent applications, and Genbank Accession Nos.) cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes as if each reference were specifically and individually incorporated by reference."

Description\n\n\n\n\n METHODS FOR DIAGNOSING CANCER AND DETERMINING THE OVERALL SURVIVAL AND DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL OF CANCER PATIENTS.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nField of Invention\n\n\n[0001] The invention generally relates to diagnostic and monitoring methods and assays for cancer and kits that may be used in such methods. More particularly, the application relates to the use of GP88 expression for predicting the likelihood of metastasis, length of disease-free survival and length of overall survival of cancer patients and the outcome of cancer therapies.\n\n\nRelated Art\n\n\n[0002] Breast cancer is the leading form of cancer in women, and the second leading cause after lung cancer of cancer deaths in the United States. In the industrialized world, about one woman in every nine can expect to develop breast cancer in her lifetime. In the United States, the annual incidence of breast cancer is about 180,000 new cases and approximately 48,000 deaths each year (Parkin 1998; Apantaku 2000). Approximately two million women living in the United States alone have been diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives. Despite ongoing improvements in understanding the disease, breast cancer has remained to a large extent resistant to medical intervention. Most clinical initiatives are focused on early diagnosis, followed by conventional forms of intervention, particularly surgery, radiation, hormone suppression, and chemotherapy. Such interventions are of limited success, particularly in patients where the tumor has undergone metastasis. There is a pressing need to improve the arsenal of diagnostic tools and methods available to provide more precise and more effective information that will allow successful treatment in the least invasive way possible. Specifically, markers that can identify patients with very low risk of disease reappearance, metastasis, and death after initial surgery would reduce the extent of over treatment with expensive and potentially toxic supplementary regimes. The invention meets that need by providing new methods and markers for monitoring breast cancer. \n\n [0003] Among the large group of breast cancer patients with localized tumors and without detectable metastases to nearby lymph nodes, many will be cured by surgery because the tumors have not metastasized to surrounding tissues and lymph nodes. However, others have occult metastatic disease and could benefit from supplementary radiation or adjuvant anti-hormone therapy or chemotherapy. There is a need for diagnostic markers to discriminate between tumors with low risk for metastatic metastasis and those with higher risk. Tumor markers that signify low risk of metastatic disease may directly affect the therapeutic decision of whether to use supplementary radiation or adjuvant hormone or chemotherapy. Furthermore, such tumor markers may also affect the surgeon's recommendation of whether to choose breast conserving surgery or mastectomy.\n\n\nDiagnosis of Breast Cancer\n\n\n[0004] The definitive diagnosis of all types of breast disease is based on histologic evaluation of tissue samples using the light microscope. The histologic criteria used to define most breast lesions are historic but nonetheless quite reproducible for identifying fully invasive breast cancers. Recent accomplishments include the identification of a small number of tissue-based biomarkers that are helpful in predicting clinical outcome and response to therapy (e.g., S-phase fraction, estrogen and progesterone receptors, c- erbB-2) and the discovery of genes (BRCA-I and BRC A-2) associated with familial risk for breast cancers (Dahiya and Deng 1998; Fitzgibbons, Page et al. 2000).\n\n\n[0005] The molecular basis of cancer is still being determined. Ln breast cancer, receptors for estrogen and progesterone are related to the state of mammary epithelial cell differentiation and have prognostic value for disease outcome in certain cases. Estrogen is known to be a primary stimulator for estrogen receptor (ER) positive human breast cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro. Although estrogen is initially required for establishment and proliferation of breast tumors, the development of estrogen- independent tumors during the course of breast cancer is indicative of poor prognosis. It has been postulated that the mitogenic effect of estrogen in breast cancer cells is mediated, at least partially, by autocrine growth factors, including growth factors regulated by estrogen. Thus, the identification and characterization of estrogen- \n\n responsive genes, particularly genes encoding growth factors, contributes to the understanding of the effects of estrogen in breast cancer cells.\n\n\n[0006] However, diagnosing breast cancer still requires some type of biopsy procedure.\n\n\nIn addition, current diagnostic and prognostic methods cannot absolutely distinguish breast cancers that are treatable by surgery alone from those that are likely to reappear or have already metastasis through metastases. As a result, at least 50 percent of breast cancer patients are treated with some form of adjuvant therapy. Moreover, available methods are inadequate for predicting the response of breast cancers to specific types of adjuvant therapies.\n\n\n[0007] Treatment decisions for individuals afflicted with breast cancer are frequently based on the number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PR) status, size of the primary tumor, and stage of disease at diagnosis (Tandon, Clark et al. 1989). However, even with this variety of factors, it is currently not possible to predict accurately the course of disease. There is clearly a need to identify new markers in order to separate patients with good prognosis, who might need no supplementary therapy beyond surgical removal of the malignant breast tumor, from those whose cancer is more likely to reappear and who might benefit from additional and more exhaustive treatment forms.\n\n\n[0008] There remain deficiencies in the art with respect to the identification of markers linked with the progression of breast cancer, the development of diagnostic methods to monitor disease progression and the development of therapeutic methods and compositions to treat breast diseases and cancers. The identification of markers which are differentially expressed or activated in breast cancer would be of considerable importance in the development of a rapid, inexpensive method to improve diagnosing of breast cancer and to predict tumor behavior with respect to patient prognosis and responsiveness to individual therapeutic options.\n\n\nGP88\n\n\n[0009] The 88 kDa glycoprotein PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) is an autocrine growth factor, first isolated from the elevatedly tumorigenic mouse teratoma PC cells. PCDGF also known in the art as GP88, Granulin-Epithelin Precursor (GEP), Granulin \n\n Precursor, Progranulin, Epithelin Precursor, Proepithelin (PEPI) and Acrogranin (herein after referred to as GP88), is the largest member of the granulin/epithelin family of cysteine-rich polypeptide growth modulators. It has been reported that GP88 stimulated the proliferation and survival of several cell types of mesenchymal and epithelial origin by stimulating MAP kinase, PI-3 kinase and FAK kinase pathways. Interestingly, over- expression of GP88 was found in several cancer cell lines and/or tumor tissues including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma and glioblastoma.\n\n\n[0010] In breast cancer cells, GP88 has been shown to play a critical role in tumorigenesis. GP88 over-expression correlated positively with the acquisition of estrogen-independent growth, tamoxifen resistance and tumorigenicity. Inhibition of GP88 expression by antisense cDNA transfection in MDA-MB-468 cells resulted in a complete inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, it was demonstrated that GP88 prevented the apoptotic effect of tamoxifen in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. Pathological studies with breast carcinoma biopsies revealed that GP88 was expressed in 80% invasive ductal carcinoma in correlation with poor prognosis markers such as tumor grade, p53 expression and Ki67 index whereas benign lesions were mostly negative. In addition, pathological studies in ovarian tumors indicated that GP88 was elevatedly expressed in invasive epithelial ovarian tumors when compared with tumors with low malignant potential. These studies demonstrate that GP88 plays a role in invasion in addition to stimulating proliferation of tumor cells.\n\n\n[0011] Granulins/epithelins (\"grn/epi\") are 6 kDa polypeptides and belong to a novel family of double cysteine rich polypeptides. U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,192 (Shoyab et al.) is directed to 6 kDa epithelins, particularly epithelin 1 and epithelin 2. According to Shoyab, both epithelins are encoded by a common 63.5 kDa precursor, which is processed into smaller forms as soon as it is synthesized, so that the only natural products found in biological samples are the 6 kDa forms. GP88 is this epithelin precursor, and Shoyab et al. teach that GP88 is biologically inactive.\n\n\n[0012] Contrary to the teachings of Shoyab et al., the present inventor's laboratory has demonstrated that the precursor is not always processed as soon as it is synthesized. Studies have demonstrated that the precursor (i.e., GP88) is in fact secreted as an 88 kDa \n\n glycoprotein with an N-linked carbohydrate moiety of 20 kDa. Analysis of the N- terminal sequence of GP88 indicates that GP88 starts at amino acid 17 of the grn/epi precursor, demonstrating that the first 17 amino acids from the protein sequence deduced from the precursor cDNA correspond to a signal peptide compatible with targeting for membrane localization or for secretion. In contrast to the teachings of Shoyab et al., GP88 is biologically active and has growth promoting activity, particularly as an autocrine growth factor for the producer cells.\n\n\n[0013] There remains a need in the art for markers linked with the progression of cancers\n\n\n(e.g., breast and lung cancers) and diagnostic methods for predicting disease progression based on such markers. These needs and others are met by the present invention.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0014] It has been discovered by the inventors that elevated levels of GP88 expression is associated with increased likelihood of metastasis, decreased overall survival, and decreased disease-free survival of patients afflicted with cancer (e.g., breast and lung cancer). This association was particularly strong for estrogen receptor negative (ER-), estrogen receptor positive and lymph node negative (ER+/LN-), and estrogen receptor positive and lymph node positive (ER+/LN+) breast cancers. Such an association was not known prior to the inventors' discovery. The inventors show that the presence of elevated GP88 expression in human breast cancer (particularly, in invasive ductal carcinoma) is associated with an increased likelihood of metastasis, a decreased disease- free and overall survival, and therefore, GP88 expression is a new and novel prognostic marker of breast cancer progression. Elevated levels of GP88 expression in the primary tumor(s) of patients is a strong positive prognostic factor.\n\n\n[0015] The inventors show that the presence of elevated GP88 expression in human lung cancer (particularly, in non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)) is associated with an increased likelihood of metastasis, a decreased disease-free and overall survival, and therefore, GP88 expression is a new and novel prognostic marker of lung cancer progression. Elevated levels of GP88 expression in the primary tumor(s) of patients is a strong positive prognostic factor. \n\n [0016] Levels of GP88 expression may be analyzed using any technique known to those in the art, for example, with antibodies or other compositions capable of binding GP88 (e.g., ligands, etc.,). Thus, the analysis of GP88 expression adds a new level of information to current cancer (e.g., breast and lung cancer) markers and is a reliable prognostic molecular/biochemical marker of cancer in samples from patients afflicted with cancer. Additionally, monitoring levels of GP88 expression is predictive of the outcome of effective therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.\n\n\n[0017] In accordance with the present invention, methods are provided for prognosis of length of disease-free or overall survival in a patient suffering from cancer. In one embodiment, it has been found that elevated levels of GP 88 expression show an unexpected and surprisingly elevated correlation to decreased length of disease-free and/or overall survival.\n\n\n[0018] Thus, the present invention advantageously provides a significant advancement in cancer management because early identification of patients at risk for tumor reappearance or metastasis will permit aggressive early treatment with significantly enhanced potential for survival.\n\n\n[0019] Alternatively, the instant invention provides methods for predicting the length of disease-free and overall survival; predicting progression-free survival, predicting event- free survival, predicting the risk of decreased disease- free or overall survival, predicting the likelihood of recovery of a patient suffering from cancer; predicting the likelihood of reappearance of cancer and/or metastasis in an individual having a cancer tumor; predicting the risk of reappearance of cancer, methods for screening a patient suffering from cancer to determine the risk of tumor metastasis; methods for determining the proper course of treatment for a patient suffering from cancer; methods for monitoring the effectiveness of a course of treatment for a patient suffering from cancer; and kits for use in practicing the invention methods.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0020] FIG. 1 shows Kaplan-Meier curves that were generated for ER- patients after prognostic classification based on staining with anti-GP88 antibody. \n\n [0021] Fig. 2 shows Kaplan-Meier curves that were generated for ER+/LN- patients after prognostic classification of disease-free survival based on staining with anti-GP88 antibody.\n\n\n[0022] FIG.3 shows Kaplan-Meier curves that were generated for ER+/LN- patients after prognostic classification of overall survival based on staining with anti-GP88 antibody.\n\n\n[0023] Fig. 4 shows Kaplan-Meier curves that were generated for ER+/LN+ patients after prognostic classification of disease-free survival based on staining with anti-GP88 antibody.\n\n\n[0024] FIG. 5 shows Kaplan-Meier curves that were generated for ER+/LN+ patients after prognostic classification of overall survival based on staining with anti-GP88 antibody.\n\n\n[0025] FIG. 6 shows Immunohistochemical detection of various levels of GP88 expression in normal and breast cancer tissues using an anti-GP88 antibody.\n\n\n[0026] FIG. 7 is a graph showing the optical density (y-axis) of samples containing known quantities of GP88 (x-axis).

Exemplary neoplastic diseases include carcinomas, such as adenocarcinomas and melanomas; and sarcomas, such as various leukemias or lymphomas. Of particular interest are cancers of breast, liver, kidney, testes, brain, ovary, skin, lung, prostate, thyroid, pancreas, cervix, colorectal, stomach, intestine, bladder, hematopoietic (lymphoid and myeloid), gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), genitourinary tract (e.g., renal, urothelial cells), uterine, head and neck and nasopharynx; particularly breast cancer, more particularly invasive ductal carcinoma. Still further examples of tumors include benign tumors including, but not limited to hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas; other malignancies such as most rectal cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, non- small cell carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the small intestine and cancer of the esophagus.

The phrase \"disease- free survival\" is well known to one of skill in the art and means living free of the disease being monitored. For example, if GP88 expression is used to diagnose or monitor breast cancer, disease-free survival would mean free from detectable breast cancer. The phrase \"likelihood of recovery\" is well known to one of skill in the art and refers to the probability of disappearance of tumor or lack of tumor reappearance resulting in the recovery of the patient subsequent to diagnosis of cancer, wherein the probability is determined according to the process of the invention. The phrase \"likelihood of reappearance\" is well known to one of skill in the art and refers to the probability of tumor reappearance or metastasis in a patient subsequent to diagnosis of cancer, wherein the probability is determined according to the process of the invention. The phrase \"event- free survival\" is well known to one of skill in the art and means living without the occurrence of a particular group of defined events (for example progression of cancer) after a particular action (e.g., treatment). The phrase \"Progression-free survival\" is well known to one of skill in the art and refers to the length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with a disease that does not get worse, and can be used in a clinical study or trial to help find out how well a treatment is working. The term \"metastasis\" is well known to one of skill in the art and refers to the growth of a cancerous tumor in an organ or body part, which is not directly connected to the organ of the original cancerous tumor. Metastasis will be understood to include micrometastasis, \n\n which is the presence of an undetectable amount of cancerous cells in an organ or body part which is not directly connected to the organ of the original cancerous tumor. Therefore, the present invention contemplates a method of determining the risk of further growth of one or more cancerous tumors in an organ or body part which is not directly connected to the organ of the original cancerous tumor.\n\n\n[0048] As used herein, the phrase \"biological sample\" encompasses a variety of sample types obtained from a subject and useful in the procedure of the invention. Biological samples may include, but are not limited to, solid tissue samples, liquid tissue samples, biological fluids, aspirates, cells and cell fragments. Specific examples of biological samples include, but are not limited to, solid tissue samples obtained by surgical removal, a pathology specimen, an archived sample, or a biopsy specimen, tissue cultures or cells derived therefrom and the progeny thereof, and sections or smears prepared from any of these sources. Non-limiting examples are samples obtained from breast tissue, lymph nodes, and breast tumors. Biological samples also include any material derived from the body of a vertebrate animal, including, but not limited to, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, plasma, urine, nipple aspirate, fine needle aspirate, tissue lavage such as ductal lavage, saliva, sputum, ascites fluid, liver, kidney, breast, bone, bone marrow, testes, brain, ovary, skin, lung, prostate, thyroid, pancreas, cervix, stomach, intestine, colorectal, brain, bladder, colon, uterine, semen, lymph, vaginal pool, synovial fluid, spinal fluid, head and neck, nasopharynx tumors, amniotic fluid, breast milk, pulmonary sputum or surfactant, urine, fecal matter and other liquid samples of biologic origin, and may refer to either the cells or cell fragments suspended therein, or to the liquid medium and its solutes. AU or a portion of the biological sample may have a level of GP88 expression characteristic of one or more disease state(s).\n\n\n[0049] As used herein, a \"standard\" is a reference that serves as a basis for comparison of other data. A standard may include a biological sample, photographs or photomicrographs of biological samples, or noπnal ranges (for example, within the range of healthy individuals) derived from an analysis of biological samples. For example, standards may include normal and/or cancer tissue, cancer-free tissue or an archived pathology sample containing GP88 protein expression at various levels for use as positive control, and tumor tissue or other tissue showing no GP88 expression levels as negative \n\n control samples, a photograph or photomicrographs, or normal ranges derived from said samples. For example, the photographs in Figure 6 can be considered as standards. Such standards may be used in methods, including but not limited to, for predicting the length of disease-free and overall survival, predicting progression-free survival, predicting the risk of decreased disease-free or overall survival, predicting the likelihood of recovery of a patient suffering from cancer, predicting the likelihood of reappearance of cancer and/or metastasis in an individual having a cancer tumor, predicting the risk of reappearance of cancer, methods for screening a patient suffering from cancer to determine the risk of tumor metastasis, methods for determining the proper course of treatment for a patient suffering from cancer and methods for monitoring the effectiveness of a course of treatment for a patient suffering from cancer.\n\n\n[0050] A \"GP88 binding composition\" may include any agent, including but not limited to ligands, anti-GP88 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, that is capable of specifically binding to GP88. As used herein, the term \"agent that binds to (or capable of binding to) GP88\" refers to any molecule that specifically binds to GP88 or polypeptide fragment thereof, including but not limited to, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, and thereby detects the levels of GP88 expression.

the effectiveness of a course of treatment for a patient suffering from cancer. This method comprises: a) determining a first level of GP88 expression in a biological sample from said patient prior to said treatment; and (b) subsequently determining a second level of GP88 expression in a biological sample from said patient during said treatment. Comparison of said first level of GP88 expression with said second level of GP88 expression will then indicate the effectiveness of said treatment.\n\n\n[0074] Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for screening a patient afflicted with cancer to determine the risk of tumor reappearance or tumor metastasis. The method comprises determining the levels of GP88 expression in a biological sample obtained from said patient, comparing said level to a standard. A patient found to have elevated levels of GP88, relative to a standard, is classified as being more likely to suffer tumor reappearance or tumor metastasis.\n\n\n[0075] A further preferred embodiment of the invention provides a method for determining the proper course of treatment for a patient suffering from cancer. This method comprises determining the levels of expression of GP88 in a biological sample obtained from a patient. Then, a first group of patients is identified as having low levels of expression of a GP88, which group of patients may require treatment proper for patients having a higher chance of survival or increased time to tumor reappearance or metastasis. The method further comprises identifying a second group of patients as having elevated levels of expression of a GP88, which group of patients may require \n\n treatment proper for patients having a lower chance of survival and being more likely to suffer tumor reappearance or metastasis.\n\n\n[0076] In yet another embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for the determination of levels of GP88 expression at an early stage of tumor development. Various stages of tumor development are well known to those of skill in the art, as exemplified in Markman 1997, Basic Cancer Medicine, for example.\n\n\n[0077] The invention is also directed to a method for determining the efficacy of breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) for treatment of node-negative breast cancer comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from an individual in need of breast conserving surgery, b) measuring the levels of GP88 expression in said biological sample; and c) comparing said levels to that of a standard to predict the responsiveness of said breast cancer to breast conserving surgery.\n\n\n[0078] Another embodiment of the invention provides methods for prognosis of a patient with cancer, comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from an individual in need of prognosis; b) determining the level of GP88 expression in a biological sample obtained from said patient; c) scoring said sample for GP88 expression levels; and d) comparing said scoring to that obtained from a control sample (or standard).\n\n\n[0079] The invention is also directed to a method for determining the effect of antiestrogen treatment comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from an individual in need of antiestrogen treatment, b) measuring the levels of GP88 expression in said biological sample; and c) comparing said levels to a standard to predict the responsiveness to antiestrogen treatment. This method may further comprise a step of determining the proper course of treatment for such patient according to the previously recited methods.\n\n\n[0080] As used herein, \"antiestrogen therapy\" relates to administration of antiestrogen composition for the purpose of preventing or treating tumor growth. Examples of antiestrogens include estrogen receptor antagonists or SERM (tamoxifen and raloxifene). Other antiestrogen compositions include, aromatase inhibitors (e.g., Arimidex® (anastrozole), Femera®), and estrogen receptor down-regulators (e.g., Faslodex®). The antiestrogenic effects of tamoxifen may be related to its ability to compete with estrogen \n\n for binding sites in target tissues. Other antiestrogens, such as aromatase inhibitors, inhibit or reduce the amount of estrogen available.\n\n\n[0081] The invention is also directed to a method for screening compounds comprising: a) obtaining compounds to be screened for their ability to positively or negatively affect GP88 expression; b) contacting a relevant biological sample with said compound; and c) determining the effect of said compound on the levels of GP88 expression in said biological sample. Preferably the effect of said compound may be determined by the binding of an antibody to GP88 to said sample relative to a standard.\n\n\nDetermininfi Levels of GP88 Expression\n\n\n[0082] Determination of GP88 expression may be performed by one or more of the methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, GP88 expression levels may be determined by detection of (a) a GP88 polypeptide, (b) mRNA encoding a GP88 protein, (c) a portion of DNA which constitutes a GP88 gene, or (d) any combination thereof.\n\n\n[0083] For example, levels of GP88 expression can be detected by measuring levels of\n\n\nGP88 protein using GP88 binding compositions. The detection of GP88 protein levels may be carried out using any of the methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art including, but not limited to, chemiluminescence methods, histochemical staining or biochemical detection (i.e., immuno-histochemistry assays), Western Blot analysis, flow cytometry, immuno-precipitation (or the equivalent thereof for non-antibody agents), Plasmon resonance absorbance measurement, and the like. In one embodiment of the invention, the method of detecting GP88 protein levels is an immunoassay (such as an ELISA), which includes the use of at least one antibody. In yet another embodiment of the invention, GP88 staining, in tissue sample for example, formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded tissue sections can be carried out by immuno-histochemistry using an anti- GP88 antibody, and determining the expression of GP88.\n\n\n[0084] For example, one embodiment of the invention was performed using the\n\n\nOncoStain 88™ IHC kit which uses a primary mouse monoclonal antibody, a secondary \n\n anti-mouse IgG antibody, a peroxidase blocker to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity and a chromogenic substrate. Measurement of the polypeptide encoded by a GP88 gene may include measurements of fragments of the polypeptide, wherein the fragments arise from transcriptional or translational variants of the gene; or alternatively, differently sized polypeptides arise as a result of post translational modifications including proteolysis of a larger portion of a GP88 polypeptide.\n\n\n[0085] Detection of levels of mRNA encoding GP88 may also serve as an indicator of\n\n\nGP88 expression. The methods used to detect mRNA levels are well known in the art, and include the detection of hybridization or amplification with the mRNA encoding GP88. This detection may be carried out by analysis of mRNA either in vitro or in situ (e.g., in a tissue sample) using one of the methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art as exemplified in the Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, 1999); in U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,864; and the like. A GP88 mRNA detected will be any RNA transcript of a GP 88 gene, or fragment thereof.\n\n\nClassification of Patients\n\n\n[0086] The patients can be classified by comparing the levels of GP88 expression in the biological sample obtained from a patient to a standard. For example, after measuring the GP88 expression level in the sample, the measured level is compared to a standard. This standard is a level of expression of GP88 used to evaluate the level of expression of GP88 in the biological sample of a patient. For example, in one embodiment, when the levels of GP88 expression in the patient sample are higher than that of the standard, the patient sample will be considered to have elevated levels of GP88 expression. Conversely, in another embodiment, when the levels of GP88 expression in the sample are lower than the standard, the sample will be considered to have low levels of GP88 expression.\n\n\n[0087] In another embodiment, patients can be assigned a \"score\" associated with the\n\n\nGP88 expression in a given biological sample. A sample may be \"scored\" during the diagnosis or monitoring of breast cancer. Scoring may be determined by the levels of expression of GP88 in a biological sample. In one embodiment, elevated levels of GP88 expression in a biological sample are given a higher score as compared to low levels of GP88 expression, which is given a comparatively lower score. Scoring may also be \n\n determined by visual examination of samples by immunohistochemistry. In another embodiment, more quantitative scoring involves determining the two or more parameters, for example (i) intensity of staining and (ii) the proportion of stained (\"positive\") cells that are sampled. Based on these multiple parameters scores may be assigned that reflect increasing levels of positive staining.\n\n\n[0088] Thus, in one embodiment, a score associated with the levels of GP88 expression in a biological sample obtained from a patient can be compared to the score associated with the levels of GP88 expression in the standard or to cells having no, low or elevated levels of GP88 expression used as controls. Such comparison may provide a basis for better prognosis of the patient. For example, in one embodiment, methods of the invention may score the levels of GP88 expression by using a scale of 0 to 3+, where 0 is negative (no detectable GP88 expression), 1+ and 2+ are associated with a weak and weak to moderate staining, respectively, and 3+ is associated with high intensity staining, in more than 10% of tumor cells; and wherein a lower score indicates a better prognosis of patients.\n\n\n[0089] Prognosis of patients expressing various levels of GP88 can be carried out using single variable or multi-variable analysis. These methods determine the likelihood of a correlation between one or more variables and a given outcome. In one embodiment, the methods will determine the likelihood of a correlation between GP88 expression levels (or GP88 expression levels coupled with another variable) and disease- free or overall survival of cancer patients. Any one of a plurality of methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art for carrying out these analyses may be used. An example of single variable analysis is the Kaplan-Meir method or the log-rank test. An example of multi- variable analysis is the Cox proportional-hazards regression model. The methods of the invention may further comprise analyzing the levels of GP88 expression in conjunction with additional breast cancer markers. Cox proportional ratio provides a hazard ration or a risk for disease-free and overall survival for patient with varying level of GP88 expression.\n\n\n[0090] Survival analysis using methods of Kaplan and Meier is the recommended statistical technique for use in cancer trials. It is applied by analyzing the distribution of \n\n patient survival times following their recruitment to a study. The analysis expresses these in terms of the proportion of patients still alive up to a given time following recruitment. In graphical terms, a plot of the proportion of patients surviving against time has a characteristic decline (often exponential), the steepness of the curve indicating the efficacy of the treatment being investigated. The more shallow the survival curve, the more effective the treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis can be used to test the statistical significance of differences between the survival curves associated with two different treatments.\n\n\n[0091] In one embodiment, after the levels of expression of GP88 in the sample obtained from a patient have been determined and compared to the standard, the patient is then classified into a group having a certain likelihood of disease-free or overall survival. Then the likelihood of disease- free or overall survival for the patient is assessed based on the likelihood of disease-free or overall survival for patients in that group. For example, the biological sample obtained from a patient may be determined to have elevated levels of GP88 expression relative to the standard. This patient would then be classified into a group of patients having elevated levels of GP88 expression. Since, in accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that there is a decreased length of disease- free or overall survival for the group of patients expressing elevated levels of GP88, the specific patient afflicted with cancer would be considered to have a decreased length of disease-free or overall survival.\n\n\nKits\n\n\n[0092] The present invention provides a kit to determine the levels of GP88 expression in the biological sample. Such a kit will comprise a reagent for detecting the mRNA encoding GP88, the GP88 polypeptide, or any combination or fragment thereof. The reagent will comprise one or more molecules capable of specifically binding a nucleic acid sequence (DNA or RNA) encoding GP88, or the GP88 polypeptide.\n\n\n[0093] The kit may comprise one or more nucleic acid reagents for the detection of mRNA encoding GP 88 (either sense or antisense). The one or more nucleic acid reagents may be used for hybridization and/or amplification of the mRNA encoding GP88. The kit may comprise one or more pairs of primers for amplifying the mRNA encoding GP88. \n\n The kit may further comprise samples of total mRNA derived from tissue of various physiological states, such as normal, and metastatically progressive tumor, for example, to be used as controls. The kit may also comprise buffers, nucleotide bases, and other compositions to be used in hybridization and/or amplification reactions. Each solution or composition may be contained in a vial or bottle and all vials held in close confinement in a box for commercial sale. Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a kit for use in detecting mRNA encoding GP88 in a biological sample comprising oligonucleotide probes effective to bind with elevated affinity to mRNA encoding GP88 in vitro or in situ and containers for each of these probes.\n\n\n[0094] In a further embodiment, the invention encompasses a kit for use in determining the level of GP88 expression in a biological sample comprising one or more agents, such as, for example, one or more antibodies, specific for one or more GP88 polypeptides or fragments. In one particular embodiment, the kit will comprise one or more agents and one or more nucleic acid markers wherein the agents and nucleic acid markers are modified in a fashion appropriate for carrying out immuno-polymerase chain reaction assays.\n\n\n[0095] One preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to a kit for determining the levels of GP88 expression in a mammalian biological sample, wherein said levels of GP88 expression is an indicator of the prognosis of breast cancer, said kit comprising: a) an antibody that specifically binds to GP88 or an antigen binding fragment thereof, b) a reagent useful for detecting the extent of interaction between said antibody and GP88; c) a reagent or solution useful for antigen retrieval; and c) positive and/or negative control samples. Said antibody may be directly linked to an indicator reagent, wherein said indicator reagent is selected from the group consisting of fluorescent, colorimetric, immunoperoxidase and isotopic reagents. Alternatively, the kit may further include a second indicator antibody linked to an indicator reagent, wherein said indicator reagent is selected from the group consisting of fluorescent, calorimetric, immunoperoxidase and isotopic reagents.\n\n\n[0096] In one embodiment, the kit contains at least one primary antibody (e.g., anti-GP88 monoclonal antibody 6B3), at least one labeled secondary antibody (e.g., anti-human \n\n GP88 polyclonal antibody labeled with a detection enzyme such as HRP), and at least one substrate (e.g., TMB). Alternatively, the kits can contain radiolabeled secondary antibody in place of the secondary antibody labeled with an enzyme. The kits may also contain disposable supplies for carrying out detection assays (e.g., microtiter plates, pipettes).\n\n\n[0097] It is to be understood that application of the teachings of the present invention to a specific problem or environment will be within the capability of one having ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings contained herein. The present invention is more fully illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 GP88 Expression in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\n\n\n[0098] The current methodology is based on GP88 staining in formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded human breast lesions investigated with clinical pathological variables. Cytoplasmic GP88 staining was observed in breast carcinoma whereas it was almost always negative in benign breast epithelium. 4-6 micron tissue sections from 203 formalin fixed paraffin embedded biopsies were prepared. GP88 staining was carried out by immuno-histochemistry using anti-human GP88 antibody, and the expression of GP88 was examined in normal tissues, Benign lesions, ductal and lobular carcinomas (Table 1 ; DCIS: Ductal carcinoma in situ, IDC: Infiltrating carcinoma in situ, LCIS: Lobular carcinoma in situ, ILC: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma). Further, correlation studies of GP88 expression in IDCs with histological grade, proliferation index (Ki67), p53, ER and Her-2 expression were performed.\n\n\n \n\n Table 1. Scoring of GP88 Immunostaining\n\n\n[0099] It was observed that GP88 is expressed in both ER+ and ER- tumors, and was predominantly expressed in IDCs with a correlation to histological grade and with Ki67 proliferation index.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 Analysis of Levels of GP88 expression in Breast Cancer Tissues of\n\n\nER-. ER+/LN- and ER+/LN+ Patients\n\n\nStudy Design\n\n\n[0100] The clinical study was carried out with 389 breast cancer cases (Please see Table\n\n\n2 for subject characteristics considered in the clinical study), specifically invasive ductal carcinoma tissue samples stored as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks and obtained from three tissue repositories. Inclusion criteria are as follows: Year and Age of diagnosis, Tumor Characteristics: Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), tumor grade, tumor size, nodal status, Status at last follow-up, Overall survival (OS), Recurrence status, Time until first recurrence, Treatment (ER+, LNO Tamoxifen). Cases that fit the inclusion criteria were pulled for preparing slides for the study.\n\n\nStudy Methods\n\n\n[0101] For each case, the histology laboratory from the repository processing site freshly cut 4 - 6 micron tissue sections onto positively charged microscope slides. Slides were examined for section adequacy by the pathologist in charge of pulling the blocks. GP88 expression was determined by staining slides with Oncostain 88™ kit and scored by certified pathologists.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n[0102] The current method was performed using the OncoStain 88™ IHC kit which uses a primary mouse monoclonal antibody, a secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody, a \n\n peroxidase blocker to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity and a chromogenic substrate. The primary mouse antibody binds to human GP88 expressed in the cytoplasm of breast carcinoma cells. This step was followed by the addition of a peroxidase- conjugated secondary antibody that binds to the primary antibody. The specific primary antibody-secondary antibody complex was then visualized with an optimally diluted chromogenic substrate, counterstained and cover slipped. Results were interpreted using a light microscope.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n[0103] The staining pattern of the tissue samples was analyzed and categorized (i.e. scored) as shown in Table 3. The levels of GP88 expression was observed for cytoplasmic staining in more than 10% of the tumor cells. Absence of or faint staining observed in less than 10% of the tumor cells was given a score of \"0\". A weak cytoplasmic staining observed in more than 10% of tumor cells was given a score of \"1+\", a weak to moderate cytoplasmic staining observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells was given a score of \"2+\" and a strong cytoplasmic staining observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells was given a score of \"3+\". Figure 6 shows the reactivity of anti- GP88 with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer biopsies and the staining pattern, by an indirect immunohistochemical staining method.\n\n\n[0104] The staining patterns resulted above were subjected to further interpretations aid in the assessment of prognosis of breast tumors (See Table 4, below). A score of less than 3+ (i.e. 0, 1+, and 2+) was categorized as GP88 Low Risk Group and were considered to have a decreased or lower risk of reappearance or death; and a score of 3+ was categorized as GP88 Elevated Risk Group and were considered to have a increased or higher risk of reappearance or death.\n\n\nStatistical Plan and Analysis\n\n\n[0105] The statistical analysis of results was carried out by a Biostatistician. The statistical analysis plan was based on evaluation of the test performance by its ability to predict disease-free survival and/or overall survival. It was designed to use the log-rank test for identity of pairs of diagnostic groups and the Cox proportional hazards models for quantification of risk in ER+ populations separated by lymph node status (See Table 5 \n\n below; OS = Overall Survival, DFS - Disease-free Survival, LNn = Lymph node negative and LNp = Lymph node positive). In addition survival functions for overall and disease- free survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier curves for GP88 3+ group and GP88 < 3+ (GP88 0,1, and T).\n\n\n[0106] Among ER- patients GP88 showed a statistically significant association with overall mortality (Figure 1). The data showed that patient having ER- cancers that express elevated GP88 level (GP88 3+) have a lower probability of overall survival than ER- cancers with a lower GP88 expression (GP88 0, 1+ or 2+).\n\n\n[0107] Elevated GP88 expression (3+) is a elevatedly statistically significant indicator of risk of reappearance of tumor in the ER+ / LN- population, and is significantly associated with overall mortality. A elevated level of expression of GP88 (GP88 elevated risk group with a score of 3+ in the cytoplasmic staining) was associated with decreased disease-free survival (Figure 2) and decreased overall survival (Figure 3).\n\n\n[0108] Elevated GP88 expression (3+) was also a elevatedly statistically significant indicator of recurrence risk and overall mortality in the ER+ / LN+ population. A elevated level of expression of GP88 (GP88 elevated risk group with a score of 3+ in the cytoplasmic staining) was associated with decreased disease-free survival (Figure 4) and decreased overall survival (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Age of patients = 56 (26-92) Table 2: Subject Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Scoring of Staining Pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Interpretation of Staining Pattern\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nAnalysis of Levels of GP88 Expression in biological fluids obtained from\n\n\nBreast Cancer Patients\n\n\n[0109] GP88 concentrations in human serum samples were measured in triplicate by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assay (ELISA). Standard GP88 samples were prepared from recombinant GP88 diluted in a solution of 30% glycerol and 1% milk- PB S at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, and 20 ng/ml. 100 microliter wells on a microtiter plate were coated with 10 microgram per milliliter of anti-human GP88 monoclonal antibody 6B3 (0.78 mg/ml of 6B3 antibody in phospho buffered saline (PBS)) and incubated overnight at 4\n0\nC. The wells were washed with PBS followed by the addition of anti-human PCDGF polyclonal (IgG fraction) to each well at a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml at 37\n0\nC. for 1.5 hours. The wells were washed in PBS before the addition of detection antibody (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-goat-rabbit-IgG) to each well. TMB (substrate) was added and allowed to incubate with the samples for 1 hour. The optical density of the samples was determined using an ELISA spectrometer reader set at a wavelength of 620 nanometers. Plotting the optical density of the standard GP88 samples (y-axis) against the amount of GP88 in each sample (x-axis) generated a standard curve (Figure 7). The GP88 concentration of the unknown samples was determined by measuring the optical density and using the standard curve (Figure 6) to determine the GP88 concentration.\n\n\n[0110] Circulating level of GP88 was measured for patients afflicted with breast cancer patients that have no evidence of disease and that have progressive disease. It was observed (Figure 8) that the level of GP88 in serum of Breast Cancer Patients (BC Pts) with no evidence of disease (baseline) is within the range of healthy individuals. \n\n However, BC Pts with progressive disease have significantly higher circulating levels of GP88.\n\n\n[0111] Studies further showed that circulating levels of GP88 expression in breast cancer patients that have no evidence of disease remain low and within the range of healthy individuals. GP88 expression levels were measured (Figure 9) in patients with no evidence of disease, for an extended period of time (i.e. 4 years: Oct. 04 to Apr. 08, as shown in Figure 9). The results showed that patients with early stage disease (Stage 2) that have no evidence of disease maintained stable levels of GP88 that are within the range of healthy individuals.\n\n\n[0112] Circulating levels of GP88 was observed for patients that expressed elevated levels of GP88 in the early stage (stage 2) who relapsed to stage 4 disease over time (Approximately, one and half year: Jan 06 to May 07, in the instant case). The data showed (Figure 10) that the patients expressed abnormally elevated levels of GP88 in the late stages.\n\n\nElevated levels of GP88 is associated with loss of survival\n\n\n[0113] The level of GP88 in the serum of two patients who died of breast cancer was measured using the standard ELISA protocol, and it was observed maintenance of elevated levels of GP88 for several weeks lead to a decrease in survival. The two patients ended the study when they were determined as having no evidence of disease (NED), wherein the GP88 level was low and within the range of healthy individuals (about 20 units - 20 ng/ml). However, over time, levels of GP88 reached to 160 to 200 units (160-200 ng/ml) at which point, patient 1 died within a week (Figure HA) and patient 2 died with 3 weeks (Figure HB).\n\n\n[0114] Similar results were observed when the level of GP88 expression was measured in plasma of breast cancer patients, i.e. elevated levels of GP88 was observed when compared to the healthy individuals.\n\n\n[0115] Although the invention has been described with reference to the disclosed embodiments, it should be understood that various modifications can be made without \n\n departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is limited only by the following claims.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nStudies to Validate GP88 as a Prognostic Factor in Lung Cancer\n\n\n[0116] As described in the materials and methods of Example 2 above, examination of GP88 expression in tissue microarrays using Oncostain 88™ IHC kit demonstrated GP88 expression in lung cancer tissue from both Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma and absence of GP88 expression in normal human tissues including normal human lung tissue (Table 5 below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: GP88 Staining Analysis in Normal and Carcinoma Lung Tissues\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nAnalysis of Levels of GP88 expression in Lung Cancer Tissues\n\n\n[0117] To determine if increasing levels of GP 88 in Stage I/II lung cancer tissue correlate with reduced disease-free-survival (DFS) in lung cancer patients, GP88 expression was calculated in 85 cases of resectable stage I/II NSCLC, provided with clinical and outcome data. The tissue was stained using Oncostain 88™ IHC kit and the resulting stained slides were scored for GP88 staining by a Board Certified Pathologist.\n\n\n[0118] Upon analyzing GP88 scores and survival data using Kaplan-Meier plots, a statistically significant decrease in DFS as GP88 levels increased was observed. This \n\n was tested formally by fitting a Cox proportional hazard model using SAS PROC PHREG, treating the GP88 level as an interval- scaled predictor of recurrence. This gave a highly significant association between GP88 and recurrence (P=0.0091). The coefficient of GP88 was 0.676, indicating that each one-unit increase in GP88 corresponded to an approximate doubling of the recurrence hazard (Figure 14).\n\n\n[0119] Correlation of GP88 expression with overall survival in the same 85 cases demonstrated a 74% increase in risk of dying for every increase in GP88 score (Figure 15). These data demonstrate that, similar to breast cancer, GP88 expression can be used as a risk predictor of recurrence in, lung cancer, for example, in early stage NSCLC.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nAnalysis of Levels of GP88 Expression in Biological Fluids Obtained From Lung Cancer\n\n\nPatients\n\n\n[0120] GP88 concentrations in human serum samples obtained from lung cancer patients and healthy non-lung cancer patients were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assay (ELISA). Data shown in Table 6 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*2 patients progressed following initial measurement reaching 120ng/ml\n\n\nTable 7. Comparison of GP88 serum levels in lung cancer and healthy non-lung cancer patients.\n\n\n[0121] The data shown in Table 7 indicate that serum GP88 can be used as a predictive indicator in lung cancer. Further, data analysis, using a comparative box and whisker plot, showed a clear difference between the samples obtained from lung cancer and \n\n healthy non-lung cancer patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum test confirms this visual impression, yielding an approximate P value of 0.0004. ] While the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art from a reading of this disclosure that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of the invention and appended claims.

Description\n\n\n\n\n METHODS FOR USING TGF-β RECEPTOR INHIBITORS OR ACTIVIN-LIKE KINASE (ALK) 5 INHIBITORS A-83-01 AND SB-431542 TO TREAT EYE DISEASE\n\n\nAND WOUND HEALING CONDITIONS\n\n\n[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent No. 61/057,461, filed on May 30, 2008.\n\n\n[0002] The development of this invention was supported by funding from the American Health Assistance Foundation, G2006-014 and the National Eye Institute, EYO 1792. The government has an interest in the invention.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n[0003] Ocular fibrotic wound response is a major cause of impaired vision and blindness, especially as a consequence of the surgical treatment for glaucoma. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States, and 2.5 million Americans and 65 million people worldwide were affected by the disease in 2000. Glaucoma is a disease characterized by damage to the optic nerve head, and neural and visual loss. One of the major risk factors of glaucoma is an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting from abnormalities in the aqueous humor outflow pathway. Glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) is commonly performed when medication fails to control IOP adequately.\n\n\n[0004] Excessive post-operation scarring often leads to failure of GFS. While the use of antimetabolites such as mitomycin-C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil as conjunctival anti-scarring treatments benefits a number of patients, they do so by causing widespread cell death and are associated with severe and potentially blinding complications, such as hypotony maculopathy and infection. Therefore, other anti- scarring approaches have been investigated. In particular, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and its pathway have emerged as a target for postoperative anti-scarring therapy.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0005] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate various example systems, methods, and so on, that illustrate various example embodiments of aspects of the invention.

Preferably, the \n\n method may be used to treat human patients during or following glaucoma filtration surgery. In glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS), a new drainage site is created to facilitate drainage of fluid from the eye, thereby decreasing the intraocular pressure in the eye. As shown in Fig. 1, the human eye includes the conjunctiva 12, trabecular meshwork 14, iris 16, cornea 18, retina 24, and lens 26, among other components.\n\n\n[0014] During GFS, instead of draining into the normal drainage site (the trabecular meshwork) 14 of the eye, the aqueous humor is drained into a new \"space\" that is created under the conjunctiva 12 of the eye. To do this, a small flap in the white of the eye is made. This is followed by the creation of a new drainage route 28 between the opening of the route 20 and a reservoir called a filtration bleb 22. The fluid in the anterior and posterior chamber, called the aqueous humor, can then drain into the bleb 22 via the new drainage route 28 and be absorbed into the vessels around the eye. The bleb 22 and/or the new drainage route 28 can scar and close preventing the aqueous humor from properly draining, called bleb failure.\n\n\n[0015] Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a key mediator of wound healing responses. In the eye, TGF-β has been implicated in causing corneal haze after laser surgery and subconjunctival scarring following glaucoma filtration surgery. In addition, TGF-β upregulation is involved in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), which is a major cause for the failure of retinal detachment surgery.\n\n\n[0016] The activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 5 inhibitors may block the TGF- β signaling pathway, and thus, may be used to prevent corneal haze and scarring following ocular surgery, including GFS, vitreo-retinal surgeries, treatments of corneal trauma, and LASIK. Also, the use of the ALK-5 inhibitors may reduce the side effects associated with current anti-scarring medications, such as bleeding, infection, swelling, scarring, retinal detachment, a droopy eyelid, double vision, loss of vision, or even loss of the eye. Finally, topical application of ALK-5 inhibitors to the human eye may lower the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. \n\n [0017] In one embodiment, one or more of the following compounds may be used. Manufacturer designation has been provided where available. The compounds are available from Sigma, P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A-83-01) (SB431542)\n\n\n[0018] The above-described compositions may include ALK-5 inhibitors, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, that can be included in various types of pharmaceutical vehicles suitable for intraocular use, such as polymer carriers and carriers that are capable of forming gels upon administration. The vehicles are preferably aqueous, and are formulated to be chemically and physically compatible with ophthalmic tissues. For example, bioerodible (or biodegradable) gels or collagen inserts may be used to keep an effective concentration of the inhibitor in the bleb. The use of such gels or inserts has the advantage of providing a sustained release of the active components at the surgical site.\n\n\n[0019] The compositions may include an effective amount of the ALK-5 inhibitor. Preferably, the compositions may include from about 0.3 to about 15 μM of the ALK-5 inhibitor, and more preferably from about 3 to about 10 μM of inhibitor. It should be appreciated by one of skill in the art that compositions including more than 15 μM may also be used.\n\n\n[0020] As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the above-described compositions should be sterile and should not include any agents which will be toxic to sensitive intraocular tissues, particularly cornea/endothelial cells. The above described compositions can be formulated in accordance with techniques known to those skilled in the art. \n\n [0021] The above described compositions can be applied to the surgical site by means of various techniques. For example, the compositions can be applied by means of a syringe during or immediately after surgery, preferably within 4 hours, or with a sustained release polymer that can be inserted into the eye on or around the surgical site. The compositions may be applied to the surgical site in a topical formulation following LASIK to prevent or reduce corneal haze.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nIn Vitro Cell Preparation with Inhibitors and TGF-β2\n\n\n[0022] Sample fibroblasts were obtained from New Zealand white rabbit eyes. The fibroblasts were derived from the subconjunctival tissues isolated from the eyes of the subjects. The third to fifth passages of cells were maintained in 25 cm\n2\n flasks using 3 ml of medium composed of Eagle's minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, essential and nonessential aminoacids, and antibiotics. When the cells reached confluence, they were trypsinized and passaged.\n\n\n[0023] The fibroblast cultures in 6-well plates were pre-treated with 2 ml of medium including ALK-5 inhibitors at various concentrations, 0.03, 0.1, 0.03, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 μM, for one hour, and were additionally treated with\n\n\n2 ng/ml of TGF-β2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for up to 72 hours. As shown in Table 1, samples 1-7 were prepared with ALK-5 inhibitor A-83-01 and samples 8-14 with ALK-5 inhibitor SB431542.\n\n\n[0024] Samples 15 and 16 were prepared as controls. Sample 15 was not treated with an ALK-5 inhibitor or TGF-β2. Sample 16 was treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β2, but not with an ALK-5 inhibitor. The samples were prepared as shown in Table 1, below. \n\n Table 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern blotting for CTGF\n\n\n[0025] Cells from the various samples were harvested following the treatment with the inhibitors and/or TGF-β2, and Western blotting was performed to provide quantitative assessments. The conjunctival fibroblasts were lysed in a Triton lysis buffer. The total protein in the lysates was quantified using a Bradford protein assay. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg/lane) were resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)- polyacrylamide gel. The protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.\n\n\n[0026] After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were probed with polyclonal goat anti-CTGF (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,) followed by HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The TGF-β signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using SuperSignal from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Densitometry was then performed to measure the intensity of bands.\n\n\n[0027] The densitometry showed reduced CTGF protein band intensities, i.e. 37-38 and 42-44 kDa, for the samples at concentrations above lμM, indicating diminished protein levels in the samples treated with the ALK-5 inhibitors. The \n\n membranes were also probed for the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as an internal standard. As shown in Figs. 2-3, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated to evaluate effectiveness of each inhibitor in inhibiting TGF-β2 function. As the concentration of the inhibitors increased, the percentage TGF-β2 inhibited also increased. It is noted that the percentage of inhibition of the growth factor was dependent on the specific concentration of the respective inhibitors administered. Generally, the growth factor was inhibited to some extent by applying at least 1 μM of inhibitor to the cells. In some cases as much as 3μM was required to provide inhibition of the signaling pathway. The control samples prepared without the inhibitors showed no inhibitory function of the TGF-β signaling pathway. It should be noted that in Figs. 2-3, the \"-1\" demarcation on the graphs represents the expression percentage of the TGF-β downstream protein without ALK-5 inhibitors and TGF-β found when sample 15 was tested, and \"0\" demarcation represents the test data from a sample 16 tested without the respective ALK-5 inhibitor added, but with the TGF- β solution added.\n\n\n[0028] Some samples prepared with low concentrations of the inhibitors actually showed an increase in the activity of the signaling pathway, leading to the conclusion that effective treatment with the inhibitors will be dependent on the specific inhibitor used and the concentration of the inhibitor applied to the surgical site. Moreover, it is desirable to maintain a constant concentration of the inhibitor on the surgical site over a prolonged period of time. Therefore, it may be desirable to apply the inhibitors with methods providing sustained release of the composition, such as with topical gels, polymer implants, and the like.\n\n\nWestern Blotting for α-SMA, and fibronectin\n\n\n[0029] To test for fibronectin and α-SMA protein expression after the treatment with the respective inhibitors, rabbit subconjunctival fibroblasts, as prepared in samples 1-16, were incubated for 48 to 72 hours. As shown in Fig. 5, A-83-01 and SB-431542 effectively inhibited the protein expression induced by TGF-B2. Band intensity for both proteins was reduced in A-83-01 and SB-431542 treated samples compared with the \n\n bands of those samples not treated with the inhibitors. The reduction in protein levels is more pronounced with a higher concentration of the inhibitors. The blots were also probed for β-actin to control for equal protein loading.\n\n\n[0030] The expression of α-SMA and fibronectin in fibroblasts that were treated with the A-83-01 and SB-431642, as detailed in Table 1, was measured to determine the extent to which the inhibitors blocked the TGF-β2 signaling pathway. Proteins in the cell lysates (20 μg/lane) were resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)- polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were probed with monoclonal mouse anti-α- SMA (1 :9,000) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 :150,000; Jackson), or monoclonal mouse anti-fibronectin (1 : 1,000) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti- mouse IgG (1:10,000). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescense.\n\n\nImmunocytofluorescense Microscopy Imaging Techniques\n\n\n[0031] In another example, subconjunctival fibroblasts were cultured on 8-well chamber slides. The samples were prepared as in samples 5-6 and 13-16 and incubated for 72 hours. After inhibitor treatment, the fibroblast cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or with ice-cold methanol for Alexa Fluor or FITC staining, respectively. After permeabilization, the cells cultures were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-CTGF (1:50, Santa Cruz) followed by Alexa Fluor donkey anti-goat IgG (10 μg/mL, Invitrogen), monoclonal mouse anti-fibronectin (10 μg/mL, Invitrogen) or monoclonal mouse anti-α-SMA (1:400, Sigma) followed by FITC goat anti-mouse IgG (1 :100, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cell cultures were mounted with aqueous mounting media with DAPI and viewed by fluoresence microscopy.\n\n\n[0032] As shown in Fig. 6, CTGF, fibronectin, and α-SMA were visualized with FITC or Alexa Fluor labeling (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). A dramatic increase in staining for CTGF, α-SMA, and fibronectin was observed following TGF-β2 incubation. The staining intensity of TGF-β2-induced proteins was greatly reduced when the cells were treated concomitantly with the A-83-01 or SB431542 \n\n inhibitors. No obvious cell death was observed in the samples treated with either inhibitor. Bar, 50 μM.\n\n\nFibroblast Morphology\n\n\n[0033] In another example, rabbit fibroblasts were prepared as in samples 6, 14, 15, and 16 except that 5 ng/ml of TGF-β2 was added to the samples instead of 2 ng/ml. The morphology of the cell cultures was visualized by phase contrast microscopy, as shown in Fig. 7. Myofibroblast-like appearance was observed in cells treated with TGF- β2. The TGF-β2 -induced morphologic change seemed to be averted by addition of A-83- 01 or SB431542. No obvious cell death was observed for the samples treated with the inhibitors.\n\n\n[0034] The ALK inhibitors A-83-01 and SB-431542 effectively block TGF-β2 activity related to wound healing in cultured rabbit subconjunctival fibroblasts. No obvious cell toxicity was observed in the cell cultures prepared with either inhibitor. Thus, these inhibitors may be used as ocular anti-scarring agents, especially for glaucoma filtration surgery.\n\n\n[0035] While example methods and compositions have been illustrated by describing examples, and while the examples have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicants to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the systems, methods, devices, and so on, described herein.

The invention as hereinbefore described.\n\n\nRECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91) ISA/EP Description\n\n\n\n\n Isoxazolo[4,5lpyridin-3-yl-piperazin derivatives useful as modulators of dopamine D3 receptors\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds of the general formula I,\n\n\n \n\n wherein:\n\n\nR is Ci-\n6\n-alkyl;\n\n\nCi-\n6\n-alkyl substituted by one 3 to 6 membered monocyclic cycloalkyl or 1 to 3 halogens; Ci-\n6\n-alkoxy; aryl; aryl substituted by 1 to 3 halogens; heteroaryl; or heteroaryl substituted by 1 to 3 halogens; as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of formula I have affinity for dopamine D3 receptors and thus are useful in the treatment of conditions wherein modulation, especially antagonism/inhibition, of D3 receptors is beneficial, e. g. to treat drug dependency or as antipsychotic agents.\n\n\nBackground Information Dopamine, a major catecholamine neurotransmitter, is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions which include emotion, cognition, motor functions, and positive reinforcement, (Purves, D. et al. (2004) Neuroscience. Sinauer, third edition, Sunderland, Massachusetts). The biological activities of dopamine are mediated through G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) and in human, five different dopamine receptors D\nr\nD\n5\n have been identified, where the D\n2\n-like receptors (D\n2\n, D\n3\n and D\n4\n) couple to the G-protein G\nα\ni (Missale, C. et al.. ( 1998) Dopamine receptors: from structure to function. Physiol. Rev. 78, 189-225). The D\n3\n dopamine receptor is most highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens (Gurevich, E. V., Joyce, J. N. ( 1999) Distribution of dopamine D3 receptor expressing neurons in the human forebrain: comparison with D2 receptor expressing neurons. Neuropsychopharmacology 20, 60-80), and is proposed to modulate the mesolimbic pathway consisting of neuronal projections from the ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and amygdala to the nucleus accumbens, which projects to the prefrontal and cingulate cortices as well as various thalamic nuclei.\n\n\nSMU 16.04.2009 \n\n The limbic circuit is thought to be important for emotional behavior and thus D\n3\n receptor antagonists are proposed to modulate psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder (Joyce, J. N. and Millan, M. J., (2005) Dopamine D3 receptor antagonists as therapeutic agents. Drug Discovery Today, 1 JuI, Vol. 10, No. 13, 917-25), while these antagonists spare the D\n2\n modulated striatal extrapyramidal system (associated with EPS induction). In addition, it has been reported that drug naive schizophrenic patients show altered levels of D\n3\n receptor expression (Gurevich, E. V. et al. (1997) Mesolimbic dopamine D3 receptors and use of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia. A postmortem study. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 54, 225-232) and dopamine release (Laruelle, M. (2000) Imaging dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia: implication for treatment. Presented at Workshop Schizophr.: Pathol. Bases and Mech. Antipsychotic Action, Chicago), indicating that a disturbed homeostasis of dopamine plays an important role in the etiology of schizophrenic symptoms.\n\n\nDetailed description of the invention\n\n\nCompounds of formula I and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been found to be useful in the treatment of all aspects of drug dependency, including drug intake, relapse to drug-seeking behaviour following abstinence and withdrawal symptoms from drugs of abuse such as alcohol, cocaine, opiates, nicotine, benzodiazepines and inhibition of tolerance induced by opioids, as well as for the treatment of drug craving. It is also useful as an antipsychotic agent for example in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, schizophreniform diseases, psychotic depression (which term includes bipolar depression, unipolar depression, single or recurrent major depressive episodes with or without psychotic features, catatonic features, melancholic features, atypical features or postpartum onset, seasonal affective disorder and dysthymia, depressive disorders resulting from a general medical condition including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, diabetes, miscarriage or abortion), anxiety disorders (which includes generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorder), mania, acute mania, paranoid and delusional disorders. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of a family of related disorders referred to as somatoform disorders, as well as for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The compounds are further useful for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction (smoking cessation, cocaine and others) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\n\nCompounds of formula I may form acid addition salts with acids, such as conventional pharmaceutically acceptable acids, for example hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate, salicylate, sulphate, pyruvate, citrate, lactate, mandelate, tartarate, and methanesulphonate. Preferred are the hydrochloride salts. Also solvates and hydrates of compounds of formula I and their salts form part of the present invention. \n\n Compounds of formula I can have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and can exist in the form of optically pure enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers such as, for example, racemates, optically pure diastereoisomers, mixtures of diastereoisomers, diastereoisomeric racemates or mixtures of diastereoisomeric racemates. The optically active forms can be obtained for example by resolution of the racemates, by asymmetric synthesis or asymmetric chromatography (chromatography with a chiral adsorbens or eluant). The invention embraces all of these forms.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated, that the compounds of general formula I in this invention may be derivatized at functional groups to provide derivatives which are capable of conversion back to the parent compound in vivo.

The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, washed three times with cold PBS and stored at -80\n0\nC prior to use. The pellet was suspended in cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Basel, Switzerland) for 20-30 sec at 12.000 rpm. After centrifugation at 48.000 X g for 30 min at 4°C, the pellet was resuspended in cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), homogenized, and centrifuged as above. This pellet was further resuspended in a smaller volume of ice cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron for 20-30 sec at 12.000 rpm. The protein content of this homogenate was determined with the Bio-Rad (Bradford) Protein Assay (Biorad Laboratories GmbH, Mϋnchen, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer using gamma globulin as the standard. This homogenate was stored at -80\n0\nC in aliquots and thawed immediately prior to use. \n\n Radioligand binding assay conditions\n\n\nAliquots of membrane preparations were thawed at RT, resuspended in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH=7.4), homogenized with a Polytron for 20-30 sec at 12.000 rpm and adjusted to a final concentration of approximately 7.5 μg protein / well.\n\n\nThe binding affinity (Ki) of the compounds was determined using radioligand binding. Membranes were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl with a fixed concentration of radioligand (final concentration approximately 0.5 nM [\n3\nH] -spiperone) and ten concentrations of test compound in ranging between 10 μM -0.1 nM for 1 h at RT. At the end of the incubation, the reaction mixtures were filtered on to unifilter 96-well white microplates with bonded GF/C filters (Packard BioScience, Zurich, Switzerland; preincubated for 1 h in 0.1% polyethylenimine (PEI) in assay buffer) with a Filtermate 196 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold assay buffer. The nonspecific binding was determined with equally composed reaction mixtures in the presence of 10 μM unlabelled spiperone. Per well 45 μl of Microscint 40 (Perkin Elmer, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) was added, plates for sealed, shaken for 20 min and counted for 3 min on a Topcount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Canberra Packard SA, Zurich, Switzerland) with quenching correction.\n\n\nData calculation\n\n\nThe CPM value for each duplicate of a concentration of competing compound was averaged (yl), then the % specific binding was calculated according to the equation (((yl - non-specific)/(total binding-non-specific) )xl 00). Graphs were plotted with the % specific binding using XLfit, a curve fitting program that iteratively plots the data using Levenburg Marquardt algorithm. The single site competition analysis equation used was y = A + ((B- A)/( l+((x/C)\nD\n))), where y is the % specific binding, A is the minimum y, B is the maximum y, C is the IC50, x is the logio of the concentration of the competing compound and D is the slope of the curve (the Hill Coefficient). From these curves the IC50 (inhibition concentration at which 50% specific binding of the radioligand was displaced) and Hill coefficient were determined. The affinity constant (Ki) was calculated using the Cheng- Prusoff equation Ki = (ICso/l+( [L]/Kd), where [L] is the concentration of radioligand and Kd is the dissociation constant of the radioligand at the receptor as determined by the saturation isotherm.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are potent modulators of the dopamine D\n3\n receptors as this is shown with the activity table hereinafter which gives the Ki values in μM for the dopamine D\n3\n receptors for some examples of the compounds of the present invention: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: acticity table: human Ki values of selected examples \n\n The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such as carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nThe dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/ day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day. \n\n Synthesis\n\n\nrt\n\n\nrt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNa(AcO)\n3\nBH, Et\n3\nN\n\n\nN H Boc CH2CL, rt\n\n\n(H)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(F) R' = Boc HCI (G) R' = NH.

[0003] Not applicable\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0004] Cancer is a disease marked by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Cancer cells have overcome the barriers imposed on normal cells, which have a finite lifespan, to grow indefinitely. As cancerous cell growth continues, genetic alterations may mount until a cancerous cell has achieved a more aggressive growth phenotype. If left untreated, metastasis, which is the spread of cancer cells to distant areas of the body by way of the lymph system or bloodstream, may ensue. Metastasis can result in the destruction of healthy organs and tissues when cancerous cells infiltrate different areas of the body and continue growing to form new tumors.\n\n\n[0005] According to a recent American Cancer Society study, approximately 1,500,000 new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in the year 2008 alone. Despite the availability of numerous chemotherapeutic agents and diagnostic tools, additional diagnostic methods are needed to investigate the mechanisms and pathways that lead to \n\n cancerous cell growth. Such methods may lead to early intervention that can be used effectively against various types of cancers. Specific cancers respond to certain treatments better, identification of such cancers may lead to a better cure rate. This invention caters to such needs among others.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0006] The present disclosure demonstrates that depletion of FBXW7 increases the levels of mTOR and p-mTOR. The enzyme mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) has become a major target for therapeutic intervention to treat a number of complex human diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular dysfunction. While much has been learned about the signaling mechanisms that operate upstream (Pten-PI3 K-AKT) or downstream (S6-K, 4E- BP) from mTOR, almost nothing is known about the processes that control levels of mTOR protein.\n\n\n[0007] The present invention demonstrates that mTOR is targeted for ubiquitination and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7 (also known as hCDC4, FBWl and MGO). FBXW7 binds directly to mTOR, leading to increased ubiquitination and protein turnover, both in mouse and in human cells. Since deletion or mutation of human PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) also leads to activation of mTOR, the genetic relationship between FBXW7 and PTEN in human cancers was also investigated.\n\n\n[0008] Cell lines from human breast cancers, as well as primary breast tumors, showed a reciprocal relationship between deletion or mutation of PTEN and loss of FBXW7. Tumors that showed heterozygous loss of FBXW7 generally showed no loss or mutation of PTEN, and vice versa. Tumor cell lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXWl are particularly sensitive to Rapamycin treatment, suggesting that loss of FBXWl may be a novel biomarker for human cancers susceptible to treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.\n\n\n[0009] In one aspect this invention provides a method of determining if a subject at risk for or diagnosed with cancer should receive mTOR inhibitor therapy, the method involving a step of determining if one or more copies of the Fbxw7 gene is mutated (includes deletion) in a patient sample.\n\n\n[0010] In another aspect this invention provides a method of determining the risk of cancer. The method involves the step of determining the amounts of mTOR, p-mTOR and/or one or \n\n more downstream components relative to one or more upstream components, wherein the downstream and upstream components are components of the mTOR signaling pathway.\n\n\n[0011] In yet another aspect this invention provides a method of determining if a subject at risk for or diagnosed with cancer should receive mTOR inhibitor therapy, the method involves a step of determining the amounts of mTOR, p-mTOR and/or one or more downstream components relative to one or more upstream components in a patient sample, wherein said downstream and upstream components are components of the mTOR signaling pathway.\n\n\n[0012] In another embodiment a method of assaying for compounds that treat cancer in a subject is disclosed. The method comprising the steps of contacting a cell with one or more candidate compounds, and monitor the effect of said one or more candidate compounds on Fbxw7 gene or protein expression; thereby indentifying said one or more candidate compounds that alters mTOR expression or activity.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0013] Figure 1 illustrates identification of Fbxw7 novel targets by genome-wide search using CPD sequences. Comparison of minimal consensus CPD sequences found in mTOR with those of the known human target proteins cyclin E (CCNE) and C-Myc.\n\n\n[0014] Figure 2 illustrates that CPD sequences of mTor are evolutionarily conserved in different species ranging from humans to zebra fish.\n\n\n[0015] Figure 3 shows that depletion of FBXW7 increases mTOR and p-mTOR levels.\n\n\n[0016] Figure 3 A shows that the levels of mTor and p-mTor, as well as the downstream mTor target S6-kinase (P-S6), are upregulated in Fbxw7-/- MEFs, whereas the levels of Akt and p-Akt (lower panels) were not appreciably affected. Two independent preparations of MEFs were used, with similar results in both cases.\n\n\n[0017] Figure 3B illustrates elevation of mTor in tissues from Fbxw7 knockout mice. For both thymus (left panel) and spleen (right panel) Lane 1 contains extracts from wild-type mice, lane 2 from Pten+I- mice, and lane 3 from Fbxw7+/- mice. Comparing lane 1 with lane 3, mTor and p-mTor protein levels are increased in the Fbxw7+I- tissues. In contrast, levels of Akt and p-Akt are not significantly altered in the same Fbxw7+/- lysates. While loss of \n\n one copy of Pten does not significantly change mTor protein levels, both Akt and p-Akt are elevated.\n\n\n[0018] Figure 3C shows that the levels of mTOR and p-mTOR, as well as the downstream mTOR target S6-kinase (P-S6), are upregulated by depletion FBXW7 in human colon cancer cell lines HCTl 16 and DLDl, whereas the levels of AKT and p-AKT (lower panels) were not appreciably affected.\n\n\n[0019] Figure 3D illustrates downregulation of mTOR by expression of a dominant negative truncated FBXW7 protein. Overexpression of full length FBXW7 (HA-FBXW7) in 293T cells decreases the mTOR and p-mTOR levels (lane 2) in comparison to cells containing only the empty vector (lane 1), in contrast, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of FBXW7 (HA-FBXW7-ΔF) increases the mTOR and p-mTOR levels (Iane3).\n\n\n[0020] Figure 4 shows that mTOR interacts directly with FBXW7.\n\n\n[0021] Figure 4 A illustates immunoprecipitation of HA tagged FBXW7 identifies mTOR as an interacting protein. Human 293 cells were transfected with the full length or truncated (FBXW7 or FBXW7-ΔF) constructs, followed by immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged proteins and immunoblotting with antibodies against mTOR (top panel). In the reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation of mTOR shows that the region of FBXW7 that interacts is the WD40 domain which is retained in the FBXW7ΔF construct (middle panel). Lower panel shows the input levels of mTOR and FBXW7 proteins in the lysates.\n\n\n[0022] Figure 4B shows that the wild type fragment of human mTOR was cloned into p3XFL AG-CMV- 10 vector. The DelT631 and T631G fragments were generated by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis.\n\n\n[0023] Figure 4C shows that FBXW7 binds the wild-type fragment of mTOR, but binding to the mTOR(delT631) and mTOR(T631G) mutants was dramatically reduced by about 80%.\n\n\n[0024] Figure 4D shows that MCF7 breast cancer cells show increased mTOR levels upon treatment with MG-132, but this is not seen in SUM149PT cells which have no functional FBXW7 gene.\n\n\n[0025] Figure 4E illustrates that the regulation of mTOR by FBXW7 is through the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. 293 T and SUM 149PT cells were transfected with a vector containing CMV promoter-driven HA-ubiquitin. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR followed by Western blot analysis of the HA-ubiquitin showed that in 293T cells \n\n which have functional FBXW7 protein, the immunoprecipitated mTOR is ubiquitinated, whereas SUM 149PT cells, which lack FBXW7, show no mTOR ubiquitination. The two right hand lanes show overall ubiquitin levels in the same cell lysates.\n\n\n[0026] Figure 4F, HCTl 16_WT and HCTl 16_FBXW7-/- cells were transfected with HA- ubiquitin. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR followed by Western blot analysis of the HA- ubiquitin showed that ubiquitination of mTOR was only seen in the HCTl 16_WT cells, and not in HCTl 16_FBXW7-/- cells. The vector lane shows HCTl 16_FBXW7-/- cells transfected with empty vector construct.\n\n\n[0027] Figure 4G illustrates that ubiquitination of mTOR is restored by exogenous FBXW7 expression. HCTl 16_FBXW7-/- cells were transfected with an FBXW7-expressing construct and HA-tagged ubiquitin. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR showed increased ubiquitination compared to controls. The increased ubiquitination had only a small effect on mTOR levels in these experiments (Figure 8), probably because of the pleiotropic effects of over-expressing this potent tumor suppressor in tumor cells, which leads to growth arrest and apoptosis.\n\n\n[0028] Figure 5 illustrates genetic interaction between FBXW7 and PTEN in human breast cancers. The panels show concordance of gene copy number changes in breast cancer cell lines (Figure 5A) and in 3 independent sets of primary breast tumors (Figures 5B-D). The lighter-gray bar indicates loss, the darker-gray bar indicates gain, and the black bar indicates no changes in gene copy number.\n\n\n[0029] Figure 5A illustrates the data from 53 human breast cancer cell lines, ordered in the vertical axis from 1-53 (Neve R.M. et al., Cancer Cell 10:515-27 (2006)). The copy number of FBXW7 and PTEN was determined by quantitative PCR TaqMan using FBXW7 and PTEN specific probes. Lighter-gray bars indicating deletion of FBXW7 rarely occur in tumors that also show deletion of PTEN (pvalue=0.014).\n\n\n[0030] Figures 5B-D illustrate three independent sets of human primary breast cancers, the DNAs of which have been analyzed by the same BAC CGH microarray platform.\n\n\n(B) 185 human primary breast cancers analyzed by Climent et al.

Polymorphism may also be considered as a mutation for the purposes of this application. The determination involves detecting Fbxw7 DNA, RNA, or protein and determining whether or not the molecule is mutated, thereby determining whether or not the gene is mutated. Any method known to those of skill in the art to detect mutations can be used, including PCR (e.g., Taqman), sequencing techniques, Southern, western, and northern blots, microarrays, immunohistochemical techniques, ELISA, mass spectroscopy, enzymatic, binding or functional assays, and the like.\n\n\n[0041] This invention also presents a method of determination of risk of cancer by comparing the relative amounts of components of the mTOR signaling pathway that are downstream to mTOR versus the amounts of components of the mTOR signaling pathway that are upstream to mTOR. Relatively higher levels of mTOR and downstream components as compared to a control are indicative of absence of the Fbxw7 protein or presence of the Fbxw7 mutated gene.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n[0042] \"Mammalian target of rapamycin protein inhibitor\" or \"mTOR inhibitor\" includes drugs such as rapamycin, deforolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus that selectively inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).\n\n\n[0043] As used herein, the term \"cancer\" refers to a disease involving cells that have the potential to metastasize to distal sites and exhibit phenotypic traits that differ from those of non-cancer cells. Cancer cells acquire a characteristic set of functional capabilities during their development, albeit through various mechanisms. Such capabilities include evading apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, tissue invasion/metastasis, limitless replicative potential, and sustained angiogenesis. The term \"cancer cell\" is meant to encompass both pre-malignant and malignant cancer cells. Other forms of cancer include carcinomas, sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, leukemias, \n\n etc., including solid and lymphoid cancers, head and neck cancer, e.g. , oral cavity, pharyngeal and tongue cancer, kidney, breast, lung, kidney, bladder, colon, endometrium, T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), ovarian, prostate, pancreas, stomach, brain, skin, melanoma, basal cell, uterine, testicular, esophagus, and liver cancer, including hepatocarcinoma, lymphoma, including non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (e.g., Burkitt's, Small Cell, and Large Cell lymphomas) and Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma.\n\n\n[0044] The term \"marker\" refers to a molecule (typically protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, or lipid) that is expressed in the cell, expressed on the surface of a cancer cell, secreted by a cancer cell or over or under expressed as compared to a non-cancer cell, and which is useful for the diagnosis of cancer, for providing a prognosis, and for preferential targeting of a pharmacological agent to the cancer cell. Oftentimes, such markers are molecules that are differentially expressed, e.g., overexpressed or underexpressed in a melanoma or other cancer cell in comparison to a normal cell, for instance, 1 -fold over/under expression, 2-fold over/under expression, 3 -fold over/under expression or more in comparison to a noncancerous cell, or a primary cancer (vs. mets). Further, a marker can be a molecule that is inappropriately synthesized in the cancer cell, for instance, a molecule that contains deletions, additions or mutations in comparison to the molecule expressed on a non-cancerous cell.\n\n\n[0045] It will be understood by the skilled artisan that markers may be used singly or in combination with other markers for any of the uses, e.g., determination of the suitability of a subject for mTOR inhibitor therapy, disclosed herein.\n\n\n[0046] \"Biological sample\" includes sections of tissues such as biopsy and autopsy samples, and frozen sections taken for histologic purposes. Such samples include blood and blood fractions or products (e.g., serum, plasma, platelets, red blood cells, and the like), sputum, hair, nails, skin tissue, lymph and tongue tissue, cultured cells, e.g., primary cultures, explants, and transformed cells, stool, urine, etc. A biological sample is typically obtained from a eukaryotic organism, most preferably a mammal such as a primate e.g., chimpanzee or human; cow; dog; cat; a rodent, e.g., guinea pig, rat, Mouse; rabbit; or a bird; reptile; or fish.\n\n\n[0047] A \"biopsy\" refers to the process of removing a tissue sample for diagnostic or prognostic evaluation, and to the tissue specimen itself. Any biopsy technique known in the art can be applied to the diagnostic and prognostic methods of the present invention. The biopsy technique applied will depend on the tissue type to be evaluated (e.g., skin, colon, \n\n prostate, kidney, bladder, lymph node, liver, bone marrow, blood cell, etc.), the size and type of the tumor (e.g., solid or suspended, blood or ascites), among other factors. Representative biopsy techniques include, but are not limited to, excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy, needle biopsy, surgical biopsy, and bone marrow biopsy. An \"excisional biopsy\" refers to the removal of an entire tumor mass with a small margin of normal tissue surrounding it. An \"incisional biopsy\" refers to the removal of a wedge of tissue that includes a cross-sectional diameter of the tumor. A diagnosis or prognosis made by endoscopy or fluoroscopy can require a \"core-needle biopsy\" of the tumor mass, or a \"fine-needle aspiration biopsy\" which generally obtains a suspension of cells from within the tumor mass. Biopsy techniques are discussed, for example, in Harrison 's Principles of Internal Medicine, Kasper, et al, eds., 16th ed., 2005, Chapter 70, and throughout Part V.\n\n\nFbxw7 Mutations, Detection of Risk of Cancer and mTOR Inhibitor Therapy\n\n\n[0048] In one aspect this invention provides a method of determining if a subject at risk for or diagnosed with cancer should receive mTOR inhibitor therapy, the method involving a step of determining if the Fbxw7 gene is mutated in a patient sample.\n\n\n[0049] In another aspect this invention provides a method of determining if a subject is at risk for cancer is presented. The method involves determining the amounts of mTOR, p- mTOR or one or more downstream components relative to one or more upstream components in a patient sample and comparing the amounts to those obtained in a known sample. The known sample could either be a cancerous sample or a cancer-free sample. The terms upstream and downstream are used in this application are with reference to mTOR in the mTOR signaling pathway. Relatively higher levels of mTOR and /or downstream components could be interpreted as indicative of the subject being at risk for cancer (i.e. through disruption of the Fbxw7 pathway).\n\n\n[0050] In yet another aspect of the invention a method of determining if a subject is at risk for cancer should receive mTOR inhibitor therapy is presented. The method involves determining the amounts of mTOR, p-mTOR or one or more downstream components relative to one or more upstream components in a patient sample and comparing the amounts to those obtained in a known sample. The known sample could either be a cancerous sample or a cancer-free sample. Relatively higher levels of mTOR and/or downstream components may be used as diagnostic tool for presenting mTOR inhibitors. \n\n [0051] If a ratio (quantity of the protein mTOR or its downstream components to amount of upstream components) in a patient sample appears to be greater that that found in a known non-cancerous sample, then the subject may be at a risk for cancer. Preferably the ratio in a positive patient sample are at least 1.5 times those found in a known non-cancerous sample. More preferably they are at least 2.0 times as large and most preferably they are 5.0 times as large.\n\n\n[0052] In one embodiment the patient sample includes any biological sample as described above in the definitions section. Preferably the sample is a biopsy or blood, or saliva. The biological sample may be collected by any of the multiple means known to one of skilled in the art, few of such collection methods are discussed above.\n\n\nUpstream and Downstream Components of mTOR in the mTOR Signaling Pathway\n\n\n[0053] In one embodiment of the invention the upstream component(s) is/are preferably selected from p-Akt, Akt, and PDK and the downstream component(s) is/are preferably selected from p-S6K, 4E-BP and downstream markers of protein translation activity, such as Eif4 family members, Mnkl or Mnk2 .\n\n\nScreening for Active Molecules\n\n\n[0054] In another embodiment a method of assaying for compounds that treat cancer in a subject is disclosed. The method comprising the steps of contacting a cell with one or more candidate compounds, and monitor the effect of said one or more candidate compounds on Fbxw7 gene or protein expression; thereby indentifying said one or more candidate compounds that alters mTOR expression or activity.\n\n\n[0055] The test molecules may be chosen from a compound libraries or from known anticancer agents. Combinations may also be used in the above disclosed screening method. \n\n\n\n\nmTOR Inhibitors and Other Anti-cancer Treatments\n\n\n[0056] In one embodiment of the invention typical mTOR inhibitors can be selected preferably from rapamycin, deforolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus, polymorphs, prodrugs and derivatives thereof. mTOR inhibitors could be as discussed in US Patent Publication no. 2007/0167478. Suitable derivatives of rapamycin could also be as discussed in WO 94/09010, WO 95/16691, WO 96/41807, U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,718 or WO 99/15530. All of the documents listed above are incorporated herein by reference. In addition to the mTOR inhibitors the subject may receive additional treatments if such a treatments are deemed necessary. Additional treatments may involve the use of surgery, anti-cancer agents, radiation, hormonal therapy or immunotherapy.\n\n\n[0057] Examples of anti -cancer agents acceptable for use in the present invention include, without limitation, alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, plant alkaloids and terpenoids, topoisomerase inhibitors, antineoplastics, hormone therapeutics, photosensitizers, kinase inhibitors, etc.\n\n\n[0058] Examples of alkylating agents include, without limitation, cisplatin, caroplatin, oxaliplatin, mechlorethamine, cyclophophamide, chlorambucil, busulfan, hexamethylmelamine, thiotepa, cyclophohphamine, uramustine, melphalan, ifosfamide, carmustine, streptozocin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, etc.\n\n\n[0059] Examples of anti-metabolite agents include, without limitation, Aminopterin, Methotrexate, Pemetrexed, Raltitrexed, Cladribine, Clofarabine, Fludarabine, Mercaptopurine, Pentostatin, Thioguanine, Capecitabine, Cytarabine, Decitabine, Fluorouracil, Floxuridine, Gemcitabine, etc.\n\n\n[0060] Examples of plant alkaloids and terpenoids include, without limitation, Docetaxel, Larotaxel, Paclitaxel, Vinblastine, Vincristine, Vindesine, Vinorelbine, etc.\n\n\n[0061] Examples of topoisomerase inhibitors include, without limitation, Camptothecin, Topotecan, Irinotecan, Rubitecan, Etoposide, Teniposide, etc.\n\n\n[0062] Examples of antineoplastics include, without limitation, Daunorubicin, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, Idarubicin, Mitoxantrone, Pixantrone, Valrubicin, Actinomycin, Bleomycin, Mitomycin, Plicamycin, etc.\n\n\n[0063] Examples of photosensitizer agents include, without limitation, Aminolevulinic acid, Methyl aminolevulinate, Porfimer sodium, Verteporfin, etc. \n\n [0064] Examples of kinase inhibitors include, without limitation, Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, Dasatinib, Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Imatinib, Lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Vandetanib, Seliciclib, etc.\n\n\n[0065] Examples of other anti-cancer agents include, without limitation, Alitretinoin, Tretinoin, Aflibercept, Altretamine, Amsacrine, Anagrelide, Arsenic trioxide, Pegaspargase, Bexarotene, Bortezomib, Celecoxib, Denileukin diftitox, Elesclomol, Estramustine, Irofulven, Ixabepilone, Masoprocol, Mitotane, Oblimersen, Testolactone, Tipifarnib, Trabectedin.\n\n\nDetection of Fbxw7 Gene Mutation\n\n\n[0066] In another embodiment determining Fbxw7 gene mutation can be performed in multiple methods, preferred methods could involve methods such as analysis of the patient DNA, RNA and protein.\n\n\n[0067] In yet another embodiment analysis of the DNA, RNA and protein can be carried out by various means. Preferred means include PCR (e.g., Taqman), sequencing techniques, Southern, western, and northern blots, microarrays, immunohistochemical techniques, ELISA, mass spectroscopy, enzymatic, binding or functional assays.\n\n\n[0068] Preferred methods for the detection and quantification of mTOR, upstream and downstream proteins include western blot, immunohistochemical techniques, ELISA and mass spectroscopy. \n\n\n\n\nRNA and DNA Detection\n\n\n® [0069] PCR assays such as Taqman allelic discrimination assay, available from Applied\n\n\nBiosystems, can be used to identify RNA. In another embodiment, mass spectroscopy can be used to detect either nucleic acid or protein. Any antibody-based technique for determining a level of expression of a protein of interest can be used. For example, immunoassays such as ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry can be used to detect protein in patient samples. Combinations of the above methods, such as\n\n\n® those employed in the Luminex xMAP technology can also be used in the present invention.\n\n\nAnalysis of a protein or nucleic acid can be achieved, for example, by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), alone or in combination with mass spectrometry (e.g., MALDI/MS, MALDI-TOF/MS, tandem MS, etc.).\n\n\n[0070] Applicable PCR amplification techniques are described in, e.g., Ausubel et al and Innis et al , supra. General nucleic acid hybridization methods are described in Anderson, \"Nucleic Acid Hybridization,\" BIOS Scientific Publishers, 1999. Amplification or hybridization of a plurality of nucleic acid sequences {e.g., genomic DNA, mRNA or cDNA) can also be performed from mRNA or cDNA sequences arranged in a microarray. Microarray methods are generally described in Hardiman, \"Microarrays Methods and Applications: Nuts & Bolts,\" DNA Press, 2003; and Baldi et al, \"DNA Microarrays and Gene Expression: From Experiments to Data Analysis and Modeling,\" Cambridge University Press, 2002.\n\n\n[0071] Analysis of nucleic acid markers can be performed using techniques known in the art including, without limitation, sequence analysis, and electrophoretic analysis. Non- limiting examples of sequence analysis include Maxam-Gilbert sequencing, Sanger sequencing, capillary array DNA sequencing, thermal cycle sequencing (Sears et al, Biotechniques, 13:626-633 (1992)), solid-phase sequencing (Zimmerman et al, Methods MoI Cell Biol, 3:39-42 (1992)), single base extension sequencing (SBE), pyrosequencing (Ronaghi et al, Science, 281(5375):363-365 (1998)), sequencing with mass spectrometry such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS; Fu et al, Nat. Biotechnol, 16:381-384 (1998)), and sequencing by hybridization. Chee et al, Science, 274:610-614 (1996); Drmanac et al, Science, 260:1649- 1652 (1993); Drmanac et al, Nat. Biotechnol, 16:54-58 (1998). Non-limiting examples of \n\n electrophoretic analysis include slab gel electrophoresis such as agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nAnalysis of Proteins\n\n\n[0072] In another embodiment, antibody reagents can be used in assays to detect expression levels of protein biomarkers of the invention in patient samples using any of a number of immunoassays known to those skilled in the art. Immunoassay techniques and protocols are generally described in Price and Newman, \"Principles and Practice of Immunoassay,\" 2nd Edition, Grove's Dictionaries, 1997; and Gosling, \"Immunoassays: A Practical Approach,\" Oxford University Press, 2000. A variety of immunoassay techniques, including competitive and non-competitive immunoassays, can be used (see, e.g., Self et al., Curr. Opin. BiotechnoL, 7:60-65 (1996)). The term immunoassay encompasses techniques including, without limitation, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) such as enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC ELISA), and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA); capillary electrophoresis immunoassays (CEIA); radioimmunoassays (RIA); immunoradiometric assays (IRMA); fluorescence polarization immunoassays (FPIA); and chemiluminescence assays (CL). If desired, such immunoassays can be automated. Immunoassays can also be used in conjunction with laser induced fluorescence (see, e.g., Schmalzing et al., Electrophoresis, 18:2184-93 (1997); Bao, J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. ScL, 699:463-80 (1997)). Liposome immunoassays, such as flow-injection liposome immunoassays and liposome immunosensors, are also suitable for use in the present invention (see, e.g., Rongen et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 204:105-133 (1997)). In addition, nephelometry assays, in which the formation of protein/antibody complexes results in increased light scatter that is converted to a peak rate signal as a function of the marker concentration, are suitable for use in the methods of the present invention. Nephelometry assays are commercially available from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA; Kit #449430) and can be performed using a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer (Fink et al., J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem., 27:261-276 (1989)).\n\n\n[0073] Specific immunological binding of the antibody to a protein can be detected directly or indirectly. Direct labels include fluorescent or luminescent tags, metals, dyes, radionuclides, and the like, attached to the antibody. An antibody labeled with iodine- 125\n\n\n12\n5\n \n\n\n( I) can be used. A chemiluminescence assay using a chemiluminescent antibody specific for the protein marker is suitable for sensitive, non-radioactive detection of protein levels. An antibody labeled with fluorochrome is also suitable. Examples of fluorochromes include, \n\n without limitation, DAPI, fluorescein, Hoechst 33258, R-phycocyanin, B-phycoerythrin, R- phycoerythrin, rhodamine, Texas red, and lissamine. Indirect labels include various enzymes well known in the art, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), y- galactosidase, urease, and the like. A horseradish-peroxidase detection system can be used, for example, with the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which yields a soluble product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide that is detectable at 450 nm. An alkaline phosphatase detection system can be used with the chromogenic substrate p- nitrophenyl phosphate, for example, which yields a soluble product readily detectable at 405 nm. Similarly, a β-galactosidase detection system can be used with the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), which yields a soluble product detectable at 410 nm. An urease detection system can be used with a substrate such as urea- bromocresol purple (Sigma Immunochemicals; St. Louis, MO).\n\n\n[0074] A signal from a direct or indirect label can be analyzed, for example, using a spectrophotometer to detect color from a chromogenic substrate; a radiation counter to detect radiation such as a gamma counter for detection of I; or a fluorometer to detect fluorescence in the presence of light of a certain wavelength. For detection of enzyme-linked antibodies, a quantitative analysis can be made using a spectrophotometer such as an EMAX Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices; Menlo Park, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If desired, the assays of the present invention can be automated or performed robotically, and the signal from multiple samples can be detected simultaneously.\n\n\n[0075] The antibodies can be immobilized onto a variety of solid supports, such as polystyrene beads, magnetic or chromatographic matrix particles, the surface of an assay plate (e.g., microtiter wells), pieces of a solid substrate material or membrane (e.g., plastic, nylon, paper), and the like. An assay strip can be prepared by coating the antibody or a plurality of antibodies in an array on a solid support. This strip can then be dipped into the test sample and processed quickly through washes and detection steps to generate a measurable signal, such as a colored spot.\n\n\n[0076] Immunohistochemical (IHC) methods, which are well known by those skilled in the art, may be used . See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,441,143 to Koski et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,201 to Miron et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,712 to Cheever et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,009 to Klug, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,684 to Levine et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,603 to Slamon et al. \n\n and \"DAKO anti-Her2 IHC System for Immunoenzymatic Staining\" (Package Insert) DAKO Corporation. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,573,043 to Cohen et al, two general methods of IHC are available: direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay, binding of an antibody to the target antigen is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent, such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme-labeled primary antibody, which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. The fluorescent tag or label can be fluorescein. The enzymatic label can be horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\n[0077] In a typical indirect assay, unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label, a chromagenic or fluorogenic substrate can be added to provide visualization of the antigen. Such are described above. Signal amplification may occur because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody. The primary and/or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically can be labeled with a detectable moiety. IHC techniques are further described in Immunohistochemical Staining Methods. Thomas Boenisch, ed. (3rd ed. 2001).\n\n\nPhysical Formats\n\n\n[0078] Useful physical formats comprise surfaces having a plurality of discrete, addressable locations for the detection of a plurality of different biomarkers. Such formats include protein microarrays, or \"protein chips\" (see, e.g., Ng et al., J. Cell MoI. Med., 6:329- 340 (2002)) and certain capillary devices (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,019,944). In these embodiments, each discrete surface location may comprise antibodies to immobilize one or more protein markers for detection at each location. Surfaces may alternatively comprise one or more discrete particles (e.g., microparticles or nanoparticles) immobilized at discrete locations of a surface, where the microparticles comprise antibodies to immobilize one or more protein markers for detection.\n\n\n[0079] Analysis of the level of a biomarker can be carried out in a variety of physical formats. For example, the use of microtiter plates or automation could be used to facilitate the processing of large numbers of test samples. Alternatively, single sample formats could be developed to facilitate diagnosis or prognosis in a timely fashion.\n\n\n[0080] Alternatively, the antibodies or nucleic acid probes of the invention can be applied to sections of patient biopsies immobilized on microscope slides. The resulting antibody \n\n staining or in situ hybridization pattern can be visualized using any one of a variety of light or fluorescent microscopic methods known in the art.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n[0081] Genome-wide search: The Fbxw7 gene has been identified as a p53-deρendent tumor suppressor gene that undergoes deletion and/or mutation in tumors from a wide range of human tissues, including breast, colon, endometrium, stomach, lung, ovary, pancreas, and prostate (Welcker M. et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 8:83-93 (2008); and Akhoondi S. et al, Cancer Res. 67:9006-12 (2007)). Point mutations in FBXW7 were reported to be the most common genetic lesions in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), indicating a wide role for this protein in suppression of most forms of human malignancies. The overall point mutation frequency of FBXW7 is about 6% (Akhoondi S. et al., Cancer Res. 67:9006-12 (2007)), but since Fbxw7 is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor (Mao J. H. et al., Nature 432:775-9 (2004)) and deletions at 4q are relatively frequent in human cancers (Mitelman F. et al., Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer (2007)), the impact of loss of FBXW7 in human cancers may have been underestimated.\n\n\n[0082] The mechanism that is primarily responsible for suppression of tumor development by FBXW7 remains largely unclear. FBXW7 encodes an F-box protein essential for ubiquitination of several well-defined oncoproteins including Myc, Cyclin E, c-Jun, Notch and Aurora-A (Welcker M et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 8:83-93 (2008)). While loss 0ΪFBXW7 has been associated with increased genetic instability through deregulation of Cyclin E (Rajagopalan H. et al., Nature 428: 77-81 (2004)), c-Myc (Yada M. et al., EMBO J. 23: 2116- 25 (2004); and Welcker M. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 101 :9085-90 (2004)) or Aurora- A (Mao J. H. et al., Nature 432:775-9 (2004)), some studies failed to find this correlation, suggesting that additional mechanisms may involve other pathways (Kemp Z. et al., Cancer Res. 65:11361-6 (2005)). Therefore a genome-wide search was carried out for potentially novel Fbxw7 ubiquitination targets using the consensus CDC phosphodegron (CPD) sequence I/L-I/L/P-T-P-XXXX (where lysine and arginine are unfavorable in the X locations) (Welcker M. et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 8:83-93 (2008)) in a mouse protein database (http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus). This search revealed a strong match to the consensus sequence within the HEAT domain of mTor (Figure 1). The mTor CPD region is \n\n evolutionarily conserved in different species ranging from humans to zebra fish (Figure 2), suggesting its potential functional importance.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n[0083] Depletion of Fbxw7 leads to increase of mTOR: mTOR is a central component of several complex signaling networks that regulate cell growth, metabolism and proliferation. Deregulation of mTOR is emerging as common theme in diverse human conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and ageing, and several drugs targeting this pathway are presently in clinical trials. The possibility that Fbxw7 may directly regulate levels of mTor was tested by analyzing two independent preparations of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Fbxw7+/- mice (Figure 3A). Depletion of Fbxw7 increased the levels of both total mTor and phosphorylated mTor (p-mTor), as well as the downstream mTor target S6- kinase (P-S6). In contrast, there was no appreciable effect on upstream components of the mTor signaling pathway such as Akt and phosphorated Akt (p-Akt) (Figure 3 A, lower panels).\n\n\n[0084] Depletion of Fbxw7 in vivo also leads to an increase in both mTor and p-mTor protein levels. Thymus and spleen from FbXwT\n+1'\n mice (lanes 3, Figure 3B) showed increased mTor and p-mTor in comparison with control wild type tissue (lanes 1, Figure 3B). In contrast, levels of total Akt and p-Akt (at Ser437) do not change appreciably (Figure 3B). However in Pten\n+/~\n mice (lanes 2, Figure 3B), both thymus and spleen showed an increase in p-mTor without any obvious change in total mTor protein level. In agreement with these observations, p-Akt levels were elevated in thymus and spleen from Pten\n+I~\n mice and presumably were responsible for activation of mTor signaling (Figure 3B).\n\n\n[0085] A similar trend was seen in human cells from which the FBXW7 gene has been deleted by homologous recombination (Rajagopalan H. et al., Nature 428: 77-81 (2004)). Both HCTl 16 and DLDl cells that lack FBXW7 have slightly higher levels of mTOR and p- mTOR, as well as increased levels of p-S6K (Figure 3C). Again, no effect was seen on the upstream targets AKT and p-AKT (Figure 3C, lower panels). The effect seen in these human cells is weaker than in the mouse, possibly because these are fully transformed human tumor cell lines that can upregulate mTOR levels by additional mechanisms.\n\n\n[0086] The possibility that downregulation of FBXW7 using a dominant negative approach would lead to increased levels of mTOR was also tested. Human 293 T cells were transfected with a dominant-negative form of FBXW7 comprising a truncated FBXW7 protein that \n\n contains only the WD40 domain (HA-FBXW7-ΔF) (Wu G. et al., J. MoI Cell Biol. 21:7403- 15 (2001)). Cells transfected with HA-FBXW7-ΔF showed an increase in the level of both total mTOR and p-mTOR (Figure 3D). Cells expressing the transfected normal HA-FBXW7 protein reproducibly had lower levels of both total mTOR and p-mTOR in comparison to cells containing only the empty vector (Figure 3D). In contrast, levels of AKT and p-AKT were not affected by overexpression of FBXW7 (Figure 3D).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n[0087] Interactions between mTOR and FBXW7 proteins: Possible direct interactions between mTOR and FBXW7 proteins were ivestigated. A vector encoding HA-tagged FBXW7 was transfected into 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against the HA tag, and Western blot analysis using anti-mTOR antibodies. The reciprocal experiment was also carried out in which mTOR was immunoprecipitated, followed by blotting with the anti-HA antibody. Both approaches demonstrated direct interaction between the mTOR and FBXW7 proteins (Figure 4A). To further confirm that the interaction site of FBXW7 is within the WD40 domain, 293T cells were transfected with the truncated construct HA-FBXW7-ΔF. Immunoprecipitation of one protein followed by Western blot analysis of the second revealed a strong interaction between mTOR and FBXW7-ΔF (Figure 4A), suggesting that the WD40 domain of FBXW7 is the interaction site. [0088] The consensus CPD site in human mTOR is located around T631 (Figure 1). A fragment of mTOR (from 1 to 898 AAs) that contains the putative CPD was cloned, two mutants were generated, one carrying a deletion of T631 [mTOR(delT631)], and the other a point mutation converting T631 to G [mTOR(T63 IG)] (all with Flag tags) (Figure 4B). The wild type and mutant versions of this mTOR fragment were co-expressed with HA-FBXW7 in 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against one protein and Western blot analysis of the second. Although the wild type fragment of mTOR immunoprecipitated efficiently with FBXW7, binding to the mTOR (delT631) and mTOR(T63 IG) mutants was dramatically reduced (Figure 4C). In repeat experiments by two different investigators, both mutants retained some residual binding to FBXW7 in these co- transfection assays, suggesting it is possible to present an additional, but weaker, consensus binding site in mTOR.. These data demonstrate that FBXW7 binds mTOR predominantly through the major conserved CPD site. \n\n Example 4\n\n\n[0089] Regulation of mTOR by FBXW7: In order to determine whether the regulation of mTOR by FBXW7 is through the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway, MCF7 and SUM149PT cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. MCF7 cells are widely used breast epithelial cells that express a wild type FBXWl gene, while SUM 149PT cells were derived from a breast carcinoma and have undergone homozygous mutation of FBXWl (Strohmaier H. et al., Nature. 413, 316-22 (2001) and Table 1). Proteasome inhibition caused a dramatic increase in the mTOR levels in MCF7 cells, which retain FBXWl, but not in SUM147PT cells (Figure 4D), suggesting that degradation of mTOR is FBXW7 -dependent. Whether the ubiquitination status of mTOR was FBXW7-dependent was also examined. In these experiments, 293T and SUM 149PT were transfected with a vector containing CMV promoter-driven HA-ubiquitin. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR followed by Western blot analysis of the HA-ubiquitin showed that mTOR ubiquitination was found only in cells retaining a functional FBXWl gene (Figure 4E). To exclude the possibility that other differences between 293T and SUM 149PT cells may account for this effect, the experiments using HCTl 16_WT and HCTl 16_FBXW7-/- cells (Figure 4F) were repeated. The results showed again that efficient ubiquitination of mTOR was only seen in the HCTl 16_WT cells, and not in HCTl 16_FBXW7-/- cells. Finally, SUM149PT cells were co-transfected with constructs encoding both FBXW7 and HA-ubiquitin, and it was found that ubiquitination of mTOR was restored by exogenous FBXW7 expression (Figure 4G). It is concluded that ubiquitination of mTOR is largely, if not exclusively, mediated by binding to FBXW7. \n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: NC = no change *position start from ATG\n\n\n[0090] The above results have revealed a possible genetic and functional relationship between Fbxw7 and the tumor suppressor Pten. Both genes can be deleted in human or mouse tumors, and deletion of either gene leads to activation and/or over-expression of mTOR. To explore the genetic relationship between FBXWl and PTEN in human cancers, the genetic status of both genes in a panel of 53 breast cancer cell lines that have been extensively characterized by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) and gene expression microarray analyses (Neve R. M., Cancer Cell 10:515-27 (2006)) were examined. Quantitative TaqMan assays for both FBXWl and PTEN genes were developed to quantify the number of copies in each of the cell lines. The TaqMan results were in good concordance with data found by BAC CGH Microarray using the BAC clones that lie close to the locations \n\n OΪFBXW7 and PTEN in the human genome (see Table 1). Surprisingly, it was found that tumors with deletions of one copy of PTEN frequently had no deletion at the FBXW7 locus, and vice versa. The data in Figure 3 A show that most of the breast cancer cell lines that exhibited loss of a single copy of FBXW7 (23 out of 53, shown in lighter-gray in the FBXW7 column, Figure 5A) did not show corresponding loss of PTEN. In contrast, of the 14 out of 55 lines that showed loss of a single copy of PTEN (lighter-gray bars in the PTEN column, Figure 5A), only one had also lost a copy of FBXW7, suggesting FBXW7 and PTEN show some functional redundancy in tumor development. Some of the cell lines showed copy number gains (in darker-gray) of either FBXW7 or PTEN.\n\n\n[0091] To confirm these observations in human primary breast cancers, the gene copy number status of FBXW7 and PTEN in three independent human primary breast cancer sets were analyzed; which have been analyzed using the same BAC CGH microarray platform (Climent J. etal., Cancer Res. 67:818-26 (2007); Chin K., Cancer Cell. 10:529-41 (2006); and Fridlyand J., BMC Cancer. 6:96 (2006)). As shown in Figures 5B to 5D, essentially the same patterns were found in all of these tumor panels. In the breast cancers (Figures 5B, C, and D) a total of only 4 tumors had lost a copy of both genes, as shown by the juxtaposition of the lighter-gray bars in both FBXW7 and PTEN columns. The chance of this occurring as a consequence of random genetic alterations in the genomes of a total of 450 tumor and cell line DNA samples is extremely small (p= 4.9 x 10\n\"7\n). A similar trend was seen in a panel of 113 primary colon tumors, although the significance of these correlations was not as strong (p=0.025; Kim, I-J. et al, data not shown).\n\n\n[0092] The possibility that other somatic changes such as point mutations or gene silencing events could impact the results was also considered. RNA expression levels for FBXW7 and PTEN in 25 breast cancer cell lines were analyzed and sequence analysis of the complete coding regions of both genes in these cell lines was also carried out. In all cases, the FBXW7 gene continued to be expressed (Figure 6), indicating that no gene silencing had occurred, although very low levels were found in 5 cells lines (lanes 10, 13, 14, 16, 20; Figure 6). All of these lines had lost one copy of the FBXW7 gene except one (SUM 149PT, lane 16), in which a point mutation was detected (table 1). The PTEN gene was found to be silent in two cell lines (Figure 6, lane 11 and 12), and both had lost one copy of the PTEN gene. Three mutations in PTEN were found (in cell lines MDA-MB-415, BT549 and MDA-MB-468, lanes 15, 17 and 24, Figure 6, and table 1). All of these data, taken together, suggest that gene silencing (for example by promoter methylation) or point mutations in FBXW7 and \n\n PTEN axe relatively rare mechanisms of inactivation of these genes, in comparison to single copy deletions. These data are further compatible with the identification of both genes as haplo-insufficient tumor suppressors (Mao J. H., Nature 432:775-9 (2004); and Di Cristofano A. et al., Nat Genet. 19:348-55 (1998)) that generally do not require complete inactivation of both gene copies.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n[0093] Rapamycin treatment: On the basis of the observation that deletion or mutation of FBXW7 in human breast cancer cells leads to increased levels of mTOR, the possibility that cells harboring these deletions may show increased sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was tested. Two breast cancer cell lines, SUM 149PT cells (homozygous FBXWl mutations) and MDA-MB453 cells (wild type FBXW7) were treated with rapamycin and counted numbers of viable cells using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent assay. SUM 149PT cells proved to be very sensitive to this treatment (IC\n50\n < 200 nM), whereas MDA-MB453 cells were relatively resistant (IC\n50\n > 2 μM). This relative difference in sensitivity in vitro was also apparent in nude mouse xenografts of both cell lines (Figure 7B). Groups of 5 mice were injected with both cell lines, one on each flank, and were treated by intraperitoneal injection with Rapamycin over an 11-day time period, starting 8 days after tumor inoculation. The SUM 149PT cells showed a relative decrease in size followed by stable tumor growth, whereas the MDAMB453 cells were relatively unaffected by treatment.\n\n\n[0094] An additional set of 10 breast cancer cell lines were treated with rapamycin at concentrations of 200 nM and 400 nM. Interestingly, cells with deletion or mutation of FBXW7 (HBLlOO, 600MPE, SUM149PT, HCC3153 and HCCl 143) showed significant sensitivity to killing by rapamycin, although the magnitude of the effect varied. Some cells with loss or mutation of PTEN (HCC1937 and HCC3153) were sensitive to rapmycin, consistent with what has been reported in literature (Figure 7C). To establish a direct link between loss of FBXW7 and rapamycin sensitivity, shRNA specific for FBXWl were used (Welcker M. et al., Curr Biol. 14:1852-7 (2004)) to downregulate expression levels of the target protein in the rapamycin-resistant MDA-MB453 cells. As shown in Figure 4D, MDA- MB453 cells expressing FBXW7-specific shRNA are markedly more sensitive to rapamycin treatment (IC\n50\n< 0.8μM) than the parental cells. Similar results were obtained with two additional cell lines expressing the FBXW7 shRNA (Figures 7E to F). \n\n [0095] These findings implicate FBXW7 in an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls regulation of mTOR protein levels. Since Fbxw7 is itself a transcriptional target of p53, these data establish another link between the p53 and Pten signaling networks. Since FBXW7 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that undergoes heterozygous loss in a substantial proportion of human tumours, the data suggest new approaches to reduce mTOR levels in cancers by the use of drugs that may re-activate the remaining copy of Fbxw7 in a similar way that nutlins have been shown to activate wild type copies of p53 in human tumors (Buolamwini J. K. et al., Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 5:57-68 (2005)). Loss of FBXW7 may also be a useful biomarker for sensitivity of human tumors to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway. \n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods Cell culture\n\n\n[0096] Breast cancer cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joe Gray (Neve R.M. et al., Cancer Cell 10:515-27 (2006)). Stocks of the earliest-passage cells have been stored. HCTl 16, HCTl 16 FBXW7-/-, DLDl, and DLDl FBXW7-/- cell lines were a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein.\n\n\nWestern blotting\n\n\n[0097] Total protein extracts were prepared from MEFs, cancer cells, and tissues with RIPA lysis buffer. For western blots, 50μg of protein extracts per lane were electrophoresed, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted with AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), p-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology), p- mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology), p-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology), and HA (Covance) antibodies; as control, the same membranes were stripped and immunoblotted again with anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15, Sigma). The membranes were washed and treated with rat anti- species IgG \nκ\n -chain secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia). The antigen -antibody reactions were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminesence assay ECL (Amersham Pharmacia) and exposed to enhanced chemiluminesence film.\n\n\nImmunoprecipitation\n\n\n[0098] 293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 expressing HA tagged FBXW7 and FBXW7-ΔF respectively using Fugene (Roche). The cells were harvested 24 hours after the transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 or 0.25% dodecyl beta D maltoside in Ix PBS with protease inhibitors) incubated on ice for 60 min and centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was estimated with the Pierce BCA assay reagent. 500μg of lysates were precleared with protein A-sepharose beads (Invitrogen) and incubated with 2 μg of antibody overnight. Addition of protein A sepharose beads with incubation for 3-4 hour followed. After the incubation, the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer described above and the precipitates were subjected to Western blotting as below. For the immunoprecipitation with anti HA antibody, Profound HA Tag IP/Co-IP kit (Pierce) was used according to the instruction manual. \n\n TaqMan assay\n\n\n[00991 We designed TaqMan primers and probes using the Primer Express Oligo Design Software vl.O (Applied Biosystems). Probes are FAM probes designed specifically for TaqMan (Applied Biosystems). All primer sets were used to perform amplifications in triplicate on the ABI 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Reactions (50 μl) were performed in 1 xTaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1.6 nM primer, 0.4 nM probe, 12.5 ng DNA. Cycling parameters were as follows: 95°C for 12 min χl cycle, (95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s, 72°C for 60 s) χ40 cycles. Copy number was determined from the PCR cycle number (CT) at which DNAs reach a threshold amount of fluorescence above background. To normalize for differences in the amount of total input DNA, amplification at a reference locus is performed once per plate in triplicate for each individual DNA. The CT values for each set of triplicates are averaged. The Ct of the pooled reference is subtracted from the CT for each locus to obtain the ΔCT (ΔCT=CT (locus)-CT (reference)). ΔCt values are determined for locus in tumor samples and a set of six normal genomic DNAs. The average of the six ΔCT values (ΔCT(normal)) measured from the normal DNAs was calculated once for each locus in the study and used in the subsequent calculations for all experiments performed on a single ABI 7700. ΔΔCT-ΔCt (tumor)-Average ΔCT (normal). If ΔΔCT>0.5, it means gain; If ΔΔCT<- 0.5, it means loss.\n\n\nViable cell count analysis\n\n\n[0100] Cell number was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and luminescence was recorded with a luminometer (BioTek FLx800, BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The cells are seeded in 96 well plates and exposed to mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (100 nM to 2 μM) for 72 hours. The number of cells used per experiment is determined empirically. Each cell line and drug concentration will be set up in 6 replicate wells and repeated at least 3 times. \n\n shRNA constructs and retrovirus production\n\n\n[0101] A shRNA with high FBXW7 knockdown efficiency was cloned into pSuper retrovirus cassettes (OligoEngine). The shRNA sequences for FBXW7 are\n\n\nGTGTGGAATGCAGAGACTGGAGA (17). The breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB453, LY2 and MCF7) were infected with high-titre retroviral stocks produced by the transient transfection of 293T ecotropic Phonix cells. After infection with the pSuper retrovirus allowing the expression of shRNA molecules, cells were selected with l-2μg /ml of puromycin in the culture medium. The control of the experiment was pSuper vector without RNAi.\n\n\nPlasmids and mutagenesis\n\n\n[0102] The fragment of human mTOR was amplified from human cDNA by PCR using the primers (CCCAAGCTTGAACCTCAGGGCAAGATGCT) and\n\n\n(GCTCTAGATTAGATCCAAAGCCCCTAAAAGC). The fragment was digested with HindIII and Xbal, and cloned into the Hindlll-Xbal site of the p3XFLAG-CMV-10 expression vector. The two mutants (delT631 and T631G) were generated by in vitro site- directed mutagenesis using QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). The primers for delT631 mutagenesis are\n\n\nTCCCGCCTGCTCCCCTCCATCCAC and GTGGATGGAGGGGAGCAGGCGGGA, for T631G, CTCCCGCCTGCTCGGACCCTCCATCCAC and GTGGATGGAGGGTCCGAGCAGGCGGGAG. All constructs were verified by sequencing.\n\n\nNude mice injection\n\n\n[0103] 5xlO\n6\n SUM149PT cells and 5xlO\n6\n MDA-Mb453 cells was injected subcutaneously in 10 nude mice in opposing flanks. 8 days after inoculation, 10 nude mice was divided into two groups, one was treated with rapamycin daily (4mg per kg body weight) for 11 days, the other with placebo. Tumor sizes were measured with a caliper every two days. The tumor volume will be calculated using the formula: Volume= S\nχ\nS*L/2, where s is the short length of the tumor in mm and L is the long length of the tumor in mm.\n\n\n[0104] It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.

The reference sequence was derived from BF514288.1, W39194.1,\n\n\nAY049984.1 and AC080078.7.\n\n\nOn Mar 24, 2005 this sequence version replaced gi: 16117780.\n\n\nSummary: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the\n\n\nF-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of \n\n ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKPl-cullin-F- box) , which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-\n\n\n40 domains, FbIs containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene was previously referred to as FBX30, and belongs to the Fbws class; in addition to an F-box, this protein contains 7 tandem WD40 repeats. This protein binds directly to cyclin E and probably targets cyclin E for ubiguitin-mediated degradation. Mutations in this gene are detected in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, implicating the gene ' s potential role in the pathogenesis of human cancers .\n\n\nThree transcript variants encoding three different isoforms have been found for this gene, [provided by RefSeq] .\n\n\nTranscript Variant: This variant (1) represents the longest transcript and encodes the longest isoform (1) .\n\n\nPublication Note: This RefSeq record includes a subset of the publications that are available for this gene.

Description\n\n\n\n\nNEW USE OF SIXTH IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE DOMAIN OF VCAM-1\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a use of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and more particularly, relates to a method of inhibiting activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 to inhibit the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell, and thereby preventing or treating VCAM-1 mediated-diseases using the same. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn inflammatory responses, cell adhesion molecules play a key role in promoting the binding of leukocytes or lymphocytes to activated endothelium, allowing transmigration and then, ultimately, inducing severe damage to cells or tissues. In response to inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cells up-regulate the expression of various adhesion molecules, such as E- and P-selectins and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily including intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, -2, and -3, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). \n\n\n \n\n\nAmong these, VCAM-1 (CD106) is dominantly and inducibly expressed on endothelial cells upon activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interferon-γ (IFNγ), hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). \n\n\n \n\n\nMany increasing reports have been suggested the potential role of VCAM-1 to be closely involved in the progression of various inflammatory disorders including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, by us and other colleagues, the possible relevance of VCAM-1 on inflammatory response in organ- or islet transplantation has been also suggested.\n\n\n \n\n\nAccording to many increasing reports, VCAM-1 and α4β1 integrin play a key role in leukocyte trafficking of many inflammatory responses. Although so far much attention has been paid to α4β1 integrin as a therapeutic intervention for inflammatory disorders, however, currently, VCAM-1 may be a better molecular target for generating therapeutic antibody for the following reasons: First, Natalizumab, an antibody to α4β1 integrin, was initially reported to be effective in the prevention of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, but has proven to have the risk of developing proessive multifocal leukoencephalophathy. Second, α4β1 integrin has many binding partners other than VCAM-1, like paxillin, osteopontin, thrombospondin-1, fibronectin, and junctional adhesion molecule-2 (JAM-2). Due to this, application of anti-α4β1 integrin antibody may be relatively incomplete in suppressing inflammatory responses or cause certain side effects. Third, VCAM-1 is exclusively expressed on activated endothelial cells whereas leukocytes/lymphocytes expressing α4β1 integrin exist in whole human body through blood stream. Thus, it is expected that anti-VCAM-1 antibody can be locally effective to inflamed endothelial cells with inflammation among blood vessels. Therefore, developing antibody specific to VCAM-1 may be critical for specifically alleviating VCAM-1-mediated inflammatory responses.\n\n\n \n\n\nVCAM-1 is critical for the progression of many inflammatory disorders including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplantation rejection. Despite of much progress about the functional role of VCAM-1, so far, most antibodies specific to VCAM-1 have a limit to lack broad cross-species reactivity. For example, although rat anti-mVCAM-1 specific mAb (clone MK2.7) has been demonstrated to reduce collagen-induced arthritis and islet allograft rejection, it is only specific to mouse VCAM-1. Other mouse anti-hVCAM-1 specific mAb (clone 1.4C3) was also reported. To this end, the development of a VCAM-1 specific mAb having broad cross-species reactivity is required to simultaneously crystallize information from various in vitro and animal studies.\n\n\n \n\n\nVCAM-1 consists of extracellular domain containing seven immunoglobulin (IgG)-like domains, transmembrane domain, and cytosolic domain. Especially, among seven IgG-like domains of VCAM-1, the first and fourth IgG-like domains in the extracellular domain are important for binding to very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), α4β1 integrin, expressed on monocytes/macrophages or T lymphocytes in various inflammatory responses. However, so far, it has not clearly identified about the functional role of the other IgG-like domains of VCAM-1 domain yet. So far, many studies have focused on the functional significance of the interaction between the first and fourth homologous domains of VCAM-1 and α4β1 integrin in inflammatory responses. However, this interaction has been also known to be closely involved in normal physiology including B cell development, tissue regeneration by stem cells, and muscle development. In this regards, the identification of the other domain of VCAM-1 not inhibiting both interactions but leukocytes/lymphocytes trafficking may be more essential for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory responses. \n\n\n \n\n\nIn the present study, we for the first time developed anti-VCAM-1 mAb specific to the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 using phage display technology. With this mAb, we found that the sixth IgG-like domain is important for the transmigration of U937 human monocytic cell lines across activated HUVECs, regardless of the interaction between α4β1 integrin and VCAM-1. Finally, we also demonstrated that the with mouse islet allograft model, the sixth IgG-like domain could be a new molecular target for alleviating inflammatory responses in vivo. In summary, this study suggests that the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 may be a new therapeutic target for alleviating VCAM-1-mediated inflammatory responses. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for inhibiting the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell by inhibiting activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).\n\n\n \n\n\nAnother purpose of the present invention is to provide a method of preventing or treating VCAM-1 mediated-diseases by inhibiting activity of  the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).\n\n\n \n\n\nAnother purpose of the present invention is to provide a kit for screening materials treating or preventing VCAM-1 mediated-diseases, comprising the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and a kit for the same.  \n\n\n \n\n\nAnother purpose of the present invention is to provide a method of screening VCAM-1 mediated-diseases treatment or prevention materials, comprising the steps of: (1) contacting a patient of VCAM-1 mediated-diseases patient with a sample; (2) detecting increase or decrease of activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expressed on activated endothelial cell; and (3) determining the sample that inhibits activity as a VCAM-1 mediated-diseases treatment or prevention materials.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHereinafter, the present invention is explained in more detail.\n\n\nAs an aspect for achieving the above purposes, the present invention provides A method for inhibiting the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell by inhibiting activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).\n\n\n \n\n\nIt should be understood that the definitions of terms used hereunder are provided to more clearly explain the aspects of the present invention, and to depict embodiments of specific aspects, and thus do not regarded as being used for limiting the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nVarious definitions are used throughout this document.

For example, inhibition of a biological activity refers to a decrease in a biological activity. \n\n\n \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"inhibit\" refers to a reduction, decrease, inactivation or down-regulation of an activity or quantity. For example, in the present invention, modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 can inhibit at least one of the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell; VCAM-1 mediated signal after the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell;  generation, amplification, residue,  transference or transplantation rejection of VCAM-1 mediated disease.

Inhibition of the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell or the extent of the inhibition can be measured by assays containing transendothelial cell migration assay, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry, but it will not be limited thereto and can be measured using various assays known in this art. By inhibiting the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell, the signal progress after transmigration is inhibited, and one of the resulted effects include prevention and treatment of VCAM-1 mediated diseases.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the above description, the phrase “does not affect the binding of leukocyte across endothelial cell” means that no change can be found in the binding and the extent thereof, when compared to a case where the activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 is inhibited. It has the same meaning as the phrase “do not inhibit the binding of leukocyte to endothelial cell” below described. The binding can be measured using various methods known in this art, for example, by labeling leukocyte or labeling expression of integrin in leukocyte, and measuring the labeled extent on the endothelial cell using fluorescence plate reader or flow cytometry. In such a case, labeling can be performed using a fluorescent probe, such as, CFSE(carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) or CFDA-SE(carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester), but it will not be limited thereto.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention,\n\n\nTo investigate the role of the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 on the transmigration of leukocyte, HUVECs(human umbilical vein endothelial cells) plated on the transwell were incubated in the absence or presence of hTNFα(human tumor necrosis factor alpha). Then, transendothelial cell migration assay was performed with U937 human monocytic cell lines in the absence or presence of anti-VCAM-1 Fab. As shown in Fig. 3, inventors found that anti-VCAM-1 mAb could significantly inhibit the transmigration of U937 cells across activated HUVECs.\n\n\nTo further verify the role of the sixth IgG-like domain on VCAM-1-α4β1 interaction, we first generated vector- or hVCAM-1-\noverexpressing HEK\n 293 cell lines (Fig. 4A). Then, inventors performed neutralizing assay with those HEK293 cell lines, HAEC(human aortic endotheluial cells), and HUVEC and CSFE-labeled U937 in the absence or presence of anti-VCAM-1 mAb. As shown in Fig. 4B-4C, inventors found that this mAb little affect the VCAM-1-mediated binding of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition of activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 can be accomplished by a modulator of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. \n\n\nIn some embodiments, modulator of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 comprises an oligonucleotide, a small molecule, a chemical compound, a decoy, or an antibody. In some embodiments, modulator of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 inhibits a biological activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 by 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%, as compared to a control.

In some embodiments the modulator acts by blocking ligand binding or by competing for a ligand-binding site. In some embodiments the modulator acts independently of ligand binding. In some embodiments the moulators can block or compete VCAM-1 complex formation that can lead to the activation of VCAM-1 downstream signaling. The modulators inhibit activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 and thereby inhibiting at least one of the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell; VCAM-1 mediated signal after the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell; generation, amplification, residue, transference or transplantation rejection of VCAM-1 mediated disease, or inhibiting expression of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. \n\n\n \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, bifunctional/bispecif[iota]c antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, and complementary determining region (CDR)- grafted antibodies, that are specific for the target protein or fragments thereof. The term \"antibody\" further includes in vivo therapeutic antibody gene transfer. Antibody fragments, including Fab, Fab ', F(ab ')2, . scFv,- and Fv are also provided by the invention. \n\n\n \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"epitope\" refers to an antigenic determinant of a polypeptide. In some embodiments an epitope may comprise 3 or more amino acids in a spatial conformation which is unique to the epitope. In some embodiments epitopes are linear or conformational epitopes. Generally an epitope consists of at least 4, at least 6, at least 8, at least 10, and at least 12 such amino acids, and more usually, consists of at least 8-10 such amino acids. Methods of determining the spatial conformation of amino acids are known in the art, and include, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn some embodiments modulator of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1  is a monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a human antibody, a humanized antibody, a single-chain antibody, or a Fab fragment. The antibody may be labeled with, for example, an enzyme, radioisotope, or fluorophore. \n\n\nThe invention also provides antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of an antibody to an epitope of the invention as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding using, for example, immunoassays. In some embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding to the epitope by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50%. \n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention may function through different mechanisms. In some embodiments, antibodies have multiple therapeutic functions, including, for example, antigen-binding, the induction of inhibition of VCAM-1 complex formation and transmigration of leukocytes across activated endothelial cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may act as antagonists of the polypeptides of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. For example, in some embodiments the present invention provides antibodies which disrupt the receptor/ligand interactions with the polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. In some embodiments antibodies of the present invention bind an epitope disclosed herein, or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, antibodies are provided that modulate ligand activity or receptor activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50% compared to the activity in the absence of the antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalently and non- covalently conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs,- radionuclides, or toxins. \n\n\n \n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be prepared using the method of Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256:495-496, or a modification thereof. Typically, a mouse is immunized with a solution containing an antigen. Immunization can be performed by mixing or emulsifying the antigen-containing solution in saline, preferably in an adjuvant such as Freund's complete adjuvant, and injecting the mixture or emulsion parenterally. Any method of immunization known in the art may be used to obtain the monoclonal antibodies of the invention. After immunization of the animal, the spleen (and optionally, several large lymph nodes) are removed and dissociated into single cells. The spleen cells may be screened by applying a cell suspension to a plate or well coated with the antigen of interest. The B cells expressing membrane bound immunoglobulin specific for the antigen bind to the plate and are not rinsed away. Resulting B cells, or all dissociated spleen cells, are then induced to fuse with myeloma cells to form hybridomas, and are cultured in a selective medium. The resulting cells are plated by serial or limiting dilution and are assayed for the production of antibodies that specifically bind the antigen of interest (and that do not bind to unrelated antigens). The selected monoclonal antibody (mAb)-secreting hybridomas are then cultured either in vitro (e.g., in tissue culture bottles or hollow fiber reactors), or in vivo (as ascites in mice). As an alternative to the use of hybridomas for expression, antibodies can be produced in a cell line such as a CHO or myeloma cell lines, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,403; 5,545,405; and 5,998,144; each incorporated herein by reference. Briefly the cell line is transfected with vectors capable of expressing a light chain and a heavy chain, respectively. By transfecting the two proteins on separate vectors, chimeric antibodies can be produced. Immunol. 147:8; Banchereau et al. (1991) Clin. Immunol. Spectrum 3:8; and Banchereau et al. (1991) Science 251 :70; all of which are herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\n \n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention may be administered to a subject via in vivo therapeutic antibody gene transfer as discussed by Fang et al. (2005), Nat. Biotechnol. 23, 584-590. For example recombinant vectors can be generated to deliver a multicistronic expression cassette comprising a peptide that mediates enzyme independent, cotranslational self cleavage of polypeptides placed between MAb heavy and light chain encoding sequences. Expression leads to stochiometric amounts of both MAb chains. \n\n\n \n\n\nFragments of the antibodies are suitable for use in the methods of the invention so long as they retain the desired affinity of the full-length antibody. Thus, a fragment of an anti-the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 antibody will retain the ability to bind to the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. Such fragments are characterized by properties similar to the corresponding full-length anti-the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 antibody, that is, the fragments will specifically bind a human the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 antigen expressed on the surface of a human cell.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn some embodiments, the antibodies bind to one or more epitopes in the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. In some embodiments, the antibodies modulate biological activities related sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. In some embodiments the antibodies inhibit the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell. \n\n\n \n\n\nMethods of predicting other potential epitopes to which an antibody of the invention can bind are well-known to those of skill in the art and include without limitation, Kyte-Doolittle Analysis (Kyte, J. and Dolittle, R.F., J. MoI. Biol. (1982) 157:105-132), Hopp and Woods Analysis (Hopp, T.P. and Woods, K.R., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1981) 78:3824-3828; Hopp, TJ. and Woods, K.R., MoI. Immunol. (1983) 20:483-489; Hopp, TJ., J. Immunol. Methods (1986) 88:1-18.), Jameson- Wolf Analysis (Jameson, B.A. and Wolf, H., Comput. Appl. Biosci. (1988) 4:181-186.), and Emini Analysis (Emini, E.A., Schlief, W.A., Colonno, RJ. and Wimmer, E., Virology (1985) 140:13-20.).\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibodies are defined to be \"specifically binding\" if: 1) they exhibit a threshold level of binding activity, and/or 2) they do not significantly cross-react with known related polypeptide molecules. The binding affinity of an antibody can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, by Scatchard analysis (Scatchard, Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 51: 660-672, 1949).  \n\n\n \n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, Anti-VCAM-1 mAb was isolated using phage display technology from VCAM-1 specific rabbit/human chimeric antibody library. In order to make a VCAM-1 specific rabbit/human chimeric antibody library, we first immunized rabbits with purified recombinant hVCAM-1. Enzyme immunoassay of rabbit sera collected throughout the immunization courses revealed that all rabbits had elevated antibody titers to the antigen (data not shown). After the fourth booster injection, total RNAs were individually isolated from spleen or bone marrow of the immunized rabbits and subjected to cDNA synthesis. Using three steps of PCR, VCAM-1 specific rabbit/human chimeric Fab library containing rabbit variable regions and human constant regions was generated and cloned into phagemid vector pComb3X, yielding a complexicity of 5.7 x 10\n9\n independent transformants.\n\n\nAfter six rounds of biopanning on immobilized mVCAM-1-Fc using phage display technology, twenty clones were randomly selected, rescued by infection of helper phage, and tested for their reactivity to both hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1 in phage enzyme immunoassay. Selected clone showing strong reactivity to hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1 was subsequently analyzed by DNA sequencing and the nucleotide sequences were converted to amino acid sequences using translator program offered by the JustBio webpage (http://www.justbio.com). \n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-VCAM-1 mAb had strong affinity and broad cross-species relativity to human and mouse VCAM-1. Anti-VCAM-1 mAb specifically recognized the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 - To identify an epitope region for the anti-VCAM-1 mAb, we first generated Fc fusions of wild-type and C-terminal serial deletion mutants of human and mouse VCAM-1 extracellular domains (Fig. 2A). Then, following overexpression in HEK293F and affinity purification with protein A sepharose, the equal amounts of purified Fc fusion proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis for eiptope mapping. Here, anti-human Fc-HRP was used to detect the equal quantity of each Fc fusion proteins. As shown Fig. 2B and 2C, this mAb specifically recognized the sixth IgG-like domain of hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1 respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"oligonucleotide\" refers to a series of linked nucleotide residues. Oligonucleotides include without limitation, antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides comprise portions of a DNA sequence and have at least about 10 nucleotides and as many as about 500 nucleotides. In some embodiments oligonucleotides comprise from about 10 nucleotides to about 50 nucleotides, from about 15 nucleotides to about 30 nucleotides, and from about 20 nucleotides to about 25 nucleotides. Oligonucleotides may be chemically synthesized and can also be used as probes. In some embodiments oligonucleotides are single stranded. In some embodiments oligonucleotides comprise at least one portion which is double stranded. In some embodiments the oligonucleotides are antisense oligonucleotides. In some embodiments the oligonucleotides are RNAi oligonucleotides, siRNAs or shRNAs.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"antisense oligonucleotide\" refers to an unmodified or modified nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence complementary to polynucleotide sequence of a sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1, where the antisense polynucleotide is capable of hybridizing to polynucleotide sequence of a sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. Of particular interest are antisense polynucleotides capable of inhibiting transcription and/or translation of polypeptide f a sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 encoding polynucleotide either in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"siRNA oligonucleotides\", \"RNAi oligonucleotides\", \"short interfering RNA\", or \"siRNA\" are used interchangeably and refer to oligonucleotides that work through post-transcriptional gene silencing, also known as RNA interference (RNAi). The terms refer to a double stranded nucleic acid molecule capable of RNA interference \"RNAi\", (see Kreutzer et al., WO 00/44895; Zernicka-Goetz et al. WO 01/36646; Fire, WO 99/32619; Mello and Fire, WO 01/29058). SiRNA molecules are generally RNA molecules but further encompass chemically modified nucleotides and non-nucleotides. SiRNA gene-targeting experiments have been carried out by transient siRNA transfer into cells (achieved by such classic methods as liposome-mediated transfection, electroporation, or microinjection). Molecules of siRNA are 21- to 23-nucleotide RNAs, with characteristic 2- to 3-nucleotide 3'-overhanging ends resembling the RNase III processing products of long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that normally initiate RNAi. Effective exploitation of the siRNA pathway to mediate gene silencing depends, in part, on efficient methods of intracellular delivery of siRNA. siRNA molecules tend to be short-lived in the cell, not readily deliverable to cell types that are difficult to transfect and relatively expensive to produce via chemical syntheses. (Jacks et al., (2005) Biotechniques 39: 215-224; Bernards et al., (2006) Nature Methods 3: 701-706) One method for efficient intracellular delivery of siRNA is the use of short hairpin RNAs, or \"shRNAs\". shRNAs are single stranded RNA molecules that include two complementary sequences joined by a non-complementary region. In vivo, the complementary sequences anneal to create a double-stranded helix with an unpaired loop at one end. The resulting lollypop-shaped shaped structure is called a stem loop and can be recognized by the RNAi machinery and processed intracellularly into short duplex RNAs having siRNA-like properties.\n\n\n \n\n\nshRNA can be synthesized in a cell by transcription from a DNA template that has been inserted into a appropriate vector. Useful shRNAs are typically 50-70 nucleotides in length, with two complementary sequences of 19-29 nucleotides separated by a 5-10 nucleotide loop. shRNA construction is generally effected by one of three methods: annealing of complementary oligonucleotides; promoter-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR); or primer extension. Many vector systems employ RNA Pol IH promoters; Pol Ill- mediated transcription is advantageous because it initiates at a well-defined start-site, produces a non-poly (A) containing transcript and Pol in promoters are active in all cell types. (Brummelkamp et al., (2002) Science 296: 550-553; Mclntyre, G. and Fanning, G. (2006) BMC Biotechnology 6: 1-8)\n\n\n \n\n\nshRNA-encoding vector systems provide a renewable intracellular source of gene-silencing reagents that can mediate persistent gene silencing after stable integration of the vector into the host genome. Moreover, the shRNA cassette can be readily inserted into retroviral, lentiviral or adenoviral vectors to facility delivery of shRNA into a broad range of cell types, -including nondividing primary cultures. Regulatable versions of shRNA vectors are particularly useful for genetic screens.\n\n\n \n\n\nPreferably, it is also possible to inhibit activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 in combination with the modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1.\n \nAs used herein, the terms \"in combination with\" or \"in conjunction with\" refer to administration of the modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 with other therapeutic regimens.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe present invention further provides methods of inhibiting VCAM-1 mediated-diseases in a patient diagnosed or suspected of having a VCAM-1 mediated-diseases. More particularly, the present invention provides a method of preventing or treating VCAM-1 mediated-disease by inhibiting activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1. The methods may comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 to the patient. The present invention also provides methods for inhibiting the transmigration of leukocyte across activated endothelial cell in a patient comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a modulator of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 to said patient. Suitable assays for measuring transmigration of leukocyte across activated endothelial cell are known to those skilled in the art and are set forth supra and infra.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe methods comprise determining if the patient is a candidate for therapy of  VCAM-1 mediated-diseases and administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 to the patient if the patient is a candidate for therapy of VCAM-1 mediated-diseases.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe terms \"patient\" or \"subject\" are used interchangeably and refer to any subject for whom diagnosis, treatment, or therapy is desired, particularly humans. Other subjects may include cattle, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, horses, and the like. In some preferred embodiments the subject is a human.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe present invention further provides methods including other active ingredients in combination with the modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 of the present invention. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise administering one or more conventional VCAM-1 mediated-diseases therapeutics to the patient. In some embodiments the methods of the present invention further comprise treating the patient with one or more of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery. The present invention also provides methods and compositions for the treatment, inhibition, and management of VCAM-1 mediated-diseases or disease that has become partially or completely refractory to current or standard VCAM-1 mediated-diseases treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, and biological therapy. \n\n\n \n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount of the modulating compound can be determined empirically, according to procedures well known to medicinal chemists, and will depend, inter alia, on the age of the patient, severity of the condition, and on the ultimate pharmaceutical formulation desired. Administration of the modulators of the present invention can be carried out, for example, by inhalation or suppository or to mucosal tissue such as by lavage to vaginal, rectal, urethral, buccal and sublingual tissue, orally, topically, intranasally, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intravenously, intralymphatically, intratumorly, intramuscularly, interstitially, intra-arterially, subcutaneously, intraoccularly, intrasynovial, transepithelial, and transdermally. In some embodiments, the inhibitors are administered by lavage, orally or inter-arterially. Other suitable methods of introduction can also include rechargeable or biodegradable devices and slow or sustained release polymeric devices. As discussed above, the therapeutic compositions of this invention can also be administered as part of a combinatorial therapy with other known anti-VCAM-1 mediated-diseases agents or other known anti-bone disease treatment regimen.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing VCAM-1 mediated-diseases or symptoms of VCAM-1 mediated-diseases in a subject. \n\n\nPrevention or treatment of VCAM-1 mediated disease can be accomplished by inhibiting activity of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 to an effective extent of inhibiting the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell, and more preferably, it is not associated with the binding of leukocyte to endothelial cell. For preventing or treating VCAM-1 mediated disease, one or more modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 in a therapeutically effective amount can be administered to a patient. And, modulators of the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of VCAM-1 can be administered to a patient using a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also, the method of treating VCAM-1 mediated disease described in this invention can be administered in combination or alternation with a second biologically active agent to increase its effectiveness against the target disorder.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent, such as antibodies or a polypeptide, genes, and other therapeutic agents. The term refers to any pharmaceutical carrier that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which can be administered without undue toxicity. Suitable carriers can be large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, lipid aggregates and inactive virus particles.

These mice were housed in the Laboratory Animal Research Center at the Samsung Medical Center following Committee Guidelines. The C57BL/6j mice were divided into two groups:1) The control group (CG) underwent Lp. injection of PBS 88.6ul x2 times per day for 10 days(from 0 days post transplantation to 9 days post transplantation). 2) The experimental group (EG) underwent Lp. injection of anti VCAM-1 Fab 1.25mg prepared in PBS 88.6ul x2 times per day for 10 days(from odays post transplantation to 9 days post transplantation).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInduction of diabetes mellitus of mice and monitering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC57BL/6j mices(10 weeks age old) were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal administration of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) freshly dissolved in citrate buffer, and they were transplanted 3 days after STZ administration, only after two consecutive non-fasting blood glucose readings of >250 mg/dl were obtained from whole blood. In detail, diabetes was confirmed by the presence of hyperglycemia, weight loss, and polyuria. Only those mice with non-fasting blood glucose level between 400 mg/dl and 450 mg/dl were used as recipients. Blood glucose was measured on \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and weekly until \ndays\n 25 after transplantation. Blood glucose, determined between 9:00 and 11 :00 A.M. in non-fasting conditions, was obtained from the snipped tail, and measured by a portable glucose meter (L1FESCAN INC., Milpitas, CA).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation of islets of Langerhans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine islets were isolated as described previously [Lacy, 1967 #29]. Briefly, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and the pancreas was exposed and injected with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 0.55 mg/ml collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) via the common bile duct until distension was achieved. Digestion was performed at 37℃ for 17 min with gentle shaking and terminated by the addition of cold RPMI-10% FCS and 2 mmol/l L-glutamine (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY). Mechanical disruption of the pancreas was achieved by passages through a metal mesh, and islets were purified on Euro-Ficoll (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) gradients by centrifugation at 900g for 11 min, routinely yielding preparations of >90% purity. Islets were hand-picked, counted and scored for\n\n\nsize. An algorithm was used for the calculation of a 150-lJm-diameter islet equivalent number (IE). Islets were stabilized by culturing in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 11 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FCS, 100 Ulml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (complete medium) for 2 hrs before the experiments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIslet transplantation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree-hundreds IE(lslet Equivalents) of Balb/c male mice were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of C57BL/6j male mice made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) freshly dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5). 300 IE has been chosen as it has been known as our previous unpublished data.

To confirm whether our anti VCAM-1 Fab could inhibit VCAM-1-mediated downstream signaling pathway, we pre-treated HUVEC stimulated with hTNFa with anti-VCAM-1 Fab followed by VCAM-1 cross-linking.\n\n\nThen, to check the effect of the antibody on rac1 activation, we incubated the cell extracts with GST or GST-PBD and then subjected to immunoblot anlaysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, we found that our anti-VCAM-1 Fab specifically inhibits the Rac1 activation induced by VCAM-1 cross-linking on HUVEC. To further examine whether this antibody could block ROS generation produced by VCAM-1 activation, after the VCAM-1 cross-linking in the presence of DCF-DA, the changes of fluorescence were measured using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6B, the antibody was found to inhibit ROS generation after VCAM-1 cross-linking on HUVEC. To further check the effect of the antibody on p38 MAPK activation, we monitored the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK after VCAM-1 cross-linking in the absence or presence of anti-VCAM-1 Fab. As shown in Fig. 6C, we found that this antibody could also inhibit p38 MAPK induced by VCAM-1 cross-linking on HUVEC.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsignificantly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nalleviates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIBMIR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n a \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nislet allograft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to investigate \nin\n\n\n \n\n\nvivo\n\n\n \nefficacy of anti-VCAM-1 Fab, we first set mouse islet allograft models. In detail, 300 IEQ of BALB/c male mice (H-2d) was engrafted under the beneath of left kidney capsule in C57BL/6j (H-2b) male recipient mice rendered diabetes Mellitus by Streptozotocin. Then, we treated the buffer (negative control; blue line) or purified anti-VCAM-1 Fab (red line) via daily twice intraperitoneal (i.p) injection at mouse islet allograft models up to 10 days. As shown in Fig. 7, we found that the graft of 300 lEO of BALB/c male mice (H-2d) could control blood glucose level of C57BL/6j (H-2b) male recipient mice in EG, in contrast that the same graft could not control blood glucose level of C57BL/6j (H-2b) male recipient mice in CG. The blood glucose level was maintained lower than 250 mg/dl in EG within the 7 days post islet transplantation when Immediate blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) processes and islet can be lost due to IBMIR. In contrast, the blood glucose level was higher than mg/dl in EG within the 7 days post islet transplantation when Immediate blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IB-MIR) processes and islet can be lost due to IB-MIR. Since 7 days post transplantation, the blood glucose level of EG became to be perfect normal until 25 days post transplantation. The blood glucose level of EG became to be abnormal, higher than 250 mg/dl actually.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe inventors of the present invention tested more deeply to find out the specific domain combined with the VCAM-1 antibody among domains of VCAM-1 so as to show the aforementioned effect, and hereafter it will be described. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5, 6-carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), Alexa Fluor-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, rhodamine phalloidin, and Hoechst were obtained from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Paraformaldehyde, MPL+TDM+CWS adjuvant, methothrexate, and poly-L-lysine were from Sigma. Human and mouse TNFα (hTNFα) and Labscale TFF System were from Millipore (Bedford, MA, USA). HUVEC, HAEC, and endothelial growth media-2 (EGM-2) bullet kits were from Lonza (Baltimore, MD, USA). Penicillin/streptomycin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), RPMI 1640, \nFreestyle\n \n \n \nTM \n293 expression media, CD OptiCHO\nTM\n complete medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) were purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Recombinant human SDF-1α , human VCAM-1 (hVCAM-1), and Fc chimeras of human and mouse VCAM-1 (mVCAM-1) were from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell culture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector- or hVCAM-1-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293F was in \nFreestyle\n \n \n \nTM\n 293 expression media supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. HUVEC and HAEC were maintained in EGM-2 followed by manufacturer’s instruction. Mouse vascular endothelial cell (MVEC) lines kindly donated by Dr. Saito (Tsurumi University, Tsurumi, Japan) were in Medium 199 supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 10 ㎍/ml insulin, 2.4 ㎍/ml hydrocortisone, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. U937 human monocytic cell lines were in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293F and the other cells were cultured at 37 ℃ in a humidified CO2-controlled (8% or 5%) incubator respectively. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of antibody library and selection of binders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protocol was performed as described previously (5). In brief, recombinant hVCAM-1 was injected to two different groups of two New Zealand white rabbits under approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Seoul National University Hospital. After final booster injection, total RNA was prepared from the spleen and the bone marrow and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript\nTM\n First-Strand (Invitrogen, USA). Following the construction of a rabbit/human chimeric Fab library, Fab clones were selected from the library, through a total of six rounds of biopanning on 2.5 ㎍ of mVCAM-1-Fc coated-Dynabeads M-270 epoxy (Invitrogen, USA) using phage display technology as described (14). After the last round of panning, phage were produced from single clones grown on output plates and tested for binding to human and mouse VCAM-1-Fc by phage enzyme immunoassay as described (15).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of anti-VCAM-1 Fab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHB2151 E.coli transformed with phagemid DNA was grown in LB medium containing 50 ㎍/ml carbenicillin. The supernatants collected from E.coli were concentrated to approximately 10 times with Labscale TFF System and then incubated with anti-HA antibody-protein A Sepharose complex. After several washings with ImmunoPure(G) IgG binding buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Rockford, IL), the bound proteins were eluted with ImmunoPure IgG elution buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Rockford, IL) and the fraction was immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris, pH 9.2 to adjust physiological pH. The purity of the proteins was evaluated with Coomassie Brilliant staining. In this study, anti-VCAM-1 Fab provided by Hanwha Petroleum Company was partly used.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter pre-incubation of the indicated amounts of antigens overnight at 4 ℃, a microtiter plate was blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS, incubated with the 10 ㎍/ml of irrelevant Fab and anti-VCAM-1 Fab for 1 hr at 37 ℃, and washed two times with PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. The extent of antibody bound to the antigens was detected by the application of HRP-conjugated anti-human Fab specific antibody. Optical density was measured at 450 nm by a microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Barcelona, Spain) after incubation with ultra TMB substrate solution (GenDEPOT, Barker, TX).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunoblot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (16). Briefly, after measuring protein concentration using the Bradford assay, denatured proteins in a Laemmli sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting using the wet transfer system (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in TTBS buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder, the membranes were incubated with anti-human Fc-HRP (1:5,000) or 10 ㎍/ml of anti-VCAM-1 Fab, which was followed by another incubation with anti-human Fab-HRP (1:1,000). Detection was performed using a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow cytometry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow cytometry was performed as described previously (5). Briefly, the endothelial cells cultured in the absence or presence of indicated stimuli for 1 day were harvested and incubated with 10 ㎍/ml of anti-VCAM-1 Fab in blocking buffer containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide in PBS at 37 ℃ for 1 hr. After three times washings with blocking buffer, the cells were then incubated with FITC-labeled anti-human Fab antibody (1:100) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory Inc, Baltimore, PA) at 37 ℃ for 1 hr. After several washings with PBS, the final pellets were subjected to flow cytometry (Beckmann Coulter, Miami, FL).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-time interaction analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kinetic parameters of the interaction among the anti-VCAM-1 Fab, anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG, and VCAM-1 were determined using the BIAcore system X-100 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, human and mouse VCAM-1-Fc were immobilized on a CM5 dextran sensor chip (Biacore AB) in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 5 ㎕/min using the amine coupling kit. Anti-VCAM-1 Fab and IgG in HEPES- buffered saline containing 0.005% surfactant P20, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl were injected over 2 min 30 sec at a flow rate of 30 ㎕/min at 37 ℃ and the surface was regenerated with 1 M NaCl/50 mM NaOH. Biacore X-100 evaluation software version 1.1 was used to fit the data and calculate KD values for the binding of the antibody to antigens.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wild-type (WT) and C-terminal serial domain deletion mutants (hVCAM-1-C1~C5, mVCAM-1-C1~C2) of hVCAM-1 or mVCAM-1 extracellular domain depicted in Fig. 2A were generated by PCR with synthetic primers. The PCR products of wild-type and the serial deletion mutants were digested with Sfi I and then ligated with modified pcDNA 3.1 vectors (Invitrogen, USA), which contains the hinge region and CH2-CH3 domain of human IgG1 and finally produces the Fc fusion protein. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Then, 50 ㎍ of individual DNAs were transfected to 4 x 10\n7\n of HEK293F cell lines respectively using 50 ㎍ of polyethylenimine (Polyscience, Warrington, PA). After one week, the culture media were harvested and purified using affinity chromatography with protein A sepharose overnight at 4℃. Following several two times washings with PBS, the final pellets in sample buffer were boiled at 95℃ for 5 min and subjected to immunoblot analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransendothelial cell migration assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 x 10\n5\n of HUVEC was added to transwell polycarbonate membranes with 3 ?m pores (Corning Inc, Coring, NY) overnight at 37℃, followed by treating the cells with 20 ng/ml of hTNFα. After 1 day incubation, U937 (2x10\n5\n cells/well) human monocytic cell lines were placed in the upper chamber. Simultaneously, about 1 ml of RPMI1640 medium containing 25 ng/ml of human SDF-1α was placed in the lower chamber. After 1 day of incubation, the migrated cells in the lower chamber were collected and counted under a light microscope. To investigate the inhibitory effect of anti-VCAM-1 Fab on leukocyte transmigration, 50 or 100 ㎍/ml of anti-VCAM-1 Fab was treated to the inserts in prior to adding U937 cells for 1 hr at 37 ℃.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of \nHEK\n 293 cell line stably overexpressing the full-length of hVCAM-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full-length cDNA of hVCAM-1 was ligated into the KpnI or XhoI site of pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). 5 x 10\n4\n of HEK293 cell lines was transfected with 4 ㎍ of the expression vector encoding the full-length of hVCAM-1 with 6 ㎕ of TurboFect\nTM\n (Fermentas International, Inc., Burlington, Canada) as manufacturer’s recommendation. Then, after 1 day, the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 400 mg/ml of G418 as a selection marker for more than 1 month to select HEK293 cell line stably expressing the full-length of hVCAM-1. The expression of hVCAM-1 on the selected clones were confirmed by flow cytometry.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell adhesion and neutralization assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeukocyte adhesion assays were performed with minor modification as described (17). Briefly, 3 x 10\n5\n cells of vector-transfected (MOCK) or hVCAM-1 overexpressing HEK293 cell lines, HAEC, and HUVEC were plated on 6 well dishes. Human endothelial cells were then stimulated by hTNFα for 1 day. Following CFSE labeling with U937 cells, the labeled cells were incubated with activated endothelial cells or the HEK293 cell lines for 1 hr at 37℃ and then unbound cells were washed 5 times with 1x PBS containing 0.2 mM CaCl\n2\n and 0.1 mM MgCl\n2\n. The final cells were trypsinized and then subjected to flow cytometry. For neutralizing assay, the activated endothelial cells or the HEK293 cell lines were incubated in the absence or presence of 50 ㎍/ml of anti-VCAM-1 Fab for 1 hr at 37℃ in prior to the addition of CFSE labeled U937 cells. Following procedures are the same to above procedures.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of anti-VCAM full-IgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHO-DG44 cell lines () were transfected with a vector encoding anti-VCAM-1 Full-IgG using electroporation with MicroPulser\nTM\n electroporator (Bio-Rad, USA). After 2 days, \n5x\n 10\n2\n of the cells were transferred to 96 well plates and cultured in CD OptiCHO\nTM\n complete medium supplemented with 200 mM L-glutamine, 500 mg/ml G418 (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY), and 25 nM methothrexate for 19 day. Then, the culture media were subjected to ELISA to select strong clone to express antibody having dual cross species reactivity to hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1. Through several rounds of selection procedures, the final clones were grown in 1L of VWR Polycarbonate erlenmeyer flask containing CD OptiCHO\nTM\n complete medium supplemented with 500 mg/ml G418 and 200 mM L-glutamine at 37C in a shaking incubator (Infors HT Mini-tron, Bottmingen, Switzerland). Following centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 30min, the supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography with protein A Sepharose column.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation of mouse pancreatic islets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine islets were isolated as described previously (18). Briefly, the mouse pancreas harvested from Balb/c male mice (10 weeks age old, H-2d: donor) (Charles liver Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) was exposed and injected using Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS; Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 0.8 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) via the common bile duct until distension was achieved. The distended pancreas was digested at 37℃ for 12 min with gentle shaking and terminated by the addition of cold RPMI-10% FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY). The islets achieved by passages through a metal mesh were purified on Euro-Ficoll (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) gradients by centrifugation at 900 x g for 11 min, routinely yielding preparations of >90% purity. Islets were stabilized by culturing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 11 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (complete medium) for 2 hrs before the experiments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment of mouse islet allograft model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n250 Islet Equivalents (IEQ) of Balb/c male mice were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of C57BL/6j male mice (10 weeks age old, H-2b: recipient) made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection (i.p) of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) freshly dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5). The C57BL/6j mice were divided into two groups: 1) the control group was treated with 100 ㎕ of PBS via i.p. injection per day for 8 days (from 0 days post transplantation to 7 days post transplantation). 2) The experimental group was treated with of 100 ㎍ of anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG in \nPBS\n 100 ㎕ via i.p. injection per day for 7 days (from 0 days post transplantation to 7 days post transplantation).

Enzyme immunoassay of rabbit sera collected throughout the immunization courses revealed that all rabbits had elevated antibody titers to the antigen (data not shown). After the fourth booster injection, total RNAs were individually isolated from spleen or bone marrow of the immunized rabbits and subjected to cDNA synthesis. Using three steps of PCR, VCAM-1 specific rabbit/human chimeric Fab library containing rabbit variable regions and human constant regions was generated and cloned into phagemid vector pComb3X, yielding a complexicity of 5.7 x 10\n9\n independent transformants.\n\n\nAfter six rounds of biopanning on immobilized mVCAM-1-Fc using phage display technology, twenty clones were randomly selected, rescued by infection of helper phage, and tested for their reactivity to both hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1 in phage enzyme immunoassay. Selected clone showing strong reactivity to hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1 was subsequently analyzed by DNA sequencing and the nucleotide sequences were converted to amino acid sequences using translator program offered by the JustBio webpage (http://www.justbio.com). \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\naffinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nbroad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelativity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n human \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Following overexpression in \nE. \n\n\nColi\n and purification by anti-HA affinity column chromatography, a 0.3 mg of anti-VCAM-1 Fab was finally obtained from 1 L of a shaking culture. The purity of the antibody was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (data not shown). Next, using ELISA (Fig. 1A) and western blotting (Fig. 1B), we first tested the reactivity of the antibody to recombinant hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1. The results indicated that anti-VCAM-1 mAb had cross-species reactivity to hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1. Furthermore, the kinetic rate constants parameters for interaction between the mAb and VCAM-1 were determined using BIAcore biosensor analysis (Table. 1). The result showed that anti-VCAM-1 mAb has \nK\n\n\n \nD\n \n=1.35±0.02x10\n-8\n of hVCAM-1 and \nK\n\n\n \nD\n \n=4.78±0.06x10\n-10\n of mVCAM-1 respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nTable 1 \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn order to verify the reactivity of the antibody to native VCAM-1, HAECs, HUVECs, and MVECs cultured in the absence or presence of hTNFa or mTNFa were subjected to flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). The result also shows that this mAb could recognize native VCAM-1 expressing on activated human and mouse endothelial cells. \n\n\nIn summary, these findings provide clear evidences that this mAb has strong affinity and broad cross-species reactivity to both hVCAM-1 and mVCAM-1.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecifically\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecognized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsixth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTo identify an epitope region for the anti-VCAM-1 mAb, we first generated Fc fusions of wild-type and C-terminal serial deletion mutants of human and mouse VCAM-1 extracellular domains (Fig. 2A). Then, following overexpression in HEK293F and affinity purification with protein A sepharose, the equal amounts of purified Fc fusion proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis for eiptope mapping. Here, anti-human Fc-HRP was used to detect the equal quantity of each Fc fusion proteins.

Then, transendothelial cell migration assay was performed with U937 human monocytic cell lines in the absence or presence of anti-VCAM-1 Fab. As shown in Fig. 3, we found that anti-VCAM-1 mAb could significantly inhibit the transmigration of U937 cells across activated HUVECs.\n\n\nTo further verify the role of the sixth IgG-like domain on VCAM-1-a4b1 interaction, we first generated vector- or hVCAM-1-\noverexpressing HEK\n 293 cell lines (Fig. 4A). Then, we performed neutralizing assay with those HEK293 cell lines, HAEC, and HUVEC and CSFE-labeled U937 in the absence or presence of anti-VCAM-1 mAb. As shown in Fig. 4B-4C, we found that this mAb little affect the VCAM-1-mediated binding of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells.\n\n\nIn summary, these results indicated that the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 is important for transmigration of U937 cells across activated HUVECs, regardless of interaction between a4b1 integrin and VCAM-1.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsixth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVCAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncould\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n a \n\n\n\n\n\n\nnew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntarget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n alleviating \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nallogeneic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransplantation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrejection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to investigate the role of the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 \nin\n\n\n \n\n\nvivo\n, we first overproduced anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG from CHO-DG44 stably overexpressing anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG. Here, we confirmed that anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG has the same epitope and cross-species reactivity with anti-VCAM-1 Fab (data not shown). Then, we also established mouse islet allograft models. In detail, 250 IEQ of donor BALB/c male mice (H-2\nd\n) was engrafted under the beneath of left kidney capsule in C57BL/6j (H-2\nb\n) male recipient mice rendered Diabetes Mellitus by Streptozotocin. Then, we treated C57BL/6j (H-2\nb\n) recipient mice with buffer (negative control) or purified anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG daily via intraperitoneal injection up to 7 days (Fig. 5A) and monitored blood glucose level every day until 31 days (Fig. 5B). The result showed that in anti-VCAM-1 full-IgG-treated groups, the blood glucose level has been kept to be perfectly normal, lower than 250 mg/dl, until 31 days post transplantation, but in buffer-treated groups, the blood glucose level gradually became to be abnormal, higher than 250 mg/dl. \n\n\nIn summary, the result shows that the sixth IgG-like domain of VCAM-1 may be a new molecular target for alleviating mouse allogeneic transplantation rejection\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the present invention, it is expected that it will be possible not only to screen materials that can inhibit the transmigration of leukocyte across endothelial cell without affecting the binding of leukocyte to endothelial cell, but also to effectively prevent or treat VCAM-1 mediated-diseases."

Description\n\n\n\n\n Preventing and Treating Sepsis\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/110,867, filed November 3, 2008, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH\n\n\nThis invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. HL087088, HL18208, HL68571, GM065085 and GM066194 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nMigration of leukocytes to infection sites is vital for pathogen clearance and, thus, for host survival. Interaction of cell surface integrins with their counterpart ligands, which are expressed on the endothelial surface, results in the localization and adherence of circulating neutrophils to endothelial cells. This is followed by neutrophil activation and directed migration to sites of infection through the extracellular matrix. An important function of integrins is to concentrate neutrophils at the infection site, ensuring that their immune products and activities remain at this site, while minimizing unnecessary injury to uninfected tissues. Sustained or dysregulated integrin activation, resulting in abnormal neutrophil trafficking, as well as direct damage to the vasculature and the underlying tissue, is known to contribute to sepsis. Recombinat human activated protein C (rhAPC) is the only FDA-approved drug for treating severe sepsis. APC is a vitamin-K dependent serine protease that is derived from protein C (PC) and is well known for its anticoagulant functions.\n\n\nSUMMARY Provided are polypeptides comprising a variant activated protein C.\n\n\nSpecifically, provided are polypeptides comprising an activated protein C (APC) polypeptide comprising one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of K146R, D172N, C212R, K146G, R147G, R177G and combinations thereof. Also provided are nucleic acids encoding the polypeptides, and cells, compositions and kits containing the polypeptides and nucleic acids. \n\n Provided are methods of treating sepsis in a subject comprising administering to the subject a variant activated protein C. The variant includes one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of K146R, D172N, C212R, K146G, R147G, R177G and combinations thereof. Methods of screening for polypeptides with enhanced activated protein C activity are provided. For example, the methods include contacting a polypeptide to be tested with a cell expressing one or both of βl integrin and β3 integrin, wherein the polypeptide to be tested comprises activated protein C or a fragment thereof comprising one or more amino acid substitutions, and determining whether the polypeptide to be tested binds to the βl integrin or β3 integrin better than a control activated protein C or fragment thereof. Binding better than the control indicates the polypeptide to be tested has enhanced activated protein C activity.\n\n\nAlso provided are methods of screening for an agent for the treatment of sepsis. The method includes contacting the agent to be screened with a cell expressing one or both of βl integrin and β3 integrin, contacting an activated protein C or fragment thereof with the cell, and determining whether the agent competes with APC for binding to the βl integrin or β3 integrin. If the agent competes with APC for binding, this indicates the agent is suitable for the treatment of sepsis.\n\n\nFurther provided is a method of treating sepsis in a subject comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more RGD-containing peptides.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\nFigures IA- IE show recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) inhibits neutrophil migration.

Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) has been shown to protect patients with severe sepsis, although this protective effect remains unclear. As described herein, rhAPC was demonstrated to directly bind to βl and β3 integrins and to inhibit neutrophil migration, both in vitro and in vivo. It was found that human APC possesses an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, which is critical for the inhibition. Mutation of this sequence abolished both integrin binding and inhibition of neutrophil migration. In addition, an RGD peptide enhanced the survival of septic mice. Thus, leukocyte integrins are cellular receptors for rhAPC, and their interaction decreases neutrophil recruitment into tissues, providing a mechanism by which rhAPC protects from sepsis.\n\n\nProvided herein are variant APC polypeptides and variant APC polypeptide fragments. Such variants contain a RGD motif and are selected for their ability to bind integrins, such as βl and/or β3 integrins. Optionally, the variant APC polypeptides bind with higher affinity to the integrins than wild-type APC. Specifically, provided are APC polypeptides comprising one or more amino acid substitutions. There are a variety of sequences that are disclosed on Genbank, at www.pubmed.gov and these sequences are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties as are individual subsequences or fragments contained therein. For example, the amino acid sequence of human protein C can be found at GenBank Accession No. NP 000303.1 and P04070. Human protein C (SEQ ID NO:2) is synthesized as a single chain precursor, which is cleaved into a light chain and a heavy chain held together by a disulfide bond. Activated protein C is shown as SEQ ID NO: 1. Thus, provided are polypeptides of an APC comprising one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of K146R, D172N, C212R, K146G, R147G, R177G and combinations thereof. Optionally, the APC comprises the amino acid substitution K146R or D172N. Optionally, the APC comprises the amino acid substitutions K146G and R147G. Optionally, the APC comprises the amino acid substitutions R177G, K146G and R147G. Optionally, the APC comprises the amino acid substitutions C212R, K146G and R147G. Optionally, the APC comprises the amino acid substitutions C212R and R177G. Optionally, the APC \n\n further comprises the amino acid substitutions KKK191-193AAA and/or RR229/230AA.\n\n\nOptionally, the APC comprises SEQ ID NO:1. Thus, provided are polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:1 with one or more amino acid substitutions. The amino acid substitutions include K146R, D172N, C212R, K146G, R147G, R177G and combinations thereof. Optionally, the polypeptides further include amino acid substitutions RR229/230AA and/or KKK191-193AA. Thus, provided are polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs:3-32, 42 and 43.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms peptide, polypeptide, protein or peptide portion are used broadly herein to mean two or more amino acids linked by a peptide bond. The term fragment is used herein to refer to a portion of a full-length polypeptide or protein. It should be recognized that the term polypeptide is not used herein to suggest a particular size or number of amino acids comprising the molecule and that a peptide of the invention can contain up to several amino acid residues or more. A polypeptide comprising a fragment of the variant APC polypeptides are provided. Thus, provided are fragments of SEQ ID NO: 1 comprising one or more amino acid substitutions. Thus, the fragments include one or more of the amino acid substitutions selected from K146R, D172N, C212R, K146G, R147G, R177G and combinations thereof. Optionally, the fragments further include amino acid substitutions RR229/230AA and/or BCKKl 91-193AA. The fragments also include an RGD motif. It is understood that the term fragment includes a functional fragment. A functional fragment of a variant APC is selected for its ability to bind integrins, such as βl and/or β3 integrins, for example, as shown in the Examples.\n\n\nAs discussed above, the polypeptides provided herein, including fragments, have a desired function. The polypeptides as described herein selectively bind βl and/or β3 integrins. By binding is meant a detectable binding of at least about 1.5 times the background of the assay method. For selective or specific binding such a detectable binding can be detected for a given agent but not a control antigen or agent. Optionally, the polypeptides described herein bind with similar or higher affinity than wild-type APC (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1). By binding with higher affinity is meant a detectable binding at least about 1.5 times higher than the binding affinity of a control (e.g., wild type) for a particular assay method. The polypeptides are tested for their desired activity using the in vitro assays described herein, or by analogous methods, \n\n after which their therapeutic, diagnostic or other purification activities are tested according to known testing methods.\n\n\nAs with all peptides, polypeptides, and proteins, including fragments thereof, it is understood that additional modifications in the amino acid sequence of the variant APC polypeptides can occur that do not alter the nature or function of the peptides, polypeptides, or proteins. Such modifications include conservative amino acid substitutions and are discussed in greater detail below.\n\n\nThe polypeptides described herein can be further modified so long as the desired function is maintained. It is understood that one way to define any known modifications and derivatives or those that might arise, of the disclosed genes and proteins herein is through defining the modifications and derivatives in terms of identity to specific known sequences. Specifically disclosed are polypeptides which have at least, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 percent identity to the APC and APC variants provided herein. For example, provided are polypeptides which have at least, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 percent identity to one of SEQ ID NOs:3-32. Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the identity of two polypeptides. For example, the identity can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the identity is at its highest level.\n\n\nAnother way of calculating identity can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482 (1981), by the identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. MoL Biol. 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by inspection. The same types of identity can be obtained for nucleic acids by, for example, the algorithms disclosed in Zuker, M. Science 244:48-52, 1989, Jaeger et al. Proc.\n\n\nNatl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:7706-7710, 1989, Jaeger et al. Methods Enzymol. 183:281- 306, 1989, which are herein incorporated by reference for at least material related to nucleic acid alignment. It is understood that any of the methods typically can be used \n\n and that in certain instances the results of these various methods may differ, but the skilled artisan understands if identity is found with at least one of these methods, the sequences would be said to have the stated identity, and be disclosed herein.\n\n\nProtein modifications include amino acid sequence modifications. Modifications in amino acid sequence may arise naturally as allelic variations (e.g., due to genetic polymorphism) or may be produced by human intervention (e.g., by mutagenesis of cloned DNA sequences), such as induced point, deletion, insertion and substitution mutants. These modifications can result in changes in the amino acid sequence, provide silent mutations, modify a restriction site, or provide other specific mutations. Post-translational modifications can include variations in the type or amount of carbohydrate moieties of the protein core or any fragment or derivative thereof. Amino acid sequence modifications typically fall into one or more of three classes: substitutional, insertional or deletional modifications. Insertions include amino and/or carboxyl terminal fusions as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Insertions ordinarily will be smaller insertions than those of amino or carboxyl terminal fusions, for example, on the order of one to four residues. Deletions are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acid residues from the protein sequence. Typically, no more than about from 2 to 6 residues are deleted at any one site within the protein molecule. Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues, but can occur at a number of different locations at once; insertions usually will be on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues; and deletions will range about from 1 to 30 residues. Deletions or insertions preferably are made in adjacent pairs, i.e. a deletion of 2 residues or insertion of 2 residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof may be combined to arrive at a final construct. The mutations must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mRNA structure. Substitutional modifications are those in which at least one residue has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Such substitutions generally are made in accordance with the following Table 1 and are referred to as conservative substitutions. \n\n TABLE 1 :Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\nAmino Acid Substitutions (others are known in the art)\n\n\nAla Ser, GIy, Cys\n\n\nArg Lys, GIn, Met, He\n\n\nAsn GIn, His, GIu, Asp\n\n\nAsp GIu, Asn, GIn\n\n\nCys Ser, Met, Thr\n\n\nGIn Asn, Lys, GIu, Asp\n\n\nGIu Asp, Asn, GIn\n\n\nGIy Pro, Ala\n\n\nHis Asn, GIn\n\n\nHe Leu, VaI, Met\n\n\nLeu He, VaI, Met\n\n\nLys Arg, GIn, Met, He\n\n\nMet Leu, He, VaI\n\n\nPhe Met, Leu, Tyr, Trp, His\n\n\nSer Thr, Met, Cys\n\n\nThr Ser, Met, VaI\n\n\nTrp Tyr, Phe\n\n\nTyr Trp, Phe, His\n\n\nVaI He, Leu, Met\n\n\nModifications, including the specific amino acid substitutions, are made by known methods including the methods described in the Examples below. By way of example, modifications are made by site specific mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding the protein, thereby producing DNA encoding the modification, and thereafter expressing the DNA in recombinant cell culture. Techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known, for example M 13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Nucleic acids that encode the aforementioned variant polypeptide sequences and fragments thereof are also disclosed. Thus, provided is a nucleic acid sequence encoding an APC comprising one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of K146R, D172N, C212R, K146G, R147G, R177G and \n\n combinations thereof Optionally, the encoded APC comprises the amino acid substitutions K146R or D172N. Optionally, the encoded APC comprises the amino acid substitutions K146G and R147G. Optionally, the encoded APC comprises the amino acid substitutions R177G, K146G and R147G. Optionally, the encoded APC comprises the amino acid substitutions C212R, K146G and R147G. Optionally, the encoded APC comprises the amino acid substitutions C212R and R177G. Optionally, the encoded APC comprises an RGD motif. Optionally, the encoded APC further comprises the amino acid substitutions KKK191-193AAA and/or RR229/230AA. Thus, provided are nucleic acids encoding SEQ ID NOs: 1-32, 42 and 43. These nucleic acid sequences include all degenerate sequences related to a specific protein sequence, i.e. all nucleic acids having a sequence that encodes one particular protein sequence as well as all nucleic acids, including degenerate nucleic acids, encoding the disclosed variants and derivatives of the protein sequences. Thus, while each particular nucleic acid sequence may not be written out herein, it is understood that each and every sequence is in fact disclosed and described herein through the disclosed protein sequence.\n\n\nIsolated nucleic acid molecules can be produced by standard techniques. For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can be used to obtain an isolated nucleic acid containing a nucleotide sequence described herein. Various PCR methods are described, for example, in PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual,\n\n\nDieffenbach and Dveksler, eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995. Various PCR strategies also are available by which the site-specific nucleotide sequence modifications described herein can be introduced into a template nucleic acid. Optionally, isolated nucleic acids are chemically synthesized, either as a single nucleic acid molecule (e.g., using automated DNA synthesis in the 3' to 5' direction using phosphoramidite technology) or as a series of oligonucleotides. For example, one or more pairs of long oligonucleotides (e.g., >100 nucleotides) can be synthesized that contain the desired sequence, with each pair containing a short segment of complementarity (e.g., about 15 nucleotides) such that a duplex is formed when the oligonucleotide pair is annealed. DNA polymerase is used to extend the oligonucleotides, resulting in a single, double-stranded nucleic acid molecule per oligonucleotide pair, which then can be ligated into a vector. Isolated nucleic acids \n\n disclosed herein also can be obtained by mutagenesis of, e.g., a naturally occurring DNA.\n\n\nAlso provided are expression vectors comprising the disclosed nucleic acids, wherein the nucleic acids are operably linked to an expression control sequence. Suitable vector backbones include, for example, those routinely used in the art such as plasmids, viruses, artificial chromosomes, BACs, YACs, or PACs. Suitable expression vectors include, without limitation, plasmids and viral vectors derived from, for example, bacteriophage, baculoviruses, and retroviruses. Numerous vectors and expression systems are commercially available from such corporations as Novagen (Madison, WI), Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Vectors typically contain one or more regulatory regions. Regulatory regions include, without limitation, promoter sequences, enhancer sequences, response elements, protein recognition sites, inducible elements, protein binding sequences, 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), transcriptional start sites, termination sequences, polyadenylation sequences, and introns.\n\n\nPreferred promoters controlling transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells may be obtained from various sources, for example, the genomes of viruses such as polyoma, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis B virus and most preferably cytomegalovirus, or from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g. beta actin promoter or EF 1 promoter, or from hybrid or chimeric promoters (e.g. , cytomegalovirus promoter fused to the beta actin promoter). The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. Of course, promoters from the host cell or related species also are useful herein.\n\n\nEnhancer generally refers to a sequence of DNA that functions at no fixed distance from the transcription start site and can be either 5' or 3' to the transcription unit. Furthermore, enhancers can be within an intron as well as within the coding sequence itself. They are usually between 10 and 300 bp in length, and they function in cis. Enhancers usually function to increase transcription from nearby promoters. Enhancers can also contain response elements that mediate the regulation of \n\n transcription. While many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, fetoprotein and insulin), typically one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus for general expression. Preferred examples are the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.\n\n\nOptionally, the promoter and/or enhancer region can act as a constitutive promoter and/or enhancer to maximize expression of the region of the transcription unit to be transcribed. In certain constructs the promoter and/or enhancer region be active in all eukaryotic cell types, even if it is only expressed in a particular type of cell at a particular time. A preferred promoter of this type is the CMV promoter. Other preferred promoters are SV40 promoters, cytomegalovirus (plus a linked intron sequence), beta-actin, elongation factor-1 (EF-I) and retroviral vector LTR.\n\n\nThe vectors also can include, for example, origins of replication, scaffold attachment regions (SARs), and/or markers. A marker gene can confer a selectable phenotype, e.g., antibiotic resistance, on a cell. This marker product is used to determine if the gene has been delivered to the cell and once delivered is being expressed. Examples of marker genes include the E. coli lacZ gene, which encodes β galactosidase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), and luciferase. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, neomycin, neomycin analog G418, hygromycin, and puromycin. When such selectable markers are successfully transferred into a mammalian host cell, the transformed mammalian host cell can survive if placed under selective pressure. In addition, an expression vector can include a tag sequence designed to facilitate manipulation or detection {e.g., purification or localization) of the expressed polypeptide. Tag sequences, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), glutathione S- transferase (GST), polyhistidine, c-myc, hemagglutinin, or Flag™ tag (Kodak, New Haven, CT) sequences typically are expressed as a fusion with the encoded polypeptide. Such tags can be inserted anywhere within the polypeptide, including at either the carboxyl or amino terminus.\n\n\nFurther provided are cultured cells comprising the expression vectors. Such expression vectors and cultured cells can be used to make the provided polypeptides. Thus, the expression vectors disclosed herein containing the above described nucleic \n\n acid sequences can be used, for example, to transfect or transduce either prokaryotic (e.g., bacterial) cells or eukaryotic cells (e.g., yeast, insect, or mammalian) cells. Such cells can then be used, for example, for large or small scale in vitro production of the provided variant APC polypeptides and fragments thereof. Such methods involve culturing the cells under conditions for production of the polypeptides and isolating the polypeptides from the cells or from the culture medium.\n\n\nProvided herein are compositions containing the provided polypeptides or nucleic acids and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The herein provided compositions are administered in vitro or in vivo. By pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material is administered to a subject, e.g., with a variant APC, without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier is selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject.\n\n\nSuitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21\nst\n Edition, David B. Troy, ed., Lippicott Williams & Wilkins (2005). Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically- acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sterile water, saline, buffered solutions like Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is generally from about 5 to about 8 or from about 7 to about 7.5. Other carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunogenic polypeptides. Matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. Certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of composition being administered. Carriers are those suitable for administration of the agent, e.g., the variant APC polypeptide, to humans or other subjects. The compositions are administered via any of several routes of administration, including, for example, topically, orally, parenterally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, transdermally, intrahepatically, intracranially, nebulization/inhalation, or by instillation via bronchoscopy. \n\n Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives are optionally present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like.\n\n\nOptionally, the composition is administered by oral inhalation, nasal inhalation or intranasal mucosal administration. As used herein, these terms mean delivery of the compositions into the nose and nasal passages through one or both of the nares and can comprise delivery by a spraying mechanism or droplet mechanism, or through aerosolization of the nucleic acid or vector. Administration of the compositions by inhalant is through the nose or mouth via delivery by a spraying or droplet mechanism. For example, in the form of an aerosol. Delivery is optionally directly to any area of the respiratory system (e.g., lungs) via intubation. Formulations for topical administration include ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like are optionally necessary or desirable.\n\n\nCompositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets, or tablets. Thickeners, flavorings, diluents, emulsifϊers, dispersing aids or binders are optionally desirable.\n\n\nProvided herein are methods of treating sepsis in a subject. Such methods include administering one or more of the provided nucleic acids, one or more of the provided polypeptides, and combinations thereof to the subject. Optionally, the nucleic acids and/or polypeptides are contained within a pharmaceutical composition as described above. \n\n Optionally, the nucleic acid is administered by a vector comprising the nucleic acid. There are a number of compositions and methods which can be used to deliver nucleic acids to cells, either in vitro or in vivo via, for example, expression vectors. These methods and compositions can largely be broken down into two classes: viral based delivery systems and non-viral based delivery systems. Such methods are well known in the art and readily adaptable for use with the compositions and methods described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, plasmid or viral vectors are agents that transport the disclosed nucleic acids into the cell without degradation and include a promoter yielding expression of the gene in the cells into which it is delivered. Viral vectors are, for example, Adenovirus, Adeno-associated virus, Herpes virus, Vaccinia virus, Polio virus, Sindbis and other RNA viruses, including these viruses with the HIV backbone. Also preferred are any viral families which share the properties of these viruses which make them suitable for use as vectors. Retroviral vectors, in general, are described by Verma, LM. , Retroviral vectors for gene transfer. In Microbiology- 1985, American\n\n\nSociety for Microbiology, pp. 229-232, Washington, (1985), which is incorporated by reference herein for the vectors and methods of making them. The construction of replication-defective adenoviruses has been described (Berkner et al., J. Virology 61 :1213-1220 (1987); Massie et al., MoI. Cell. Biol. 6:2872-2883 (1986); Haj- Ahmad et al., J. Virology 51:261-21 A (1986); Davidson et al., J. Virology 61 :1226- 1239 (1987); Zhang et al., BioTechniques 15:868-872 (1993)). The benefit of the use of these viruses as vectors is that they are limited in the extent to which they can spread to other cell types, since they can replicate within an initial infected cell, but are unable to form new infectious viral particles. Recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to achieve high efficiency after direct, in vivo delivery to airway epithelium, hepatocytes, vascular endothelium, CNS parenchyma and a number of other tissue sites. Other useful systems include, for example, replicating and host- restricted non-replicating vaccinia virus vectors.\n\n\nThe provided polypeptides or nucleic acids can be delivered via virus like particles. Virus like particles (VLPs) consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. Methods for making and using virus like particles are described in, for example, Garcea and Gissmann, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 15:513-7 (2004). \n\n The provided polypeptides can be delivered by subviral dense bodies (DB). DBs transport proteins into target cells by membrane fusion. Methods for making and using DBs are described in, for example, Pepperl-Klindworth et al., Gene Therapy 10(3):278-84 (2003). The provided polypeptides can be delivered by tegument aggregates. Methods for making and using tegument aggregates are described in International Publication NO. WO 2006/110728.\n\n\nOptionally, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an effective amount or effective dosage of the provided polypeptides or nucleic acids. An effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprises a dosage between about 0.01 mg per kg body weight of the subject up to about 100 mg per kg body weight of the subject. The dosage can be, for example, from about 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 to about 25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg. Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition is administered from 0.01 to 50 μg/kg/hr. Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition is administered from 0.1 to 25 μg/kg/hr. Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition is administered as an intravenous infusion. Optionally, 2.5 to 25 mg of the pharmaceutical composition is administered as an intravenous infusion. Doses are administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days.\n\n\nAlso provided herein is a method of treating sepsis in a subject comprising administering to the subject one or more RGD-containing peptides. Optionally, the RGD-containing peptide is a cyclic RGD-containing peptide. Optionally, the RGD- containing peptide is selected from the group consisting of c[RGDD(tøt- butylglycine)(m-ammomethylbenzoic acid)] ; c [(3 -mercaptopropionic acid)RGDD(tert-butylglycine)C]-NH\n2\n; G-c[(penicillamine)RARGDNPC]-A; acetyl- c[(penicillamine)-O-methyltyrosine-ARGDN(tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid)C]-NH\n2\n, and acetylphenylalanine-c[CRGDTFC]-NH\n2\n. Optionally, the RGD- containing peptide is acetyl-c[(penicillamine)-O-methyltyrosine- ARGDN(tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid)C]-NH2. The RGD containing peptides can be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition as described above. The methods optionally include administering one or more other therapeutic or prophylactic regimens. Thus, the provided methods can further comprise the step of administering a second therapeutic agent to the subject. The second therapeutic agent is, optionally, drotrecogin alfa (activated) (Xigris®, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN). \n\n Optionally, the second therapeutic agent is SEQ ID NO:1. Optionally, the second therapeutic agent is an RGD-containing peptide. As used throughout, a therapeutic agent is a compound or composition effective in ameliorating a pathological condition. Illustrative examples of other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, vasopressors, pain killers, and sedatives. Optionally, the anti-inflammatory agent is a corticosteroid. Optionally, the therapeutic agent is an antibody that blocks β 1 or β3 integrin activity.\n\n\nAnti-inflammatory agents, that may be administered in combination with the provided compositions include, but are not limited to steroids, cyclosporine, cyclosporine analogs, cyclophosphamide methylprednisone, prednisone, azathioprine, FK-506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Deerfleld, IL), 15 deoxyspergualin, and other immunosuppressive agents that act by suppressing the function of responding immune cells (including, for example, T cells), directly (e.g., by acting on the immune cell) or indirectly (by acting on other mediating cells). Immunosuppresive agents also include, ORTHOCLONE® (OKT3) (Ortho Biotech, Raritan, NJ), SANDIMMUNE® ORAL (cyclosporine) (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, Hanover, NJ), PROGRAF® (tacrolimus) (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Deerfϊeld, IL), CELLCEPT® (mycophenolate) (Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, NJ), azathioprine, glucorticosteroids, and RAPAMUNE® (sirolimus) (Wyeth, Collegeville, PA). Any of the aforementioned second therapeutic agents or treatment regimes can be used in any combination with the compositions described herein. Combinations are administered either concomitantly (e.g., as an admixture), separately but simultaneously (e.g., via separate intravenous lines into the same subject), or sequentially (e.g., one of the compounds or agents is given first followed by the second). Thus, the term combination is used to refer to either concomitant, simultaneous, or sequential administration of two or more agents.\n\n\nThe terms effective amount and effective dosage are used interchangeably. The term effective amount is defined as any amount necessary to produce a desired physiologic response. Effective amounts and schedules for administering the compositions are determined empirically. The dosage ranges for the administration of the compositions are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which the symptoms or disorder are affected. The dosage is not so large as to cause substantial adverse side effects, such as unwanted cross-reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and the \n\n like. Generally, the dosage varies with the age, condition, sex, type of disease and extent of the disease in the patient, route of administration, or whether other drugs are included in the regimen, and is determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage is optionally adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Also provided are methods of screening for polypeptides with enhanced APC activity. The method includes contacting a polypeptide to be tested with a cell expressing one or both of βl integral and β3 integral, wherein the polypeptide to be tested comprises APC or a fragment thereof comprising one or more amino acid substitutions, and determining whether the polypeptide to be tested binds to the βl integrin or β3 integrin better than a control APC or fragment thereof, wherein binding better than the control indicates the polypeptide to be tested has enhanced APC activity. Optionally, the contacting step includes contacting a cell expressing the polypeptide to be tested with the cell expressing one or both of βl integrin and β3 integrin. Optionally, the polypeptide to be tested is made by mutagenizing APC or a fragment thereof using, e.g., error-prone PCR. Optionally, the control APC comprises SEQ ID NO: 1.\n\n\nAlso provided is a method of screening for an agent for treatment of sepsis including contacting the agent to be screened with a cell expressing one or both of βl integrin and β3 integrin, contacting an APC or fragment thereof with the cell, and determining whether the agent competes with APC for binding to the βl integrin or β3 integrin. If the agent competes with APC for binding, this indicates the agent is suitable for treatment of sepsis. Optionally, the APC comprises SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, the APC or fragment thereof comprises an RGD motif.\n\n\nThe polypeptide, nucleic acids, compositions and combinations thereof described herein can be assembled in kits. Thus, provided are kits comprising one or more of the provided nucleic acids and a container. Also provided are kits comprising one or more of the provided polypeptides and a container. Suitable containers include vials, packets, or intravenous bags. Optionally, the kit includes measured amounts of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising the nucleic acid or polypeptide. The kit can also include instruments useful in administration, such as needles, syringes, tubing, catheters, bandages, and tape. The kits can also include instructions for use. \n\n As used throughout, by a subject is meant an individual. Thus, the subject can include, for example, domesticated animals, such as cats and dogs, livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, and goats), laboratory animals (e.g., mice, rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs), mammals, non-human mammals, primates, non-human primates, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and any other animal. The subject can be a mammal such as a primate or a human. The term subject also includes individuals of different ages. Thus, a subject includes an infant, child, teenager or adult.\n\n\nAs used herein the terms treatment, treat or treating refers to a method of reducing the effects of a disease or condition or symptom of the disease or condition. Thus in the disclosed method, treatment can refer to a 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% reduction in the severity of an established disease or condition or symptom of the disease or condition. For example, a method for treating a disease is considered to be a treatment if there is a 5% reduction in one or more symptoms of the disease in a subject as compared to control. Thus the reduction can be a 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100% or any percent reduction in between 10 and 100 as compared to native or control levels. It is understood that treatment does not necessarily refer to a cure or complete ablation of the disease, condition or symptoms of the disease or condition.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms prevent, preventing and prevention of a disease or disorder refers to an action, for example, administration of a therapeutic agent, that occurs before or at about the same time a subject begins to show one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder, which inhibits or delays onset or exacerbation of one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder. As used herein, references to decreasing, reducing, or inhibiting include a change of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ,60, 70 ,80, 90 percent or greater as compared to a control level. Such terms can include but do not necessarily include complete elimination.\n\n\nDisclosed are materials, compositions, and components that can be used for, can be used in conjunction with, can be used in preparation for, or are products of the disclosed methods and compositions. These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutations of these compounds may not be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For \n\n example, if a substitution or modification is disclosed and discussed and a number of other substitutions or modifications that can be made, each and every combination and permutation can be combined, and the modifications that are possible are specifically contemplated unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Likewise, any subset or combination of these is also specifically contemplated and disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this disclosure including, but not limited to, steps in methods of using the disclosed compositions. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed, it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific method steps or combination of method steps of the disclosed methods, and that each such combination or subset of combinations is specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed.\n\n\nThroughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application. A number of aspects have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. Furthermore, when one characteristic or step is described it can be combined with any other characteristic or step herein even if the combination is not explicitly stated. Accordingly, other aspects are within the scope of the claims. Examples\n\n\nExample 1. Direct binding of activated protein C to integrins and its protective effects in sepsis.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nReagents. Recombinant Human APC (rhAPC) was obtained from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). The protein C mutant containing GIu substitutions in place of Asp- 222 (D222E) was constructed by overlap extension PCR. The inner complementary primers were 5 '-GACCAGGCGGGGAGAGAGCCCCTGGCAGGTG-S ' (SEQ ID NO:33) and 5 '-CACCTGCCAGGGGCTCTCTCCCCGCCTGGTC-S ' (SEQ ID NO:34). The outer primers corresponded to vector plasmid cDNA (pRC/CMV) bases 837 to 856 and 1038 to 1065. The second round PCR product was digested with HindIII and Xbal, and inserted into pcDNA 3.1(+)/Hygro vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mutant zymogen was expressed in HEK293 cells, purified and converted to activated protein C by thrombin, and separated from thrombin by an \n\n FPLC Mono Q column as described (Bae et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104:2867 (2007)).\n\n\nDNA Plasmids and Constructs. For hEPCR-mCFP, PCR extensions were performed on wild type hEPCR cDNAin pSVzeo as a template. The upstream primer 5'- ATATAAAGCTTGCCACCATGTTGACAACATTGCTGCC-S' (SEQ ID NO:35) with a HindIII site and the downstream primer 5'-\n\n\nTATATACCGGTCCACATCGCCGTCCACCTGTGC-3' (SEQ ID NO:36) with a Agel site were used with hEPCR-pSVzeo. After digestion with HindIII and Agel, the PCR fragment was inserted into HindIII and Agel digested pECFP. For βl-mYFP with 5 amino acid residue linker, PCR extension was performed using wild type βl subunit cDNA (Genbank Accession No. BC020057) as a template with the upstream primer 5'-\n\n\nATATACTCGAGGCCACCATGAATTTACAACCAATTTT-S' (SEQ ID NO:37) containing Xhol site and the downstream primer 5'- TATATACCGGTCCTTTTCCCTCATACTTCGGAT-S' (SEQ ID NO:38) containing Agel site. After digestion with Xhol and Agel, PCR product and mYFP then ligated to generate βl(5)-mYFP containing 5 amino acid residue linker of GPVAT. Monomeric mCFP and mYFP mutants were generated by replacing Leu-221 at the crystallographic dimer interface with a Lys. Human neutrophil preparation. Blood was collected from healthy volunteers via antecubital vein puncture in heparin or EDTA-containing vacutainers. Granulocytes and erythrocytes were separated from whole blood by centrifugation through a Histopaque 1077 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) density gradient. The cell suspension containing neutrophils was collected and washed with HBSS-/- (without calcium or magnesium) at 1250 rpm for 10 min at 4\n0\nC. Remaining erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis, yielding a neutrophil purity of greater than 98%. Neutrophils were resuspended in cold HBSS-/- for experimentation.\n\n\nUnder-agarose migration assay. Delta T dishes (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) were coated with fϊbronectin (FN). Plates were then rinsed with the appropriate media and allowed to air-dry. Molten agarose (Seakem GTG, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) was prepared as described (Harler et al., J Immunol., 162:6792 (1999)). Two milliliters of the resulting gel was added to each dish and allowed to solidify at 4\n0\nC for 5 min. Three wells that were 2 mm apart were prepared in the agarose using a template and a \n\n beveled punch that was coated with polymixin B. Care was taken to ensure that the plate bottom was not scratched. Punch sections were removed with an aspirator, and the gel was then equilibrated for one hour at 37°C. The wells were then aspirated and loaded with 30 ml of one of the following: PBS (left well), a suspension containing approximately 200,000 cells (middle well), or a solution containing 5 pmol of fMLP (right well). A subset of cells was treated with 10 μg/ml rhAPC at 37°C for 20 min prior to being loaded into the wells. The dishes were incubated for 60 min at 37\n0\nC, and then fixed with 10% buffered formalin. Counts were then made of the number of cells that had migrated 1 mm towards the right well (towards fMLP, directional migration), 0.5 mm towards the left and right wells (\"straddle\"), and 1 mm towards the left well (random migration). The experiments were repeated three times per condition.\n\n\nMeasurement of random migration and micropipette assay. Delta T dishes were coated with human FN (50 μg/ml, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for overnight at 4°C and then for 4 h at room temperature. Plates were then rinsed with L- 15 media. Human neutrophils (approximately 500,000) were incubated, in the presence or absence of 10 μg /ml of wild type rhAPC or mutant RGE-APC in 500 μl L- 15 media containing 2 mg/ml glucose for 20 min at 37°C. The cells were then added to FN- coated dishes in 1.5 ml of L- 15 with 2 mg/ml of glucose. For neutrophil live cell staining, 2 μM Green Cell Tracker CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was used. Temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the experiment using a FCS2 live-cell imaging chamber (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Images were acquired for 30 to 60 minutes under a 10x objective lens using a Nikon TE-2000U inverted microscope. Phase contrast images were acquired every 5 seconds and fluorescence images every 30 seconds. Cell paths were traced using MetaVue™ imaging software (Molecular Devices Corporation, Downingtown, PA).\n\n\nRandom migration was investigated by adding fMLP or IL-8 to media at a final concentration of 10\n\"8\nM and analyzed by manually tracing the outline of each cell in selected frames (i.e., at 50 second intervals). The x and y coordinates of each cell were measured using ImageJ software and were corrected so that the starting position was x =0 and y = 0. \n\n Directional migration was investigated using a micropipette assay to analyze the dynamics of neutrophil migration on different integrin ligands. Sterile Femtotips II micropipette tips (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) were loaded with 5 μl of 1 μM fMLP and then placed on the bottom of FN-coated delta T dishes that had been pre- warmed to 37\n0\nC. Image acquisition began within 2 minutes of tip placement.\n\n\nThe time-lapsed images of migrating neutrophils were taken under phase contrast microscopy. Each image was thresholded and binarized based on brightness to define the centroids of the neutrophils. The closest centroids between consecutive images were linked as a trajectory under the assumption that these centroids were made by the same neutrophil. The maximum distance between the closest centroids was also defined to preclude the artifacts due to cells moving into and out of the field of view. To demonstrate the randomness of chemokinesis and the distances that each cell travel, the starting points of the trajectories of the neutrophils were translated to the origin. FACS analysis . Neutrophils were pretreated with 10 μg/ml of rhAPC in HB S (20 mM Hepes, pH7.5, 140 mM NaCl) + 1 mM Ca\n2+\n and 1 mM Mg\n2+\n, or +3 mM Ca\n2+\n and 0.6 mM Mg\n2+\n for 30 min at 37\n0\nC. LIBS mAbs (B44 and D3) were added 5 minutes prior to fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then cells were washed and incubated with PE-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark. Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS for FACS analysis. Neutrophil Adhesion Assays. The adhesion assay was carried out essentially as described (Vorup-Jensen et al., PNAS 102: 1614 (2005)). Cover slips were coated with FN in coating buffer (150 mM NaCl/20 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.0) for over night at 4°C and for 4 hours at room temperature. Residual binding sites were blocked by incubation of the wells with 0.05% (wt/vol) polyvinylpyrrolidone in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. 2.5 x 10\n5\n/250 μl of neutrophils were suspended in L15 medium plus 2mg/ml glucose and pretreated for 15 minutes at 37°C with 10 μg/ml rhAPC, 50 μg/ml human EPCR blocking mAb (RCR-252), or 10 μg/ml Gla-less rhAPC (Enzyme Research Lab., IN). The cover slips were aspirated, and washed with L15 medium. 250 μl of L15/2mg/ml glucose medium containing 10 μg/ml rhAPC, 50 μg/ml human EPCR blocking mAb, or 10 μg/ml Gla-less rhAPC, with/without 20 nM fMLP was placed on each cover slip and prewarmed for 15 minutes at 37°C. Cells (250 μl) were then immediately added, and further incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. \n\n Unbound cells were then washed with warm Ll 5 medium. The bound cells were then fixed with formaldehyde. For each experimental condition from three independent donors, five random phase-contrast images were obtained, and the number of cells in each well was scored from printed micrographs. Integrin ligand binding assay. The solid phase binding assay was performed using purified soluble human α3βl, α5βl, and αVβ3 (US Biological, Swampscott, MA). Two (2) μg/ml of soluble integrins were added to microtiter wells for capture with immobilized monoclonal antibody against βl or β3 subunits (mAb TS2/6 for βl and mAb BBlO (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for β3 integrins). 10 μg/ml rhAPC, 10 μg/ml RGE-APC, or 5 μg/ml of human FN was incubated in the presence of 1 mM Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n plus 1 mM Mn\n2+\n for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, bound APC was chromogenically detected by peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate anti-PC (Diapharma, West Chester, OH) or chromogenic substrate S-2366 (Diapharma, West Chester, OH). To minimize dissociation, all wash buffers contained 1 mM Mn\n2+\n, and <15 minutes elapsed between the end of binding and beginning of color development. Functional blocking antibodies for integrins were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Intracellular Ca\n2+\n measurement. 1x10\n7\n cells/ml of human neutrophils were labeled with 5μM Fluo-4 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37\n0\nC for 30 minutes, then at room temperature for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. After washing twice, cells were resuspended to 4x10\n6\n cells/ml (6ml) in F15 and incubated at RT for de-esterification. For measurements, cells (4xlO\n6\n) were spun down in a microtube (ImI), resuspend in ImI of F15 at 37\n0\nC, transferred to a quartz cuvette containing a fluorometric stir bar and ImI of the same buffer at 37°C, and fluorescence signals were measured in the fluorometer. FRET. Dynamic FRET imaging was carried out using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped with a Dual-View (Optical Insights, Tucson, AZ) and CFP/YFP dual-band filter set (Chroma, Rockingham, VT). TIRF imaging was performed with a white light TIRF aperture diaphragm and a 10OX TIRF 1.49 NA oil immersion objective coupled to a QuantEM EMCCD (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). The microscope was controlled by NIS element software (Nikon,\n\n\nMelville, NY) and data analysis was performed with AutoDeblur (Autoquant Imaging, Troy, NY) by the sensitized emission method (Gordon et al., Biophys. J. 74:2702 (1998)). 48 hours after co-transfection with hEPCR-mCFP and βl-mYFP DNA \n\n construct in Delta T dish (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and then 1 ml L15 medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml D-glucose. Cells were equilibrated for about 10 minutes at 37°C in a FCS2 live cell imaging chamber (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Then each image of CFP, YFP, and bright field of cells was taken for 0.1 second for hEPCR-mCFP and 1 second for βl-mYFP with 2 x 2 binning through a 10Ox oil immersion objective lens every 10 seconds for 15 minutes.\n\n\nNeutrophil recruitment into airspace. Mice (C57BL/6, 6-8 weeks) were anesthetized with avertin and then intranasally administered 30 μg of LPS (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Two hours later the mice were tail vain injected with rhAPC or RGE- APC (10 μg/mouse) or PBS. Mice were sacrificed 4 hours later and bronchoalveolar lavage was harvested. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes. Cells were counted using microbeads (Polyscience, Niles, IL) by flow cytometry. Cells were stained with Gr-I APC antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and collected by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP was used to induce acute septic peritonitis as described (Rhee et al., J Surg Res 115:74 (2003)). Briefly, mice (C57BL/6, 6-8 weeks) were anesthetized using inhaled Isofiurane, a midline incision (approximately lcm) was made below the diaphragm, the cecum was excised to the surface, ligated approximately 4cm distal and then punctured through and through with a 22-gauge needle. Cecum was gently squeezed to excise its contents. Sham animals underwent the same procedure with no ligation or puncture. The abdominal incision was then closed in layers with Ethilon 6.0 suture. Mice were resuscitated with 1.0 ml of Ringer's solution via subcutaneous injection. Animals recovered under a heat lamp for approximately 30 minutes and were allowed food and water ad lib. Results\n\n\nAfter transendothelial migration, neutrophils cross the basal lamina and migrate through the extracellular matrix and into tissue or sites of inflammation. To investigate the effects of rhAPC on neutrophil adhesion to the matrix proteins, a cell adhesion assay was performed on fibronectin (FN)-coated cover glass. Human neutrophils were allowed to adhere to immobilized FN in the presence of the chemoattractant, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). The addition of rhAPC \n\n significantly reduced fMLP -induced adhesion. To investigate the effects of rhAPC on the migration of neutrophils on matrix proteins, live-cell imaging of neutrophils migrating on fibronectin (FN)-coated cover glass was performed in the presence of fMLP. Cell tracking analysis revealed that fMLP significantly increased the random migration of neutrophils on FN, and the presence of rhAPC dramatically reduced this effect (Fig. IA).\n\n\nDuring an infection, chemoattractants are released from various sources including the vascular endothelium, interstitial cells (macrophages and mast cells), and the infectious agent itself. Directional migration of neutrophils toward the chemokine gradients is critical to reach the site of infection. Therefore, the effect of rhAPC on neutrophil directional migration was tested using the under-agarose assay. Neutrophils were seeded in a well flanked by two wells containing either fMLP or PBS (Fig. IB, upper panel). The majority of neutrophils migrated toward the fMLP- containing well, suggesting that the chemoattractant diffused toward the middle well. As with random migration, rhAPC decreased directional migration of neutrophils on FN towards fMLP (Fig. IB). The effect of rhAPC on the dynamics of directional neutrophil migration was further investigated using the micropipette assay. In this assay, a micropipette tip containing fMLP was placed in a field of cells to establish a chemokine gradient. Consistent with results obtained using the under-agarose assay, neutrophil migration on FN toward the tip was dramatically decreased by rhAPC pre- treatment (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of over 30 neutrophils in each group revealed that rhAPC decreased the average lateral migration speed (S) more than 2.5 fold, without significantly altering the migratory index (distance from origin/total distance traveled; MI) or the direction of movement (KD) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that, although neutrophils can sense chemoattractants and become polarized toward chemoattractant gradients in the presence of rhAPC, they cannot move toward the gradient. This was further supported by measurement of intracellular calcium mobilization by fMLP in the presence/absence of rhAPC. Dynamic measurement of intracellular Ca\n2+\n showed that rhAPC had no effect on the increase in Ca\n2+\n concentration by fMLP treatment (Fig. IE), suggesting that rhAPC did not functionally alter the signaling pathway associated with chemotaxis receptors on neutrophil. \n\n Neutrophils must follow both endogenous and bacterial chemoattractant signals out of the vasculature and through the interstitium to arrive at a site of infection. To investigate whether rhAPC inhibited neutrophil migration induced by host-derived chemoattractants, IL-8 was used in the migration assay. Consistent with results obtained using fMLP, neutrophil migration on FN by IL-8 was dramatically decreased by rhAPC pre-treatment (Fig. ID). In accord with its ability to block neutrophil migration, rhAPC also abolished the adhesion of human neutrophils to immobilized FN induced by fMLP (Fig. 2A).\n\n\nThe best characterized integrin binding motif is the RGD sequence, which is present in FN, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and a variety of other adhesion proteins. Many integrins that bind to extracellular protein ligands including α3βl, α5βl, αllbβ3, and αVβ3, specifically interact with the RGD sequence of their target proteins. As shown in Fig. 2B, amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the catalytic domain of human protein C and APC also contains the RGD sequence. Therefore, it was hypothesized that rhAPC directly interacts with neutrophil integrins to regulate cell migration. To test this hypothesis, rhAPC-binding assays were performed with neutrophils in suspension. The assay buffer containing ImM Ca\n2+\n and ImM Mg\n2+\n was supplemented with ImM Mn\n2+\n to activate cell surface integrins. This significantly increased rhAPC binding to the neutrophil surface (Fig. 2C). The addition of blocking mAbs against βl or β3 integrins partially displaced rhAPC from the cell surface (Fig. 2C). The presence of both βl and β3 integrin blocking mAbs further reduced rhAPC binding on neutrophil surface (Fig. 2C). Cyclic RGD peptide also significantly inhibited rhAPC binding, while blocking anti-β2 integrin (non-RGD binding integrin) mAb had no effect (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results showed that the major mechanism that controls rhAPC binding to the neutrophil surface was through direct interaction with the integrins.\n\n\nUpon ligand binding, integrins undergo pronounced conformational changes that result in the appearance of ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS), which can be detected by specific monoclonal antibodies. The direct binding of rhAPC to βl and β3 integrins on intact neutrophils was tested by measuring the appearance of LIBS using B44 mAb (βl integrin LIBS Ab) and D3 mAb (β3 integrin LIBS Ab). In the presence of ImM Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n, rhAPC strongly induced B44 and D3 binding (Fig. 2D). The binding of APC to EPCR is Ca\n2+\n-dependent, with ion concentrations of \n\n 3mM CaCl\n2\n and 0.6mM MgCb being optimal for binding (Liaw et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:8364 (2001)). However, Ca\n2+\n has been shown to exert a negative regulatory effect on integrin-ligand binding (Ruoslahti, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57:375 (1988)). Consistent with this finding, APC did not induce the LIBS Abs binding in the presence of 3mM CaCl\n2\n and 0.6mM MgCl\n2\n (Fig. 2D). These data suggested that APC induced conformational changes in neutrophil integrins through direct interaction with the integrins and not through signals resulting from its interaction with EPCR on the neutrophil surface.\n\n\nAmong the neutrophil integrins that recognize the RGD motif, α3βl, α5βl, and αVβ3 are key in regulating neutrophil chemotaxis (Yauch et al., MoI. Biol. Cell 9:2751 (1998); Burns et al., J. Immunol. 166:4644 (2001); Sixt et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276: 18878 (2001)). To test whether APC can bind directly to the integrins, an ELISA-like solid phase receptor-binding assay was performed (Fig. 2E). Soluble α3βl, α5βl, and αVβ3 were captured onto microtiter wells using mAbs specific for βl or β3. Binding to FN or rhAPC was then measured in buffer containing ImM Mn\n2+\n, ImM Ca\n2+\n, and ImM Mg\n2+\n. As shown in Fig. 2E, FN and rhAPC bound to all three integrins, and this binding was specific, as shown by its reversibility in the presence of integrin-b locking mAbs.\n\n\nTo determine whether rhAPC binds to βl and β3 integrins through its RGD sequence, the RGD sequence was mutated to RGE (RGE-APC). SDS-PAGE analysis of protein C zymogens prior to and following activation by thrombin indicated that the molecular weight and glycosylation of RGE-APC was similar to that of wild type APC. Enzyme assays using the chromogenic substrate, S-2366, revealed that the Km and kcat of RGE-APC were also comparable to those for wild-type APC (Table 2).\n\n\nTable 2. Enzyme kinetic constants of wild type APC and RGE-APC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these similarities, the direct binding of RGE-APC to soluble α3βl, α5βl, and αVβ3 integrins was significantly less than that of wild type APC, as measured by the \n\n solid phase receptor-binding assays (Fig. 2F). In random migration assay, RGE-APC had no effect on the migration of neutrophils on FN, while the presence of wild type rhAPC dramatically reduced the migration (Fig. 2G). To investigate whether activation of PC is required for the inhibition of neutrophil migration and adhesion, the zymogen PC (rhPC) was tested in migration and adhesion assays. Unlike rhAPC, rhPC failed to block neutrophil migration on FN (Fig. 2G) and also failed to block neutrophil adhesion. The recombinant APC variant S360A-APC, however, which lacks protealytic activity (Gale et al., Protein Sci. 6:132-140 (1997)) successfully inhibited neutrophil migration. Thus, these data show that the RGD sequence in rhAPC was an essential feature of its direct interaction with the neutrophil integrins and for inhibition of neutrophil migration on matrix proteins. These data also show that APCs enzymatic proteolytic activity is not necessary for the inhibition.\n\n\nEPCR was the first identified cellular APC receptor and is expressed in healthy human neutrophils and monocytes (Sturn et al., Blood 102:1499 (2003)). Because activated neutrophils contribute to organ system dysfunction and mortality in sepsis, we first compared EPCR expression between unstimulated and fMLP- stimulated neutrophils. Reverse-transcription PCR revealed that healthy neutrophils expressed EPCR mRNA (Fig. 3A). Cell surface expression of EPCR could also be detected in these cells, although the overall levels of the receptor were very low (Fig. 3A). Stimulation with fMLP dramatically enhanced cell surface expression of EPCR (Fig. 3A).\n\n\nPreviously, it was shown that neutrophil migration through nitrocellulose micropore filter (without any protein coatings) was inhibited by rhAPC and the inhibition was reversed by an EPCR blocking Ab (Sturn et al., Blood 102:1499 (2003)). However, in our neutrophil adhesion assay to immobilized FN, Gla-less\n\n\nAPC, a mutant form of APC that lacks the EPCR binding motif (Regan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:26279 (1997)), inhibited adhesion to a slightly less, but similar, degree as the wild type protein (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it was tested whether the anti-EPCR antibody relieved the rhAPC-induced inhibition of neutrophil adhesion on FN. Blocking of neutrophil EPCR with high concentration of antibody only partially, but significantly, reversed the inhibitory effect of rhAPC on neutrophil binding to FN (Fig. 3B). In endothelial cells, EPCR-bound APC can mediate signals through PAR-I (Riewald et al., Science 296: 1880 (2002)) and SlPl receptors (Feistritzer and \n\n Riewald, Blood 105:3178 (2005); Finigan et al, J. Biol. Chem. 280:17286 (2005)). However, agonists of PAR-I (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF (SEQ ID NO: 39)) and SlPl (SEW2871) did not reverse the inhibitory effect of rhAPC on neutrophil migration. Thus these results show that rhAPC can bind to EPCR and βl/β3 integrins simultaneously on the neutrophil surface (Fig. 3C), where EPCR provides a supportive role for the integrin binding. To investigate the double occupation of rhAPC on living cell surface, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis was employed to measure the energy transfer between monomeric yellow fluorescent protein (mYFP) and monomeric cyan fluorescent protein (mCFP) as a function of distance (Fig. 3C). A C-terminal CFP-tagged EPCR (EPCR-mCFP) and YFP-tagged βl integrin (βl-mYFP) were constructed (Fig. 3C and 3D). EPCR-mCFP and βl- mYFP were transiently co-trans fected into the EPCR deficient HEK293, where they localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3E). To test if there was a decrease in the distance between EPCR and βl integrins by rhAPC ligation, dynamic FRET was used to measure changes in the relative proximity of these cell surface proteins in the presence of rhAPC or GLA-less APC. Since the ligand will only bind to cell surface receptors, optical measurements were confined to the plasma membrane using through the objective total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). Dynamic FRET measurements on TIRF microscopy showed a significant increase in FRET efficiency after rhAPC treatment (Fig. 3F). No obvious FRET change was observed with Gla-less APC (Fig. 3F). Therefore these data support the hypothesis that rhAPC recruits EPCR and βl integrins in close proximity, within 100 A, on cell membrane through simultaneous binding to EPCR and the integrins.\n\n\nIntravenous administration of rhAPC is known to reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary inflammation by attenuating neutrophil chemotaxis towards the alveolar compartment. To show that the protective effect of rhAPC in vivo is associated with its interaction with neutrophil integrins and its suppression of neutrophil migration, LPS instillation induced neutrophil recruitment into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was determined by flow cytometry. Neutrophil recruitment in the BALF was significantly reduced by rhAPC, but not by RGE-APC, injection (Fig. 4A). To further prove that the RGD sequence in rhAPC is important for its beneficial effects in sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was induced and the survivals of septic mice were measured in the absence or presence of a RGD \n\n peptide that has high affinity to both βl and β3 integrins (acetyl-c[(penicillamine)-(9- methyltyronsine-ARGDN(tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid)C]-NH\n2\n; Mattern et al, Cancer Ther. 3A:325 (2005)). In 'mid-grade' sepsis (50% survival) (Rittirsch et al., Nat. Med. 14:551 (2008)), treatment of mice with the RGD peptide reproducibly prolonged the time of survival, but there was no significant change in the 7-day mortality (Fig. 4B). Administration of rhAPC significantly reduced mortality in a subset of patients with severe sepsis (Bernard et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 344:699 (2001)), and currently it is indicated for use in patients with sepsis involving acute organ dysfunction and a high risk of death. In order to examine whether the RGD peptide alters mortality in 'high-grade' sepsis, 90% mortality was induced by endotoxemia. When LPS was given at LD\n90\n, a single dose of the RGD peptide reduced mortality from 90 to 60% (Fig. 4C). These findings demonstrated that the blocking of integrins by rhAPC was critical for the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and for the protection in sepsis. Given the complexity of the systemic inflammatory response to infection, it is not surprising that many targeted therapies in sepsis have not been able to improve survival. rhAPC was the first drug approved by the FDA for this indication but its broad application has been questioned. Nonetheless, improvements in current APC therapy and development of better targeted, more efficient anti-sepsis therapies have been hampered by a lack of understanding of the exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of rhAPC on organ function and survival rate in sepsis. The results presented here demonstrate that rhAPC inhibits neutrophil adhesion and migration on extracellular matrix proteins by directly binding to integrins (β 1 and β3 integrins) at the neutrophil surface. Therefore, leukocyte integrins are cellular receptors for rhAPC and specific APC-integrin interactions inhibit neutrophil migration. If the beneficial effects of rhAPC on sepsis are mediated, in part, by diminishing integrin-mediated neutrophil infiltration into the inflamed tissue, then anti-integrin reagents may be used as therapies for severe sepsis or as a combination therapy with rhAPC to improve the clinical outcomes of rhAPC treatment. Example 2. rhAPC Mutants with High Affinity for Integrins.\n\n\nIf the primary effects of rhAPC on sepsis are attributable both to protection of endothelium and to changes in integrin-mediated neutrophil migration, then modifications of rhAPC that have higher affinity to the neutrophil integrins, and still \n\n affect endothelial function through the EPCR, may result in a more potent and better- targeted anti-sepsis therapy.\n\n\nThe crystal structures of the complex of RGD peptide and integrin αVβ3 have been solved. The peptide binds with its Arg contacting the α subunit/β propeller domain and its Asp ligated to a Mn\n2+\n held in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) of the β subunit I-like domain. The calculated buried area of the RGD motif in the αVβ3 crystal is 373A, which is close to the reported value, 355A. The solvent accessible surface area of rhAPC RGD motif was calculated, which is comparable to the buried area of the complex. The solvent accessible surface area of rhAPC RGD motif was 140A. Amain reason for the small buried area was that the light chain covers a part of the RGD motif in the catalytic domain (Fig. 5).\n\n\nSpecifically, the C-terminal of the light chain covered the RGD motif of the catalytic domain. The light chain was removed and the buried area of the rhAPC RGD motif was recalculated. The buried area of the RGD motif was 208A. However, the area of the RGD motif was still smaller than that of αVβ3 (Table 3). Table 3. RGD Motif Surface Accessible Areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data show that accessibility of the RGD motif in wild type rhAPC was not optimal for integrin binding.\n\n\nThe structures of rhAPC RGD motif and RGD peptide in complex were compared with αVβ3. The coordinates were superimposed and it was found that the two structures are different. The rhAPC RGD motif had a different side-chain orientation compared to the αVβ3 RGD motif, which suggested the presence of potential steric clash when the wild type rhAPC RGD motif binds to the integrins. \n\n To increase the affinity of APC for integrins, the accessibility and structure of the RGD motif was altered. As mentioned above, the conformation of the RGD motif was not optimal for integrin binding. Therefore, subtle conformational changes around the area were used to enhance the affinity of APC to the integrins. A broad-range of hosts and scaffolds based on ribosome display, phage display, and cell-surface display are used widely as systems to implement directed evolution (Hoogenboom, Nat. Biotechnol. 23:1105 (2005)). Among the cell surface display systems based on microbial and eukaryotic hosts, the yeast system offers the unique advantage of eukaryotic machinery that enables post-translational modification, glycosylation, and disulfide isomerization (Wittrup, Curr. Opin.\n\n\nBiotechnol. 12:392 (2001)). The yeast surface display was used to screen variants of high affinity rhAPC. The yeast display system that was used employs the α- agglutinin yeast adhesion receptor to display recombinant proteins on cell surface of S. cerevisiae. The receptor consists of two proteins, Agal and Aga2 (Fig. 6). Agal is secreted and becomes covalently attached to β-glucan in the extracellular matrix of the yeast cell wall. Aga2 binds to Agal through two disulfide bonds, making it possible to express a protein of interest fused to Aga2.\n\n\nA cDNA library was constructed by error-prone PCR using nucleotide analogues and a mutagenesis kit (GeneMorph® II Random Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to introduce a comparable ratio of transition (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine) to transversion (purine to pyrimidine or pyrimidine to purine) mutations. Mixtures of 1 μg cDNA library and 0.5 μg of the Nhel/BamHl linearized pCTCON vector in 5 μl were transformed into 10\n8\n yeast cells by electroporation, which lead to ~10\n6\n diversity in the library. Inside the cells, the cDNA library was recombined into the vector by the endogenous Gap repair protein. The yeast library of the human protein C was activated by thrombin. Progressive enrichment of cells encoding high affinity APC was done by panning. Yeast cells that display APC variants were allowed to bind to βl and β3 integrin expressing HEK293T cells. Yeast cells with high affinity APC remained bound, while others were removed by washing. Those that remained were eluted for further analysis.\n\n\nThe mutant APC yeast library was selected by panning on HEK293T cells. After five cycles of panning (Figs. 7A and 7B), the percentage of cells that bound to HEK293T cells was dramatically increased. A total of 20 yeast colonies selected with \n\n panning were sequenced. Of these, 12 had unique sequences and were designated as\n\n\nC212R (the amino acid sequence was numbered as described (Mather et al., EMBO J.\n\n\n15:6822 (1996))) (Fig. 8). This mutation is distantly located from the RGD motif.\n\n\nHowever, the disulfide bond formed by C212 connects anti-parallel beta-sheets, which are directly connected to the loops including RGD motif. Therefore, the mutation could destabilize the structure and expose the RGD motif for more favorable integrin binding.\n\n\nA second panning of the mutant APC yeast library on HEK293T cells was performed. After five cycles of panning, the percentage of cells bound to HEK293T cells was dramatically increased. More than 50 yeast colonies selected with the second round of panning were sequenced. Of these, 12 had the unique sequence designated as D172N (SEQ ID NO:43). This mutation is distantly located from the\n\n\nRGD motif.\n\n\nA rational design approach to generate high affinity mutant APC was also employed. According to the crystal structure of human APC, several neighboring positive charged amino acids form hydrogen bonds with the RGD sequence.\n\n\nMutations to remove the hydrogen bonds were constructed and displayed on the yeast surface. Mutant APCs, KR146/147GG-APC and R177G-APC, showed enhanced binding compared to WT APC (Fig. 9A). When these mutations were combined (KR146/147GG+R177G), the adhesion was further enhanced (Figs. 9A and 9B). An additional mutation, K146R, was also identified. The data suggest that these point mutations increased the affinity of APC to integrins."
