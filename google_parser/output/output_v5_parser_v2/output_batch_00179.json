Description\n\n\n\n\n CHLAMYDIA VACCINE COMPRISING HtrA POLYPEPTIDES\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nField of Invention\n\n\n[0001] This invention relates to a vaccine useful against infection by Chlamydia sp. (e.g., C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae), a process for making the vaccine, and a method for immunizing a human or animal against Chlamydia infection.\n\n\n[0002] Bacteria of the family Chlamydiaceae infect a variety of host species and are associated with a wide range of different disease pathologies, including genital, ocular and neonatal infection. C. trachomatis is the world's most common cause of sexually transmitted disease. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 90 million people are infected each year. In the United States, genital infection with C. trachomatis is the single most frequently reported infectious disease, with an estimated 4 million cases per year. Approximately 10% of women suffering C. trachomatis genital infection eventually become infertile. Children born to C. trachomatis -infected mothers are at high risk of ocular and respiratory infection. C. trachomatis is also a leading cause of ocular infection in tropical and sub-tropical nations, causing blindness in an estimated 6 million people per year. (Schachter, Julius, Chapter 6, \"Infection and Disease Epidemiology,\" pp 139-169., in Chlamydia: Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis and Immunity, Stephens, Richard S., ed., ASM Press, Washington, DC, 1999.; Hogan, et al, Infect Immun., 72(4): 1843-555 (2004); Peipert, N Engl J Med, 349:2424-30 (2003)).\n\n\n[0003] Chlamydiaceae possess a unique developmental cycle which allows them to evade host immune responses: Chlamydiaceae exist inside a eukaryotic host cell as a non-infectious reticulate body (RB), or, alternately, outside a host cell as an infectious elementary body (EB). Chlamydia reproduces inside the host cell as RBs then develops into EBs, which exit the host in order to spread to neighboring cells. The critical step in establishment of Chlamydia infection is adhesion of an infectious EB to a target cell followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis, or other mechanism of high-affinity absorption, termed \"parasite specific endocytosis.\" Chlamydia cell surface antigens are widely believed to direct both \"parasite specific endocytosis\" and also host immune responses.\n\n\n[0004] In general, antibiotic treatment of C. trachomatis genital infection is effective only during early stages of infection, which are typically asymptomatic. Most victims don't realize \n\n they're infected until later stages, when antibiotics are no longer particularly useful. Accordingly, efforts have been undertaken worldwide to identify whole organism or sub-unit vaccines that are protective against C. trachomatis infection.\n\n\n[0005] No effective vaccine against C. trachomatis infection has yet been developed. A significant impediment to vaccine development has been that the hosts' own immune responses contribute to pathogenesis of infection. Pathologies arise from persistent inflammation rather than from intrinsic destructiveness of the Chlamydia organism. Some anti-Chlamydia antibodies actively exacerbate infection, promoting its spread by enhancing \"parasite specific endocytosis.\" [0006] The molecular mechanisms of immunity to C. trachomatis remain elusive. In humans, immunity provided by prior infection is generally incomplete, short-lived and specific to one of 18 different serovars of C. trachomatis. Because Chlamydia live and reproduce inside a host cell as RBs, host immune responses mediated by blood-borne antibodies cannot clear infections. Some antibodies are \"neutralizing\" in vitro, in that they prevent the spread of infectious EBs in cell culture experiments. However, standing alone, these \"neutralizing\" antibodies are not sufficient to impart protective immunity. For example, most people suffering from chronic C. trachomatis genital infection have high levels of aaή-Chlamydia IgG which are \"neutralizing\" in vitro. (Stephens, Richard S., Introduction, pp xi-xxii, and Schachter, Julius, Chapter 6, \"Infection and Disease Epidemiology,\" pp 139-169, and Brunham, Robert, Chapter 8, \"Human Immunity to Chlamydiae,\" pp 211-238, in Chlamydia: Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis and Immunity, Stephens, Richard S., ed., ASM Press, Washington, DC, 1999).\n\n\n[0007] Furthermore, \"neutralizing\" antibodies are completely unnecessary for protective immunity in some animal models. Protective immunity in vivo against C. trachomatis appears primarily due to cellular immune responses. While some anti-Chlamydia antibodies actively exacerbate infection, antibodies generated against known protective antigens contribute to protective immunity by contributing to immune memory and optimum cellular immune response. Therefore, an effective vaccine antigen will promote a cellular immune response as well as a humoral immune response that contributes to cross-strain or genus-specific protective immunity. Id.\n\n\n[0008] High levels of antibodies that were \"neutralizing\" in vitro were produced in response to immunization with one promising, genetically engineered antigen. This recombinant, chimeric polypeptide was derived from known epitopes of the immunodominant C. trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP). A known T-helper epitope (directing a cellular immune response) was combined with known B-cell epitopes (directing a humoral immune response). \n\n Suφrisingly, this highly immunogenic, \"neutralizing\" antigen failed to impart protective immunity in vivo. (Su, eϊ al, Vaccine, 13(l l):1023-1032, 1995). A similar situation was observed with a cysteine-rich, 61 kDa C. trachomatis outer membrane protein. The cysteine-rich 6IkD protein was highly immunogenic, but failed to impart protective immunity in vivo. (Bowie, et al, Chlamydial infections: proceedings of the Seventh International Symposium on Human Chlamydial Infections, British Columbia, Canada, 24-19 June 1990, pp 265-268, Cambridge University Press).\n\n\n[0009] The HtrA (high temperature requirement) serine protease is an important heat-shock inducible protein. It acts both as a molecular chaperone under normal conditions, facilitating proper folding of cellular proteins, and also as protease under conditions of heat stress, digesting improperly folded proteins. HtrAs generally have a broad substrate specificity, recognizing cleavage sites from solvent-protected regions of proteins that would not normally be exposed at the protein surface. Given its conservation across serovars, HtrA offers the prospect of a useful vaccine that can induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses that will be broadly protective against C. trachomatis infection.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0010] The present invention includes isolated polynucleotides which encode Chlamydia HtrA polypeptides, including, for instance, isolated polynucleotides which encode C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptides.

Examples of suitable Chlamydia species include, but are not limited to, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pecorum, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. For instance, the present invention discloses that, while not identified as a \"neutralizing\" antigen in vitro, isolated recombinant HtrA polypeptides or polynucleotides encoded by the polypeptides from C. trachomatis induce a \n\n cellular immune response and impart protective immunity in vivo. Additional C. trachomatis or C. pneumonaie HtrA sequences are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/940,327, filed May 25, 2008 and International Application No. PCT/US2008/006656, filed May 23, 2008, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. .\n\n\n[0052] Methods of making and using the present invention include all conventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, immunology, and vaccination.

As such, the terms \"a\" (or \"an\"), \"one or more,\" and \"at least one\" can be used interchangeably herein. [0055] The terms \"nucleic acid\" or \"nucleic acid fragment\" refers to any one or more nucleic acid segments, e.g., DNA or RNA fragments, present in a polynucleotide or construct. Two or more nucleic acids of the present invention can be present in a single polynucleotide construct, e.g., on a single plasmid, or in separate (non-identical) polynucleotide constructs, e.g., on separate plasmids. Furthermore, any nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment may encode a single polypeptide, e.g. , a single antigen, cytokine, or regulatory polypeptide, or may encode more than one polypeptide, e.g., a nucleic acid may encode two or more polypeptides. In addition, a nucleic acid may encode a regulatory element such as a promoter or a transcription terminator, or may encode a specialized element or motif of a polypeptide or protein, such as a secretory signal peptide or a functional domain.\n\n\n[0056] The term \"polynucleotide\" is intended to encompass a single nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment as well as plural nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments, and refers to an isolated molecule or construct, e.g., a virus genome (e.g., a non-infectious viral genome), messenger RNA (mRNA), plasmid DNA (pDNA), or derivatives of pDNA (e.g., minicircles as described in (Darquet, A-M et al, Gene Therapy 4:1341-1349 (1997)) comprising a polynucleotide. A polynucleotide may be provided in linear (e.g., mRNA), circular (e.g., plasmid), or branched form as well as double-stranded or single-stranded forms. A polynucleotide may comprise a conventional phosphodiester bond or a non-conventional bond (e.g., an amide bond, such as found in peptide nucleic acids (PNA)).\n\n\n[0057] As used herein, the term \"polypeptide\" is intended to encompass a singular \"polypeptide\" as well as plural \"polypeptides,\" and comprises any chain or chains of two or more amino acids. Thus, as used herein, terms including, but not limited to \"peptide,\" \"dipeptide,\" \"tripeptide,\" \"protein,\" \"amino acid chain,\" or any other term used to refer to a chain or chains of two or more amino acids, are included in the definition of a \"polypeptide,\" and the term \n\n \"polypeptide\" may be used instead of, or interchangeably with any of these terms. The term further includes polypeptides which have undergone post-translational modifications, for example, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, or modification by non-naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n[0058] The term \"C trachomatis HtrA polypeptide,\" as used herein, encompasses full length HtrA, serotypic, allelic, and other variants of full length HtrA, fragments of full length HtrA, serotypic, allelic, and other variants of fragments of full length HtrA, derivatives of full-length HtrA, derivatives of fragments of full-length HtrA, analogues of full-length HtrA, analogues of fragments of full-length HtrA, and chimeric and fusion polypeptides comprising full length HtrA or one or more fragments of full length HtrA.\n\n\n[0059] The terms \"fragment,\" \"analog,\" \"derivative,\" or \"variant\" when referring to Chlamydia polypeptides of the present invention include any polypeptides which retain at least some of the immunogenicity or antigenicity of the naturally-occurring proteins. Fragments of Chlamydia polypeptides of the present invention include proteolytic fragments, deletion fragments and in particular, fragments of Chlamydia polypeptides which exhibit increased solubility during expression, purification, and or administration to an animal. Fragments of Chlamydia polypeptides further include proteolytic fragments or deletion fragments which exhibit reduced pathogenicity when delivered to a subject. Polypeptide fragments further include any portion of the polypeptide which comprises an antigenic or immunogenic epitope of the native polypeptide, including linear as well as three-dimensional epitopes.\n\n\n[0060] An \"epitopic fragment\" of a polypeptide antigen is a portion of the antigen that contains an epitope. An \"epitopic fragment\" may, but need not, contain amino acid sequence in addition to one or more epitopes.\n\n\n[0061] The term \"variant,\" as used herein, refers to a polypeptide that differs from the recited polypeptide due to amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions, and/or modifications. Variants may occur naturally, such as a serotypic variant. The term \"serotypic variant\" is intended polypeptides or polynucleotides that are present in a different serotype of Chlamydia sp. of the present invention. The serotypic variants are naturally occurring variants, but it can also be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques. In the case of C. trachomatis, at least 18 different strains, or \"serotypic variants\" (serovars) have been identified. There exists a high degree of variation between strains in some genes, for example, the genes encoding C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide. \n\n [0062] Non-naturally occurring variants may be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques. In a preferred embodiment, variant polypeptides differ from an identified sequence by substitution, deletion or addition of five amino acids or fewer. Such variants may generally be identified by modifying a polypeptide sequence, and evaluating the antigenic properties of the modified polypeptide using, for example, the representative procedures described herein. [0063] Polypeptide variants preferably exhibit at least about 60-70%, for example 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.9% sequence identity with identified polypeptides. Variant polypeptides may comprise conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions. Derivatives of Chlamydia polypeptides of the present invention are polypeptides which have been altered so as to exhibit additional features not found on the native polypeptide. Examples include fusion proteins. An analog is another form of a Chlamydia polypeptide of the present invention. An example is a proprotein which can be activated by cleavage of the proprotein to produce an active mature polypeptide. [0064] Variants may also, or alternatively, contain other modifications, whereby, for example, a polypeptide may be conjugated or coupled, e.g., fused to a heterologous polypeptide, e.g., a signal (or leader) sequence at the N-terminal end of the protein which co-translationally or post- translationally directs transfer of the protein. The polypeptide may also be conjugated or produced coupled to a linker or other sequence for ease of synthesis, purification or identification of the polypeptide {e.g. , 6-His), or to enhance binding of the polypeptide to a solid support. For example, a polypeptide may be conjugated or coupled to an immunoglobulin Fc region. The polypeptide may also be conjugated or coupled to a sequence that imparts or modulates the immune response to the polypeptide (e.g. a T-cell epitope, B-cell epitope, cytokine, chemokine, etc.) and/or enhances uptake and/or processing of the polypeptide by antigen presenting cells or other immune system cells. The polypeptide may also be conjugated or coupled to other polypeptides/epitopes from Chlamydia sp. and/or from other bacteria and/or other viruses to generate a hybrid immunogenic protein that alone or in combination with various adjuvants can elicit protective immunity to other pathogenic organisms.\n\n\n[0065] The term \"integer\" as used herein refers to a number or numbers of either nucleic acids or amino acids. The term \"integer\" can be used to specify a range of nucleotide or peptide sequences. For example, polypeptides with at least 70 percent sequence identity to polypeptides consisting essentially of amino acids b-151 of SEQ ED NO:2, 6 or 8, wherein b is any integer between 1 and 141, can be any one of the following: amino acids 1-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 2-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 3-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino \n\n acids 4-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 5-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 6- 151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8;

When a position in one sequence is occupied by the same nucleic acid base or amino acid residue in the corresponding position of the comparator sequence, the sequences are said to be \"identical\" at that position. The percentage \"sequence identity\" is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of \"identical\" positions. The number of \"identical\" positions is then divided by the total number of positions in the comparison window and multiplied by 100 to yield the percentage of \"sequence identity.\" Percentage of \"sequence identity\" (i.e., \"percent identity\") is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window (e.g., SEQ K) NO:2 and a homologous polypeptide from another C. trachomatis isolate). In order to \n\n optimally align sequences for comparison, the portion of a polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions termed gaps while the reference sequence (e.g. SEQ ID NO:2) is kept constant. An optimal alignment is that alignment which, even with gaps, produces the greatest possible number of \"identical\" positions between the reference and comparator sequences. Percentage \"sequence identity\" between two sequences can be determined using the version of the program \"BLAST 2 Sequences\" which was available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information as of September 1, 2004, which program incorporates the programs BLASTN (for nucleotide sequence comparison) and BLASTP (for polypeptide sequence comparison), which programs are based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. USA 90(12):5873-5877, 1993). When utilizing \"BLAST 2 Sequences,\" parameters that were default parameters as of September 1 , 2004, can be used for word size (3), open gap penalty (11), extension gap penalty (1), gap dropoff (50), expect value (10), and any other required parameter including but not limited to matrix option. [0067] The term \"epitopes,\" as used herein, refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, for example a mammal, for example, a human. An \"immunogenic epitope,\" as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an immune response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art. The term \"antigenic epitope,\" as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody or T-cell receptor can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Whereas all immunogenic epitopes are antigenic, antigenic epitopes need not be immunogenic.\n\n\n[0068] As used herein, a \"coding region\" is a portion of nucleic acid which consists of codons translated into amino acids. Although a \"stop codon\" (TAG, TGA, or TAA) is not translated into an amino acid, it may be considered to be part of a coding region, but any flanking sequences, for example promoters, ribosome binding sites, transcriptional terminators, and the like, are outside the coding region.\n\n\n[0069] The term \"codon optimization\" is defined herein as modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the cells of the host of interest by replacing at least one, more than one, or a significant number, of codons of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that host. Various species exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid. \n\n [0070] The term \"pharmaceutical compositions\" comprise compositions containing immunogenic peptides of the invention which are administered to an individual already suffering from a Chlamydia infection or an individual in need of immunization against Chlamydia infection.\n\n\n[0071] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" refers to compositions that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity or other complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. In some embodiments, the polypeptide, polynucleotides, compositions, and vaccines of the present invention are pharmaceutically acceptable.\n\n\n[0072] An \"effective amount\" is that amount the administration of which to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or prevention. An amount is effective, for example, when its administration results in a reduced incidence of C. trachomatis in the lower genital tract relative to an untreated individual, as determined two weeks after challenge with infectious C. trachomatis. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated {e.g. human, nonhuman primate, primate, etc.), the responsive capacity of the individual's immune system, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, a professional assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the effective amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. Typically a single dose is from about 10 μg to 10 mg/kg body weight of purified polypeptide or an amount of a modified carrier organism or virus, or a fragment or remnant thereof, sufficient to provide a comparable quantity of recombinantly expressed HtrA polypeptide. The term \"peptide vaccine\" or \"subunit vaccine\" refers to a composition comprising one or more polypeptides of the present invention, which when administered to an animal are useful in stimulating an immune response against Chlamydia infection.\n\n\n[0073] The term \"subject\" is meant any subject, particularly a mammalian subject, for whom diagnosis, prognosis, immunization, or therapy is desired. Mammalian subjects include, but are not limited to, humans, domestic animals, farm animals, zoo animals such as bears, sport animals, pet animals such as dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, horses, cattle, bears, cows; primates such as apes, monkeys, orangutans, and chimpanzees; canids such as dogs and wolves; felids such as cats, lions, and tigers; equids such as horses, donkeys, and zebras; food animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep; ungulates such as deer and giraffes; rodents such as mice, \n\n rats, hamsters and guinea pigs; koalas, and so on. In certain embodiments, the animal is a human subject.\n\n\n[0074] The term \"animal\" is intended to encompass a singular \"animal\" as well as plural \"animals\" and comprises mammals and birds, as well as fish, reptiles, and amphibians. The term animal also encompasses model animals, e.g., disease model animals. In some embodiments, the term animal includes valuable animals, either economically or otherwise, e.g., economically important breeding stock, racing animals, show animals, heirloom animals, rare or endangered animals, or companion animals. In particular, the mammal can be a human subject, a food animal or a companion animal.\n\n\n[0075] As used herein, an \"subject in need thereof refers to an individual for whom it is desirable to treat, i.e., to prevent, cure, retard, or reduce the severity of Chlamydia disease symptoms, and/or result in no worsening of Chlamydia disease over a specified period of time. [0076] The terms \"priming\" or \"primary\" and \"boost\" or \"boosting\" as used herein to refer to the initial and subsequent immunizations, respectively, i.e., in accordance with the definitions these terms normally have in immunology. However, in certain embodiments, e.g., where the priming component and boosting component are in a single formulation, initial and subsequent immunizations may not be necessary as both the \"prime\" and the \"boost\" compositions are administered simultaneously.\n\n\n[0077] The term \"passive immunity\" refers to the immunity to an antigen developed by a host animal, the host animal being given antibodies produced by another animal, rather than producing its own antibodies to the antigen. The term \"active immunity\" refers to the production of an antibody by a host animal as a result of the presence of the target antigen.\n\n\nPolynucleotides\n\n\n[0078] The present invention includes a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid encoding a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide that does not exhibit a high degree of homology to a eukaryotic protein, hi one embodiment of the invention, the polynucleotide does not hybridize under moderate stringency conditions to a eukaryotic polynucleotide. In one embodiment of the invention, the polynucleotide does not hybridize under high stringency conditions to a eukaryotic polynucleotide. In one embodiment, the eukaryotic polynucleotide is a mammalian polynucleotide. In one embodiment, the eukaryotic or mammalian polynucleotide comprises at least about at least about 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 or more nucleotides in length. \n\n [0079] In another embodiment, the polypeptide comprises a polypeptide with at least 70 percent identity to a nucleic acid encoding amino acids 1-169 or 1-151 of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6 or 8 or a polypeptide fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the polypeptide consists essentially of a polypeptide with at least 70 percent identity to a nucleic acid encoding amino 1-169 or 1-151 of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6 or 8 or a polypeptide fragment thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide fragment is an immunogenic fragment.\n\n\n[0080] The polynucleotide of the invention may encode a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide fragment, analog, derivative, or variant thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide or fragment, analog, derivative or variant thereof is a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide or fragment, analog, derivative or variant thereof. In another embodiment, the Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide or fragment, analog, derivative or variant thereof is a C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptide or fragment, analog, derivative or variant thereof. [0081] Polynucleotide sequences encoding Chlamydia HtrA polypeptides may be cloned from genomic DNA from any suitable Chlamydia strain (e.g., C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae strain) by a variety of techniques known in the art. For instance, C. trachomatis can be cultured as an infected-cell culture as described in McClenaghan, et al, Infect. Immun. 45(2):384-389, 1984. Chlamydia genomic DNA can be isolated, for example, as described in Peeling, et al., Infect. Immun., 46(2):484-488, 1984. Full length HtrA genes may be cloned, for example, by PCR amplification. Suitable primers are described herein, or may be designed using techniques well known in the art. An oligonucleotide forward primer, encoding a known N-terminal sequence of Chlamydia HtrA, may be used together with an oligonucleotide reverse primer, which comprises the reverse complement of a known C-terminal sequence. Suitable primers may include a synthetic restriction enzyme cleavage site which is not found within the Chlamydia HtrA coding sequence, to facilitate manipulation of the PCR amplification clone. Suitable C. trachomatis forward primers include SEQ ID NO: 9, which includes a synthetic Ncol restriction site. Suitable reverse primers include SEQ ID NO: 10, which includes a synthetic Sail restriction site. Other suitable primers can be readily identified by one skilled in the art based on SEQ ED NO:1 (C. trachomatis HtrA gene from serovar L\n2\n), SEQ ID NO: 5 (a corresponding serotypic variant from serovar D) and SEQ ID NO:7 (a corresponding serotypic variant from serovar MoPn). Alternatively, degenerate primers may be designed which permit amplification of corresponding genes despite a high degree of sequence variability. PCR conditions can also be modified to allow for a greater degree of sequence similarity, as is well known to those skilled in the art. \n\n [0082] Alternatively, polynucleotide sequences encoding Chlamydia HtrA polypeptides, for instance, C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides, may be obtained by screening an appropriate Chlamydia genomic library, for instance, C. trachomatis genomic library, using oligonucleotide or other polynucleotide probe sequences that encode portions of the HtrA amino acid sequence, or that represent complements of such coding sequences. Techniques to prepare genomic libraries are well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. In the preparation of genomic libraries, DNA fragments are generated, some of which encode all or part of an HtrA polypeptide. To generate these fragments, genomic DNA can be cleaved, or partially cleaved, using specific restriction enzymes. Alternatively, DNAse in the presence of manganese may be used to fragment genomic DNA, or the DNA can be physically sheared, for example, by sonifϊcation. The genomic DNA fragments can then be separated according to size by standard techniques, including but not limited to, agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, column chromatography, or sucrose gradient centrifugation. The genomic DNA fragments can then be inserted into suitable vectors, including but not limited to, plasmids, cosmids, bacteriophages lambda or T4, or yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC). The genomic library can then be screened by hybridization.\n\n\n[0083] Alternatively, polynucleotide sequences encoding HtrA polypeptides may be obtained by screening an appropriate Chlamydia expression library. Techniques for preparation of expression libraries are well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, DNA encoding polypeptides that are actually expressed is reverse transcribed from isolated C. trachomatis rnRNA. These cDNAs are then isolated and ligated into an expression vector so that the inserted coding sequence will be expressed by a host cell into which the vector is introduced. Various screening assays can then be used to select for host cells expressing HtrA polypeptide. For example, antibodies raised against C. trachomatis HtrA can be used to identify desired clones using methods well known in the art. A cDNA sequence encoding HtrA can then be isolated from an identified expression clone.\n\n\n[0084] Clones encoding C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptides can be checked for completeness of coding sequence by a variety of techniques known in the art. For example, the cloned insert can be sequenced and its deduced, translated amino acid sequence compared with known sequences of full-length HtrAs is shown in SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6 or 8. Where the isolated clone appears to be only partial, complete clones may be isolated using the insert of the partial clone as a hybridization probe for further screening. Alternatively, a complete coding sequence can be reconstructed using contig assembly of overlapping partial clones, splicing \n\n overlapping partial clones with appropriate restriction enzymes at suitable shared restriction sites, and ligating the spliced inserts together.\n\n\n[0085] Included within the scope of the invention are polynucleotides comprising at least about 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity to polynucleotides encoding C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptides, fragments, derivatives, or variants thereof. Variants commonly occur with many genes of simple, unicellular organisms. Examples of variants are serotypic variants. Another example of variants can be found within strains. For example, even within strains, different isolates obtained from different patients and/or geographical locations can exhibit some variation. Coding nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of outer membrane proteins can have as little as 60% sequence identity, between strains of C. trachomatis. (Yuan, et al, Infect. Immun., 57(4):1040-1049, 1989; Moroni, et al., Arch Microbiol, 165:164-168, 1996; Gomes, et al, J. Bacteriol, 186(13):4295-4306, 2004; Millman, et al, J. Bacteriol, 186(8):2457-2465, 2004). [0086] The sequences of genes encoding C. trachomatis HtrA are known from three different serovars. The nucleotide sequence from the L\n2\n serovar is disclosed here as SEQ ID NO:1. SEQ ID NO:2 is the amino acid sequence of C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide L\n2\n serovar. Also known are serotypic variants from the D (Stephens, et al, Science, 282(5389):754-9, 1998) and MoPn (Read, et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 28(6): 1397-406, 2000) serovars, disclosed here as SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:7, respectively. The corresponding translated polypeptide sequences from the L\n2\n, D and MoPn serovars are given respectively by SEQ ED NO:2, SEQ ID NO:6 and SEQ ID NO: 8. As shown in Table 1, polynucleotide sequence identities of C. trachomatis HtrA genes vary by more than 17% between serovars while amino acid sequence identities vary by more than 7%. See also Figures 2 and 3.\n\n\nTABLE 1. Serotypic variation of C. trachomatis HtrA genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0087] Serotypic variation of HtrA is much lower than that observed with MOMP. Serotypic variants are therefore expected to be immunologically cross-reactive. The present invention thus \n\n includes HtrA polypeptides found in other Chlamydia sp, e.g., C. trachomatis serotypes such as, but not limited to, A, B, Ba, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, Li, L\n2\n, L\n3\n, MoPn, or Chlamydia pneumoniae or fragments thereof. These proteins can be obtained using the methods described above or available to a person of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n[0088] For instance, the polypeptide sequences of C. pneumoniae are publically available. Exemplary C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptide sequences are provided in the Table 2. C pneumoniae HtrA polypeptides can be modified by the methods disclosed herein, for instance, to reduce protease activity.\n\n\nTABLE 2. C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptide sequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0089] The present invention is directed to the polynucleotide encoding portions of full-length or mature HtrA polypeptides, analogs, variants, as well as fragments thereof described herein. Full-length HtrA consists of a signal sequence, a catalytic domain (serine protease domain), PDZ 1 domain, and PDZ 2 domain, hi one embodiment, the polynucleotide of the invention encodes a polyptide containing a signal sequence and an N-terminus portion of the serine protease domain but no PDZ 1 or 2 domains. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide of the invention encodes a HtrA polypeptide containing an N-terminus portion of the serine protease domain but no signal sequence or PDZ 1 or 2 domains. Mature HtrA is the full-length HtrA without a signal sequence. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, the beginning and ending residues of the domains may vary depending upon the computer modeling program used or the method used for determining the domains.\n\n\n[0090] Three structural domains of C. trachomatis HtrA comprising the conserved regions can thus be identified - a solvent-protected serine protease domain and two highly solvent accessible PDZ interaction domains. Examples of predicted domains of SEQ ID NO:2 are shown in Table 3. \n\n TABLE 3. C. trachomatis HtrA Domains (SEQ ID N0s:2, 4, 6, and 8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0091] The signal sequence can be deduced to be, e.g., about either amino acids 1-21 or about 1-16 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8 or intermediate fragments; the serine protease domain can be deduced to be, e.g., about amino acids 128-288 or about amino acids 95-297 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8 or intermediate fragments; PDZ 1 domain can be either about amino acids 300-379 or about amino acids 290-389 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8 or intermediate fragments; and PDZ 2 domain can be about either amino acids 428-483 or about amino acids 394-493 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8 or intermediate fragments. Similar domains may be identified for the HtrA of C. pneumoniae (SEQ ID NOs:31, 33, 35, and 37).\n\n\n[0092] The present invention includes a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to a reference amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids a-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids b-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 1-c of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids a-c of SEQ ID NO:2; and amino acids b-c of SEQ ID NO:2; wherein a is any integer between 1 and 169, b is any integer between 1 and 141, and c is any integer between 10 and 169.

In other embodiments, the present invention is directed to the polynucleotides encoding the HtrA polypeptides, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof, which lack a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids d-497 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids e-497 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 171-f of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 152-g of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids d-f of SEQ ID NO:6; and amino acids e-g of SEQ ID NO:6, wherein d is any integer between 171 and 490, e is any integer between 152 and 490, f is any integer between 181 and 497, and g is any integer between 162 and 497.\n\n\n[0094] In yet further embodiments, the invention includes a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to a reference amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids a-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids b-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 1-c of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids a-c of SEQ ID NO:8; and amino acids b-c of SEQ ID NO:8; wherein a is any integer between 1 and 169, b is any integer between 1 and 141, and c is any integer between 10 and 169. In other embodiments, the present invention is directed to the polynucleotides encoding the HtrA polypeptides, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof, which lack a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids d-497 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids e-497 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 171-f of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 152-g of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids d-f of SEQ ID NO:8; and amino acids e-g of SEQ ID NO:8, wherein d is any integer between 171 and 490, e is any integer between 152 and 490, f is any integer between 181 and 497, and g is any integer between 162 and 497.\n\n\n[0095] In certain other embodiments, the present invention includes a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a nucleic acid sequence at least 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to a reference nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids 22-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 20-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 17-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 22-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 20-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 17-169 of SEQ BD NO:2; amino acids 152-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 145-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 145-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 128-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino \n\n acids 128-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 113-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 113-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 110-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 110-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 80-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 80-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 69-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 69-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 95-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; and amino acids 95-169 of SEQ ID NO:2.

In other embodiments, the present invention is directed to the polynucleotides encoding the HtrA polypeptides, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof, which lack a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: 152-497 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 170-497 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 152-g of SEQ ID NO:6; and amino acids 170-f of SEQ ID NO:6, wherein f is any integer between 181 and 497, and g is any integer between 162 and 497.\n\n\n[0097] In certain other embodiments, the present invention includes a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a nucleic acid sequence at least 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to a reference nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids 22-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 20-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 17-151 of SEQ ID \n\n NO:8; amino acids 22-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 20-169 of SEQ E) NO:8; amino acids 17-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 152-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 145-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 145-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 128-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 128-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 113-151 of SEQ ED NO:8; amino acids 113-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 110-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 110-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 80-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 80-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 69-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 69-169 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 95-151 of SEQ ID NO:8; and amino acids 95-169 of SEQ ID NO:8. In other embodiments, the present invention is directed to the polynucleotides encoding the HtrA polypeptides, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof, which lack a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: 152-497 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 170-497 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 152-g of SEQ E) NO:8; and amino acids 170-f of SEQ E) NO:8, wherein f is any integer between 181 and 497, and g is any integer between 162 and 497.\n\n\n[0098] In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ E) NO:1 or fragment thereof, which encodes the polypeptide sequences of the present invention. For example, the nucleotide sequence can be residues Y\n1\n -507 of SEQ E) NO: 1 , wherein Yi is an integer between 49 and 64.\n\n\n[0099] Alternatively, the domains of HtrA can be determined by comparing the C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide sequence or C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptide sequence to E. coli HtrA polypeptide sequence. In crystal structures, E. coli HtrA monomers have three distinct structural domains - a serine protease domain (about residues 17-259), and two PDZ protein-protein interaction domains (about residues 260-358 and 359-448). See Figure 1. In E. coli, mouse and human HtrAs, these PDZ interaction domains provide broad substrate specificity, which is required for recognition of misfolded proteins. (Murwantoko, M., et al, Biochem. J, 381:895- 904, 2004; Spiers, A., et al, J. Biological Chem., 277(42):39443-39449, 2002; Martins, L., et al., J. Biological Chem., 278(49):49417-49427, 2003). In crystal structures, E. coli HtrA forms hexamers. (Krojer, T., et al., Nature, 416:455-459, 2002). In these hexameric oligomers, HtrA serine protease domains are entirely shielded from solvent. In contrast, the PDZ domains are entirely solvent-exposed in monomers as well as hexamers. (Krojer, T., et al, Nature, 416:455- 459, 2002).\n\n\n[0100] The portion of C. trachomatis HtrA comprising about residues 127-497 has about 63% sequence identity with E. coli HtrA residues 114-474, as revealed by BLAST 2 SEQUENCES comparison using default parameters. A BLASTP comparison of C. trachomatis HtrA (SEQ E) \n\n NO:2) against the SWISSPROT protein sequence database identifies a conserved trypsin-like catalytic domain (residues 135-273) along with two PDZ protein-protein interaction/recognition domains (residues 300-392 and 406-492). A conserved domain map of C. trachomatis HtrA is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n[0101] The portion of C. trachomatis HtrA comprising about residues 170 to 497, which is assumed to constitute the proteins C-terminus, shares significant amino acid sequence identity with eukayrotic proteins including human proteins. The existence of such presumed orthologs in humans makes it likely that this region of the HtrA protein will be unsuitable for use as a human vaccine. However the portion of C. trachomatis HtrA comprising about residues 1-169, the presumed N-terminus of the protein, has limited or no homology with eukaryotic proteins. Accordingly, this segment of HtrA may be suitable for uses as a vaccine antigen in humans. [0102] Additional HtrA fragments of the present invention can be identified using a protease, e.g. cathepsin S. As shown in Table 4, Cathepsin S cleavage sites (Carmicle, S., et al, J. Biol. Chem., 227(l):155-160, 2002; Bromme, D., et al, Biochem J, 264(2):475-81, 1989; Pluger, E., et al., Eur. J. Immunol, 32:467-476, 2002) were identified in each of the three domains of C. trachomatis HtrA. Cathepsin S, a cysteine endoprotease, is expressed uniquely in antigen presenting cells and plays an important, and often critical, role in MHC Class II antigen processing. (Watts, C, Nature Immun., 5(7):685-692, 2004; Bromme, D., et al, Biochem J, 264(2):475-81, 1989; Pluger, E., et al, Eur. J. Immunol, 32:467-476, 2002). Initial proteolytic degradation of MHC Class II antigens is directed at solvent-exposed sites in the substrate protein, at linker regions between domains and at regions of structural disorder. (Carmicle, S., et al, J. Biol. Chem., 227(l):155-160, 2002; Novotny, J., et al, FEBS Lett., 211(2):185-9, 1987). Six Cathepsin S sites were identified in all. Sites 1, 2, 3 and 4 are within the solvent protected serine protease domain, i.e., about amino acids 17-299 of SEQ ID NO:2. Site 5 is within the first solvent-exposed PDZ domain, i.e., about amino acids 300-392 of SEQ ID NO:2. Site 6 is within the second solvent-exposed PDZ domain, i.e., about amino acids 393-497 of SEQ ID NO:2. Table 4 shows Cathepsin S cleavage sites in C. trachomatis HtrA. Each cleavage site is identified by number, underlined, and expressed in bold face. Domain boundaries are also identified. The fragments that are produced by Cathepsin S include: amino acids 1-19; amino acids 20-497; amino acids 1-79; amino acids 80-497; amino acids 1-112; and amino acids 113- 497; amino acids 1-187; amino acids 188-497; amino acids 1-326; amino acids 327-497; amino acids 1-436; or amino acids 437-497 of SEQ ED NOs:2, 6, or 8. \n\n TABLE 4.\n\n\nCathepsin S cleavage sites in C. trachomatis HtrA\n\n\n[Serine protease domain (residues 1-299)]:\n\n\nMVKRLLCVLLSTSVFSSPML\n1\nGYSASKKDSKADICLAVSSGDOEVSQEDLL\n\n\nKEVSRGFSRVAAKATPGVVYIENFPKTGN^AIASPGNKRGFQENPFDYFN\n\n\nDEFFNRFFGLPSH\n3\nREQORPQORDAVRGTGFIVSEDGYVVTNHHVVEDAG KIHVTLHDGQKYTAKIVGLDPKTDLAVIKIOAEKLPFLT\n4\nFGNSDOLQIGD\n\n\nWALAIGNPFGLQATVTVGVVSAKGRNQLHIVDFEDFIQTDAAINPGNSGG PLLNINGQVIGVNTAIVSGSGGYIGIGFAIPSLMAKRVIDQLISDGQVTR\n\n\n[First PDZ protein-protein interaction domain (residues 300-392)]:\n\n\nGFLGVTLQPIDSELATCYKLEKVYGALV\n5\nTDVVKGSPAEKAGLROEDVIVA YNGKEVESLSALRNAISLMMPGTRVILKIVREGKTIEIPVTVT\n\n\n[Second conserved PDZ protein-protein interaction domain (residues 393-497)]:\n\n\nQIPTEDGVSALQKMGVRVONITPEICKKLGLAADTRGILVVAVEA\n6\nGSPAA\n\n\nSAGVAPGQLILAVNRQRVASVEELNQVLKNSKGENVLLMVSQGDVVRFΓV\n\n\nLKSDE\n\n\n[0103] Three regions that contain CD4(+) ThI cell epitopes can thus be identified:\n\n\n(1) The solvent-exposed C-terminal region, beginning from Cathepsin site 5.

Amino acids 437-497 of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO: 19, has about 100% or about 89% sequence identity with the corresponding portions of HtrA from C. trachomatis serovars D or MoPn, respectively. Amino acids 327-436 of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:20, has about 94% or about 91% sequence identity with the corresponding portions of HtrA from C. trachomatis serovars D or MoPn, respectively. \n\n [0105] The invention further provides any combinations of fragments produced by Cathepsin S cleavage sites shown in Table 4. For example, the present invention is directed to a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to amino acids 1-19, amino acids 1-79, amino acids 1-112, amino acids 20-79, amino acids 20-112, and amino acids 80-112, of SEQ ID NO:2 or two or more such amino acid sequences in combination, provided that the amino acid sequence is not SEQ ID NOs:6, or 8, wherein the polypeptide when administered to a subject in need thereof in a sufficient amount, induces an immune response against Chlamydia sp.\n\n\n[0106] Auto-catalytic fragments of full-length HtrA which comprise B cell epitopes were observed experimentally. HtrA is well known to catalyze auto-digestion. (Krojer, T., et al, Nature, 416:455-459, 2002; Hu, S., et al, J. Biol. Chem., 273(51):34406-12, 1998; Gray, C, et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 267(18):5699-710, 2000; Clausen, T., et al, MoI Cell, 10(3):443-55, 2002). As shown in Figure 4(D), in a Western Blot of purified C. trachomatis HtrA immunostained with a polyclonal rabbit anti-serum (K306) raised against purified C. pneumoniae HtrA, several bands are apparent in addition to the principal band. These additional bands are autocatalytic fragments of full-length HtrA and react with antibody K306. [0107] The predominant band in Figure 4(D), migrating with apparent molecular weight of approximately 52 kD, corresponds to full length mature HtrA, which has a calculated molecular weight 53,209 daltons. Additional, strong immunostaining bands are observed with apparent molecular weights of approximately 47 kD and 40 kD along with faint bands of lower molecular weight, approximately 30 kD and 16 kD. These immunoreactive auto-catalytic fragments of C. trachomatis HtrA shown in Table 5 are quite similar to those observed with human HtrA. [0108] HtrA typically cleaves at Valine-Valine (\"VV\"), Isoleucine- Valine (\"IV\") or Leucine- Valine (\"LV\") sites within an interior, solvent protected region. (Kolmar, H., et al, J. Bacteriol, 178(2):5925-5929, 1996; Jones, C, et al, J. Bacteriol, 184(20):5762-5771, 2002). As shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7, the observed apparent molecular weight of the additional immunoreactive bands in Figure 4(D) corresponds to the expected molecular weight of immunoreactive auto- digestion fragments. HtrA auto-digestion is expected to proceed primarily against the solvent- protected serine protease domain comprising the N-terminal portion of the molecule. The C- terminal portion of the molecule, comprising highly solvent-exposed PDZ protein-protein interaction domains, is expected to contain B-cell epitopes. Table 5 shows auto-cleavage sites in C. trachomatis HtrA. Each site is underlined, bold-faced, and identified by number. Domain \n\n boundaries are also identified. Table 7 shows the correlation between observed apparent molecular weight of immunoreactive fragments and the expected molecular weight of an immunoreactive C-terminal fragment from which were used to identify the auto-catalytic fragments.

As used herein, the term \"isolated\" means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof has been removed from other biological materials with which it is naturally associated. An example of an isolated polynucleotide is a recombinant polynucleotide contained in a vector. Further examples of an isolated polynucleotide include recombinant polynucleotides maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) polynucleotides in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the polynucleotides of the present invention. Isolated polynucleotides or nucleic acids according to the present invention further include such molecules produced synthetically. [0115] As used herein, the term \"substantially purified\" means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof is substantially free of other biological material with which it is naturally associated, or free from other biological materials derived, e.g., from a recombinant host cell that has been genetically engineered to express the polypeptide of the invention. For example, a purified polypeptide of the present invention includes a polypeptide that is at least about 70-100% pure, i.e., a polypeptide which is present in a composition wherein the polypeptide constitutes about 70-100% by weight of the total composition. In some embodiments, the purified polypeptide of the present invention is about 75%-99% by weight pure, about 80%-99% by weight pure, about 90-99% by weight pure, or about 95% to 99% by weight pure. An example of an isolated polynucleotide is a recombinant polynucleotide contained in a vector. Further examples of an isolated polynucleotide include recombinant polynucleotides maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) polynucleotides in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the polynucleotides of the present invention. Isolated polynucleotides or \n\n nucleic acids according to the present invention further include such molecules produced synthetically. The relative degree of purity of a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention is easily determined by well-known methods.\n\n\n[0116] Further included is an isolated polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence with at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to amino acids 1-51 or 1-169 of SEQ ID NO:2 or fragments thereof, wherein the amino acid sequence has a reduced or decreased catalytic activity. The term \"catalytic activity\" described herein is defined as a proteolytic activity, i.e. ability to degrade membrane or periplasmic proteins, as well as ability to degrade itself. The substrate for the proteolytic activity can be any proteins found in an organism, membrane-associated or periplasmic proteins, and includes autocatalytic activity. The term \"a reduced or decreased catalytic activity\" further includes, for instance, C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptides that exhibit a reduced or decreased substrate binding compared to its naturally-occurring polypeptide. Such polynucleotides encoding a C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptide, or fragments, analogs, derivatives, or variants thereof with a reduced or decreased catalytic activity can be readily predicted or identified by a person of ordinary skill in the art using routine assays, as shown in Figure 4(B). The polynucleotides with an ablated or reduced protease activity can be readily produced by an ordinary skilled person in the art using conventional technologies, e.g., site directed mutagenesis. For example, one or more amino acids in the catalytic domain, as shown in Table 3, can be substituted, replaced, modified, or deleted to ablate or reduce the catalytic activity of the HtrA polypeptide while the polypeptide retains immunogenicity or antigenicity.\n\n\n[0117] In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8, variants, derivatives, analogs, or fragments thereof, encoded by the polynucleotide of the present invention, can be substituted, replaced, modified, or deleted with one or more of amino acids at one or more amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of residue 105 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8; residue 137 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8; residue 143 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8; and residue 155 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8. The polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the amino acid sequence retains immunogenicity or antigenicity after the substitution, replacement, modification, or deletion.\n\n\n[0118] Technologies that are used to construct protease ablated/reduced HtrA polypeptide is readily available in the art. For example, it is well known in the art that many trypsin-like serine proteases contain a consensus sequence Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly-Gly-Pro-Lys. Johnson, et al., MoI. \n\n Microbiol. 5:410-7 (1991). Likewise, a similar consensus sequence, Gly-Asn-Ser-Gly-Gly, is found at amino acids 208-212 of the E. coli full-length HtrA polypeptide. (Skorko-Glonek, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 270: 11140-11146 (1995)), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The particular consensus sequence is known to play an important role in the catalytic activity of the HtrA polypeptides. In particular, the E. coli HtrA polypeptide variant in which serine at residue 210 is substituted with alanine shows complete lack of catalytic activity. Id. A similar mutant in which histidine at residue 105 was substituted with arginine also showed reduced catalytic activity. Id. Therefore, a person of ordinary skill in the art can, for example, calculate the residues in the C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide corresponding to S\n210\n or H\n105\n of the E. coli HtrA mature polypeptides. The same consensus sequence found in the E. coli HtrA polypeptide is found in the C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides at amino acids 245-249 of SEQ E) NO:2 for C. trachomatis serotype L\n2\n. The corresponding residues in SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, and 8 to S\n210\n and H\n105\n in E.coli HtrA are S\n247\n and H\n143\n.\n\n\n[0119] The present invention thus includes a polynucleotide which encodes a C. trachomatis polypeptide, fragment, derivative, analog, or variant thereof, which has an amino acid at 143 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, or 8 other than serine or histidine, respectively. For example, the amino acid at 247 of SEQ ED NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8 or any fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof can be alanine, and the amino acid at 143 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, or 8 or any fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof can be arginine. Similarly, the present invention includes a C. trachomatis polynucleotide which encodes an HtrA polypeptide, which may be resistant to auto- cleavage activity. A person of ordinary skill in the art can readily make such modifications or substitutions to make the polypeptides with or without a specific activity. One skilled in the art can test the protease activity as shown in Figure 4(B).\n\n\n[0120] The present invention also includes a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to the HtrA polypeptide sequence or fragment thereof without a part of or whole catalytic domain, wherein the polynucleotide has no or reduced catalytic activity. The catalytic domain, shown in Table 3, can have one or more amino acid deletions that give rise to no catalytic activity or a reduced activity. [0121] In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a polynucleotide further comprising a heterologous nucleic acid. The heterologous nucleic acid can, in some embodiments, encode a heterologous polypeptide fused to the polypeptide. The term \"heterologous\" refers to any additional biological components that are not identical with the \n\n subject biological component. The components may be host cells, genes, or regulatory regions, such as promoters. The heterologous components can function together, as when a promoter heterologous to a gene is operably linked to the gene. Another example is where a chlamydial sequence is heterologous to a mouse host cell. A further example would be two epitopes from the same or different proteins which have been assembled in a single protein. An example includes a polynucleotide which encodes an Fc portion of an antibody linked to a fragment of a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide of the invention. Another example is a full-length or mature HtrA polypeptide fused to a 6 histidine tag, i.e., SEQ ID NO:4. The present invention includes a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid which encodes an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or 100% identical to amino acids 1 to 151 or amino acids 1 to 169 of SEQ ED NO:2 or a fragment thereof without a signal sequence and a heterologous polypeptide, e.g., SEQ ID NO:4, wherein said polypeptide when administered to a subject in need thereof in a sufficient amount, induces an immune response against Chlamydia sp. [0122] Various heterologous nucleic acids can be used to encode their respective heterologous polypeptides. In some embodiments, the heterologous polypeptide is fused to the polypeptide of the present invention. Various heterologous polypeptides can be used, and can be selected from the group consisting of an N- or C-terminal peptide imparting stabilization, secretion, or simplified purification, i.e., His-tag (SEQ ID NO:4), ubiquitin tag, NusA tag, chitin binding domain, ompT, ompA, pelB, DsbA, DsbC, c-myc, KSI, polyaspartic acid, (Ala-Trp-Trp-Pro)n (SEQ ID NO: 10), polyphenyalanine, polycysteine, polyarginine, B-tag, HSB-tag, green fluorescent protein (GFP), hemagglutinin influenza virus (HAI), calmodulin binding protein (CBP), galactose-binding protein, maltose binding protein (MBP), cellulose binding domains (CBD's), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), streptococcal protein G, staphylococcal protein A, T7genelO, avidin/streptavidin/Strep-tag, trpE, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, lacZ (β-Galactosidase), His-patch thioredoxin, thioredoxin, FLAG™ peptide (Sigma-Aldrich), S-tag, and T7-tag. See e.g., Stevens, R.C., Structure, 8:R177-R185 (2000). The heterologous polypeptides can further include any pre- and/or pro- sequences that facilitate the transport, translocations, processing and/or purification of C. trachomatis HtrA vaccine antigens from a host cell or any useful immunogenic sequence, including but not limited to sequences that encode a T-cell epitope of a microbial pathogen, or other immunogenic proteins and/or epitopes. In one embodiment of the invention, the heterologous peptide is a chemokine or cytokine, including, but not limited to, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, IL- 4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-I l, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17 or IL-18. \n\n [0123] Other suitable heterologous polypeptides may include other Chlamydia proteins (either native proteins or variants, fragments, or derivatives thereof, e.g., MOMP, PorB, Pmp6, Pmp8, Pmpl l , Pmp20, Pmp21, PmpD, PmpE, PmpG, PmpH, Pmpl, OmpH, 0mp4, 0mp5, Omp85, MIP, OmcA, and OmcB), and in some embodiments, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium. In some embodiments, the polypeptide of the present invention can exist as a homopolymer, comprising multiple copies of the same polypeptide. Codon Optimization\n\n\n[0124] Also included within the scope of the invention are genetically engineered polynucleotides encoding C. trachomatis HtrA variants. Modifications of nucleic acids encoding HtrA polypeptides can readily be accomplished by those skilled in the art, for example, by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis of a polynucleotide coding for an HtrA polypeptide. Such modified polypeptide can be encoded by a codon optimized nucleotide sequence. Such modifications impart one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions, deletions, and/or modifications to expressed HtrA polypeptides including fragments, variants, and derivatives. Such modifications may enhance the immunogenicity of HtrA antigens, for example, by increasing cellular immune responses compared with unmodified polypeptides. Such modification may enhance solubility of the polypeptides. Alternatively, such modifications may have no effect. For example, C. trachomatis HtrA may be modified by introduction, deletion or modification of particular cleavage sites for proteolytic enzymes active in antigen presenting cells, to enhance immune responses to particular epitopes.\n\n\n[0125] In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid fragment, which encodes the HtrA polypeptide from Chlamydia trachomatis, e.g., SEQ ED NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO:8 or a fragment, variant, or derivative thereof. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, various nucleic acid coding regions will encode the same polypeptide due to the redundancy of the genetic code. Deviations in the nucleotide sequence that comprise the codons encoding the amino acids of any polypeptide chain allow for variations in the sequence coding for the gene. Since each codon consists of three nucleotides, and the nucleotides comprising DNA are restricted to four specific bases, there are 64 possible combinations of nucleotides, 61 of which encode amino acids (the remaining three codons encode signals ending translation). The \"genetic code\" which shows which codons encode which amino acids is reproduced herein as Table 9. As a result, many amino acids are designated by more than one codon. For example, the amino acids alanine and proline are coded \n\n for by four triplets, serine and arginine by six, whereas tryptophan and methionine are coded by just one triplet. This degeneracy allows for DNA base composition to vary over a wide range without altering the amino acid sequence of the polypeptides encoded by the DNA.\n\n\nTABLE 9: The Standard Genetic Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0126] It is to be appreciated that any polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide in accordance with the invention falls within the scope of this invention, irregardless of the codons used. [0127] Many organisms display a bias for use of particular codons to code for insertion of a particular amino acid in a growing polypeptide chain. Codon preference or codon bias, differences in codon usage between organisms, is afforded by degeneracy of the genetic code, and is well documented among many organisms. Codon bias often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, inter alia, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. \n\n [0128] The present invention relates to a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a coding optimized coding region which encodes a polypeptide disclosed herein. For example, a polynucleotide of the present invention comprises, consisting essentially of, or consisting of an amino acid sequence at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to the amino acid sequences of amino acids 1-151 or 1-169 of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6 or 8 or fragments thereof, wherein said polypeptide when administered to a subject in need thereof in a sufficient amount, induces an immune response against Chlamydia sp. The present invention further relates to any polynucleotide fragments described herein which is encoded fully or partly by a codon-optimized coding region. The codon usage is adapted for optimized expression in the cells of a given prokaryote or eukaryote.\n\n\n[0129] The polynucleotides are prepared by incorporating codons preferred for use in the genes of a given species into the DNA sequence. Also provided are polynucleotide expression constructs, vectors, host cells comprising nucleic acid fragments of codon-optimized coding regions which encode C. trachomatis polypeptides, and various methods of using the polynucleotide expression constructs, vectors, host cells to treat or prevent Chlamydia infections in an animal.\n\n\n[0130] Given the large number of gene sequences available for a wide variety of animal, plant and microbial species, it is possible to calculate the relative frequencies of codon usage. Codon usage tables are readily available, for example, at the \"Codon Usage Database\" available at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/ (visited May 30, 2006), and these tables can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura, Y., et al, \"Codon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000\" Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292 (2000). Codon usage tables for humans, Escherichia coli, and P. fluerescens calculated from GenBank Release 151.0, are reproduced below as Tables 10-12 (from http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/ supra). These tables use mRNA nomenclature, and so instead of thymine (T) which is found in DNA, the tables use uracil (U) which is found in RNA. The tables have been adapted so that frequencies are calculated for each amino acid, rather than for all 64 codons. \n\n TABLE 10: Codon Usage Table for Human Genes {Homo sapiens)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 1 : Codon Usage Table for Escherichia CoIi. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12: Codon Usage Table for P. Fluorescens. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0131] By utilizing these or similar tables, one of ordinary skill in the art can apply the frequencies to any given polypeptide sequence, and produce a nucleic acid fragment of a codon- optimized coding region which encodes the polypeptide, but which uses codons optimal for a given species. For example, in some embodiments of the present invention, the coding region is codon-optimized for expression in E. coli.\n\n\n[0132] Codon-optimized coding regions can be designed by various different methods. In one method, a codon usage table is used to find the single most frequent codon used for any given amino acid for a given organism, and that codon is used each time that particular amino acid appears in the polypeptide sequence. For example, referring to Table 11 above for E. coli, for leucine, the most frequent codon is CUG, which is used 55% of the time. Thus all the leucine residues in a given amino acid sequence would be assigned the codon CUG. [0133] Using this method, an E. coli codon-optimized coding region which encodes SΕQ ID NO:2 can be designed. Specifically, the codons are assigned to the coding region encoding SΕQ ID NO:2 as follows: the 19 phenylalanine codons are TTT, the 42 leucine codons are CTG, the 35 isoleucine codons are ATT, the 7 methionine codons are ATG, the 56 valine codons are GTG, the 34 serine codons are AGC, the 21 proline codons are CCG, the 24 threonine codons are ACC, \n\n the 40 alanine codons are GCG, the 9 tyrosine codons are TAT, the 6 histidine codons are CAT, the 27 glutamine codons are CAG, the 22 asparagine codons are AAC, the 29 lysine codons are AAA, the 26 aspartic acid codons are GAT, the 26 glutamic acid codons are GAA, the 4 cysteine codons are TGC, the 1 tryptophan codons are TGG, the 21 arginine codons are CGT, and the 48 glycine codons are GGC.\n\n\n[0134] Similarly, polynucleotides encoding SEQ ID NO:6 and SEQ ID NO:8 can be designed to have an E. coli or P. fluorescens codon-optimized coding region. Furthermore, polynucleotides encoding any C. trachomatis HtrA fragments, variants, or derivatives described herein can be designed to have an E. coli or P. fluorescens codon-optimized coding region. [0135] In another method, the actual frequencies of the codons are distributed randomly throughout the coding sequence. Thus using this method for optimization, if a hypothetical polypeptide sequence had 100 leucine residues, referring to Table 10 for frequency of usage in the humans, about 7, or 7% of the leucine codons would be UUA, about 13, or 13% of the leucine codons would be UUG, about 13, or 13% of the leucine codons would be CUU, about 20, or 20% of the leucine codons would be CUC, about 7, or 7% of the leucine codons would be CUA, and about 41, or 41% of the leucine codons would be CUG. These frequencies would be distributed randomly throughout the leucine codons in the coding region encoding the hypothetical polypeptide. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the distribution of codons in the sequence can vary significantly using this method, however, the sequence always encodes the same polypeptide.\n\n\n[0136] As used in the method described immediately above, \"about\" is defined as one amino acid more or one amino acid less than the value given. The whole number value of amino acids is rounded up if the fractional frequency of usage is 0.50 or greater, and is rounded down if the fractional frequency of use is 0.49 or less. Using the example of the frequency of usage of leucine in human genes for a hypothetical polypeptide having 62 leucine residues, the fractional frequency of codon usage would be calculated by multiplying 62 by the frequencies for the various codons. Thus, 7.28 percent of 62 equals 4.51 UUA codons, or \"about 5,\" i.e., 4, 5, or 6 UUA codons, 12.66 percent of 62 equals 7.85 UUG codons or \"about 8,\" i.e., 7, 8, or 9 UUG codons, etc. 12.87 percent of 62 equals 7.98 CUU codons, or \"about 8,\" i.e., 7, 8, or 9 CUU codons, 19.56 percent of 62 equals 12.13 CUC codons or \"about 12,\" i.e., 11, 12, or 13 CUC codons, 7.00 percent of 62 equals 4.34 CUA codons or \"about 4,\" i.e., 3, 4, or 5 CUA codons, and 40.62 percent of 62 equals 25.19 CUG codons, or \"about 25,\" i.e., 24, 25, or 26 CUG codons. \n\n [0137] In yet another method, variations of the first two methods listed above can be used. For example, to codon-optimize a polynucleotide sequence for a given host, the two codons used most frequently for a particular amino acid in the given host are identified, and then those two codons are used to encode at least 95% of that amino acid in the sequence of interest. However, the two codons selected for use for that amino acid can then be used at any frequency, independent of the frequency used in the organism. For example, to codon-optimize for E. coli a sequence encoding a hypothetical polypeptide having 62 serine residues, the fractional frequency of codon usage would be calculated by noting that in E. coli, the two most common codons for serine are AGC (27%) and UCU (19%). Thus, either AGC and UCU would be used to encode at least 95% of the serine codons.\n\n\n[0138] Using the methods, another E. coli codon-optimized coding region which encodes SEQ ID NO:2 can be designed. Specifically, the two codons used most frequently for a particular amino acid in E. coli are used at a frequency greater than 95% in the sequence of interest (Table 13, Column A). However, the two codons selected for use for that amino acid can then be used at any frequency, independent of the frequency used in E. coli (Table 13, Columns B, C, D). \n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13 Frequency of Codon Usage in E. coli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0139] Using this method, in one embodiment, codons assigned to the coding region encoding SEQ ID NO:2 are as follows: about 36-38 of the 40 alanine codons in said coding region are GCG and about 2-4 of the alanine codons are GCC; about 2-4 of the 4 cysteine codons in said coding region are TGT and about 0-2 of the cysteine codons are TGC; about 24-26 of the 26 aspartic acid codons in said coding region are GAT and about 0-2 of the aspartic acid codons are GAC; about 24-26 of the 26 glutamic acid codons in said coding region are GAA and about 0-2 of the glutamic acid codons are GAG; about 15-17 of the 19 phenylalanine codons in said coding region are TTC and about 2-4 of the phenylalanine codons are TTT; about 33-35 of the 48 glycine codons in said coding region are GGT and about 13-15 of the glycine codons are GGC; about 4-6 of the 6 histidine codons in said coding region are CAT and about 0-2 of the histidine codons are CAC; about 20-22 of the 35 isoleucine codons in said coding region are ATT and about 13-15 of the isoleucine codons are ATC; about 27-29 of the 29 lysine codons in said coding region are AAA and about 0-2 of the lysine codons are AAG; about 40-42 of the 42 leucine codons in said coding region are CTG; about 17-19 of the 22 asparagine codons in said coding region are AAC and about 3-5 of the asparagine codons are AAT; about 19-21 of the 21 proline codons in said coding region are GAT; about 25-27 of the 27 glutamine codons in said coding region are CAG and about 0-2 of the glutamine codons are CAA; about 13-15 of the 21 arginine codons in said coding region are CGT and about 6-8 of the arginine codons are CGC; about 17-19 of the 34 serine codons in said coding region are AGC and about 5-7 of the serine \n\n codons are TCT; about 22-24 of the 24 threonine codons in said coding region are ACC and about 0-2 of the threonine codons are ACG; about 30-32 of the 56 valine codons in said coding region are GTT and about 24-26 of the valine codons are GTG; and about 4-6 of the 9 tyrosine codons in said coding region are TAT and about 3-5 of the tyrosine codons are TAC. [0140] Using the above method, codons assigned to the coding region encoding SEQ ID NO:6 or SEQ ID NO:8 or any HtrA fragments, variants or derivatives described herein can be designed in a similar way.\n\n\n[0141] Furthermore, one of ordinary skill in the art could apply the same methodology used for E. coli in Table 13 and apply it to optimize codon usage for any other organism. Using the above methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art could optimize codon regions of nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to amino acids 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-68 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8, amino acids 1-79 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-112 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-144 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-68 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-79 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-144 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17- 169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-68 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-79 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-112 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-144 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-68 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 22-79 of SEQ TD NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 22-112 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 22-144 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 22-151 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 22-169 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 69-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95- 112 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 95-144 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 95- 151 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 95-169 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 110- 144 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 110-151 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 110- 169 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 113-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 113- 151 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 113-169 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 128- 144 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 128-151 of SEQ E) NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 128- \n\n 169 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 145-151 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 145- 169 of SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, or 8; amino acids 152-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; or a combination of at least two of any of said polypeptide fragments or variants or derivatives thereof. The present invention further provides a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the codon optimized coding region, which encodes any C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides, fragments, analogs, derivatives, or variants thereof described herein.\n\n\n[0142] Using a combination of codon-optimization techniques as described above, a P. fluorescens codon-optimized coding region can also be designed. Specifically, the two codons used most frequently for a particular amino acid in P. fluorescens can be used at a frequency greater than 95% in the sequence of interest (Table 14, Column A). However, the two codons selected for use for that amino acid can be used at any frequency, independent of the frequency used in P. fluorescens (Table 14, Columns B, C, D). \n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14 Frequency of Codon Usage in P. fluorescens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0143] As described above, the term \"about\" means that the number of amino acids encoded by a certain codon may be one more or one less than the number given. It would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the total number of any amino acid in the polypeptide sequence must remain constant, therefore, if there is one \"more\" of one codon encoding a given amino acid, there would have to be one \"less\" of another codon encoding that same amino acid. [0144] Randomly assigning codons at an optimized frequency to encode a given polypeptide sequence, can be done manually by calculating codon frequencies for each amino acid, and then assigning the codons to the polypeptide sequence randomly. Additionally, various algorithms and computer software programs are readily available to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the \"EditSeq\" function in the Lasergene Package, available from DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI, the backtranslation function in the VectorNTI Suite, available from InforMax, Inc., Bethesda, MD, and the \"backtranslate\" function in the GCG-- Wisconsin Package, available from Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA. Constructing a rudimentary algorithm to assign codons based on a given frequency can also easily be accomplished with basic mathematical functions by one of ordinary skill.\n\n\n[0145] Codon placement in a polynucleotide at an optimized frequency to encode a given polypeptide sequence can also be done in a directed manner. For example, a codon may be assigned to a particular amino acid so as to create or destroy a restriction enzyme cleavage site. Creation or destruction of restriction enzyme sites may facilitate DNA manipulation by assisting with cloning or forming identifying markers. Alternatively, a codon may be assigned to a particular amino acid so as to a desired secondary structure of the polynucleotide. \n\n [0146] In certain embodiments, an entire polypeptide sequence, or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof is codon optimized by any of the methods described herein or by other methods. Various desired fragments, variants or derivatives are designed, and each is then codon-optimized individually. In addition, partially codon-optimized coding regions of the present invention can be designed and constructed. For example, the invention includes a nucleic acid fragment of a codon-optimized coding region encoding a polypeptide in which at least about 1%, 2%, 3,% 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% of the codon positions have been codon-optimized for a given species. That is, they contain a codon that is preferentially used in the genes of a desired species, e.g., a vertebrate species, e.g., humans, in place of a codon that is normally used in the native nucleic acid sequence.\n\n\n[0147] In additional embodiments, a full-length polypeptide sequence is codon-optimized for a given species resulting in a codon-optimized coding region encoding the entire polypeptide, and then nucleic acid fragments of the codon-optimized coding region, which encode fragments, variants, and derivatives of the polypeptide are made from the original codon-optimized coding region. As would be well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, if codons have been randomly assigned to the full-length coding region based on their frequency of use in a given species, nucleic acid fragments encoding fragments, variants, and derivatives would not necessarily be fully codon optimized for the given species. However, such sequences are still much closer to the codon usage of the desired species than the native codon usage. The advantage of this approach is that synthesizing codon-optimized nucleic acid fragments encoding each fragment, variant, and derivative of a given polypeptide, although routine, would be time consuming and would result in significant expense.\n\n\n[0148] The present invention provides a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a codon-optimized coding region encoding a polypeptide at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO:8, and fragments, variants, or derivatives thereof described in Tables 3- 8. In certain embodiments described herein, a codon-optimized coding region encoding a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide, fragment, analog, derivative, or variant thereof described herein is optimized according to codon usage in E. coli. Alternatively, a codon-optimized coding region encoding the above polypeptide sequences may be optimized according to codon usage in any plant, animal, or microbial species, e.g., bacteria such as E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas βuorescens, yeast, fungi, humans, rates, mouse, primates, or rabbits. \n\n [0149] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid fragment which encodes at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, at least 95, or at least 100 or more contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, or 8, where the nucleic acid fragment is a fragment of a codon- optimized coding region encoding SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO: 8 and wherein the contiguous amino acids are within about amino acids 1-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO:8.\n\n\nDNA Synthesis\n\n\n[0150] A number of options are available for synthesizing codon optimized coding regions designed by any of the methods described above, using standard and routine molecular biological manipulations well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one approach, a series of complementary oligonucleotide pairs of 80-90 nucleotides each in length and spanning the length of the desired sequence are synthesized by standard methods. These oligonucleotide pairs are synthesized such that upon annealing, they form double stranded fragments of 80-90 base pairs, containing cohesive ends, e.g., each oligonucleotide in the pair is synthesized to extend 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more bases beyond the region that is complementary to the other oligonucleotide in the pair. The single-stranded ends of each pair of oligonucleotides is designed to anneal with the single-stranded end of another pair of oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide pairs are allowed to anneal, and approximately five to six of these double-stranded fragments are then allowed to anneal together via the cohesive single stranded ends, and then they ligated together and cloned into a standard bacterial cloning vector, for example, a TOPO vector available from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA. The construct is then sequenced by standard methods. Several of these constructs consisting of 5 to 6 fragments of 80 to 90 base pair fragments ligated together, i.e., fragments of about 500 base pairs, are prepared, such that the entire desired sequence is represented in a series of plasmid constructs. The inserts of these plasmids are then cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated together to form the final construct. The final construct is then cloned into a standard bacterial cloning vector, and sequenced. Additional methods would be immediately apparent to the skilled artisan. In addition, gene synthesis is readily available commercially. DNA Hybridization\n\n\n[0151] \"Hybridization\" refers to the association of two nucleic acid sequences to one another by hydrogen bonding. Typically, one sequence will be fixed to a solid support and the other will be \n\n free in solution. Then, the two sequences will be placed in contact with one another under conditions that favor hydrogen bonding. Factors that affect this bonding include: the type and volume of solvent; reaction temperature; time of hybridization; agitation; agents to block the non-specific attachment of the liquid phase sequence to the solid support (Denhardt's reagent or Blotto); concentration of the sequences; use of compounds to increase the rate of association of sequences (dextran sulfate or polyethylene glycol); and the stringency of the washing conditions following hybridization.\n\n\n[0152] \"Stringency\" refers to hybridization conditions that favor association of very similar sequences over sequences that differ. Hybridization conditions of moderate stringency are as follows: Filters containing DNA are pre-treated for 6 hours at 40\n0\nC in a solution containing 10% to 35% formamide, 5 X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations are carried out in a solution containing 6 X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 ug/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA.\n\n\n[0153] Hybridization conditions of high stringency are as follows: Filters containing DNA are pre-treated for 6 hours at 40\n0\nC in a solution containing 36% to 50% formamide, 5 X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations are carried out in a solution containing 6 X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 ug/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA.\n\n\n[0154] Hybridization conditions of very high stringency are as follows: Filters containing DNA are pre-treated for 6 hours at 40\n0\nC in a solution containing 51% to 70% formamide, 5 X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations are carried out in a solution containing 6 X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA.\n\n\n[0155] A genomic library to screen polynucleotide sequences encoding a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide can be screened by hybridization to labeled oligonucleotide or other polynucleotide probes. These probes are DNA or RNA molecules, e.g., single-stranded. Hybridization conditions are controlled such that the probes hybridize to nucleic acids that are identical to SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Under certain conditions, the probes also hybridize to nucleic acids that are 95% or 99% identical to SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Alternatively, conditions are such that the probes hybridize to nucleic acids at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or \n\n 99% identical to SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Typically, suitable probes are fragments which are significantly shorter than the full length sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Suitable fragments can contain from 5 to 100 nucleotides, preferably about 10 to about 80 nucleotides. The nucleotide sequence of such fragments is typically at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a portion of the sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7 or its complement. Suitable fragments can contain modified bases such as inosine, methyl-5- deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, demithylamino-5-deoxyuridine, or diamino-2,6 purine. Clones in libraries which contain insert genomic DNA fragments encoding an HtrA polypeptide will hybridize to one or more of the fragments.\n\n\n[0156] A nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO:2, fragments, analogs, derivatives, or variants described herein is useful for its ability to hybridize selectively, i.e., form duplex molecules with complementary stretches of other polypeptide genes. Depending on the application, a variety of hybridization conditions may be employed to achieve varying sequence identities. In specific aspects, nucleic acids are provided which comprise a sequence complementary to at least 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 nucleotides of the nucleic acid encoding a HtrA polypeptide described above. In specific embodiments, nucleic acids which hybridize to a HtrA protein nucleic acid (e.g. having sequence SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, 5, or 7) under annealing conditions of low, moderate or high stringency conditions are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n[0157] For a high degree of selectivity, relatively stringent conditions are used to form the duplexes, such as, by way of example and not limitation, low salt and/or high temperature conditions, such as provided by hybridization in a solution of salt, e.g., 0.02 M to 0.15 M NaCl at temperatures of between about 5O\n0\nC to 7O\n0\nC. For some applications, less stringent hybridization conditions are required, by way of example and not limitation such as provided by hybridization in a solution of 0.15 M to 0.9 M salt, e.g., NaCl, at temperatures ranging from between about 2O\n0\nC to 55\n0\nC. Hybridization conditions can also be rendered more stringent by the addition of increasing amounts of formamide, to destabilize the hybrid duplex. Thus, particular hybridization conditions can be readily manipulated. By way of example and not limitation, in general, convenient hybridization temperatures in the presence of 50% formamide are: 42\n0\nC for a probe which is 95 to 100% homologous to the target fragment, 37\n0\nC for 90 to 95% homology and 32\n0\nC for 70 to 90% homology. One aspect of the invention is directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid fragment which hybridizes, upon incubation in a \n\n solution comprising 50% formamide at about 37\n0\nC, to a DNA sequence which is complementary to any one of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ BD NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7 or fragments thereof, or a polynucleotide that is a codon-optimized coding region encoding a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO: 6, or SEQ ID NO: 8 or fragments thereof, wherein the nucleic acid fragment encodes a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide which is soluble when expressed in E. coli. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is recognized by an antibody that specifically binds to a polypeptide consisting of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ E) NO:6, or SEQ E) NO:8.\n\n\n[0158] Other low, moderate and high stringency conditions are well known to those of skill in the art, and will vary predictably depending on the base composition and length of the particular nucleic acid sequence and on the specific organism from which the nucleic acid sequence is derived. For guidance regarding such conditions see, for example, Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, N. Y., pp. 9.47-9.57 (1989); and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, N. Y. (1989) both of which are incorporate herein, by reference. [0159] In one embodiment of the invention, the invention excludes polynucleotides capable of hybridizing under high stringency conditions to mammalian proteins. Vectors and Expression Systems\n\n\n[0160] The present invention further provides a vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention. The term \"vector,\" as used herein, refers to any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors may be DNA or RNA. Vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, phage, phagemids, bacterial genomes, and virus genomes and virus-like particles. A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate in a host cell, and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids, replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage, replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced. Other vectors are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. \n\n [0161] Any of a wide variety of suitable cloning vectors are known in the art and commercially available which can be used with appropriate hosts. The vector can be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, a phage, cosmid, etc. As used herein, the term \"plasmid\" refers to a circular, double-stranded construct made up of genetic material (i.e., nucleic acids), wherein the genetic material is extrachromosomal and replicates autonomously. A polynucleotide of the present invention may be in a circular or linearized plasmid or vector, or other linear DNA which may also be non-infectious and nonintegrating (i.e., does not integrate into the genome of host cells). Procedures for inserting a nucleotide sequence into an expression vector, and transforming or transfecting into an appropriate host cell and cultivating under conditions suitable for expression are generally known in the art, as described generally in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York (1989). The term \"all or part of a carrier organism or virus\" as used herein refers to an entity genetically modified so as to recombinantly express an antigen, of which entity either the entirety, living or non-living, or a membrane fragment, host, or other part may be incorporated in a vaccine composition.\n\n\n[0162] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae HtrA polypeptides or fragments, variants, derivatives, or analogs thereof described herein, where said nucleic acid sequence does not hybridize to mammalian nucleic acids under high stringency conditions. For instance, the present invention includes a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide consisting essentially of amino acids 1-151 or 1-169 of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6 or 8 or an immunogenic fragment thereof. In particular, the present invention is directed to a vector comprising a polynucleotide of the invention. The polypeptide can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to a reference amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids a-169 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids b-151 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 1-c of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids a-c of SEQ ID NO:2; and amino acids b-c of SEQ ID NO:2; wherein a is any integer between 1 and 159, b is any integer between 1 andl41, and c is any integer between 10 and 169. In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a polynucleotide which lacks a nucleic acid sequence encoding an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: amino acids d-497 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids e-497 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 171 -f of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 152-g of SEQ ID NO.2; amino acids d-f of SEQ ID NO:2; and amino acids e-g of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein d is any integer between 171 \n\n and 490, e is any integer between 152 and 490, f is any integer between 181 and 497, and g is any integer between 162 and 497.\n\n\n[0163] The present invention also includes a vector comprising a polynucleotide which encodes a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of an amino acid sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to a reference amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acids 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8\n\"\n, amino acids 1-68 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8, amino acids 1-79 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-112 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-144 of SEQ ED NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 1-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-68 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-79 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-112 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-144 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-68 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-79 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-112 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-144 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 20-169 of SEQ E\n)\n NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-68 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-79 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-144 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69- 144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 69-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 80-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-112 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-151 of SEQ E\n)\n NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 113-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 113-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 113-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-144 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 145-151 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 145-169 of SEQ E) NO:2, 6 or 8; and a combination of at least two of any of said polypeptide fragments or variants or derivatives \n\n thereof, wherein said polypeptide when administered to a subject in need thereof in a sufficient amount, induces an immune response against Chlamydia sp.\n\n\n[0164] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a vector comprising a polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a nucleotide sequence encoding an HtrA polypeptide variant that lacks protease activity, wherein said polypeptide retains immunogenicity or antigenicity.\n\n\n[0165] In other embodiments, the present invention is further directed to a vector comprising a nucleic acid fragment, where the nucleic acid fragment is a fragment of a codon-optimized coding region operably encoding any C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides described herein. Furthermore, the present invention includes a vector comprising any polynucleotides of the present invention.\n\n\n[0166] Additional Chlamydia-deήved coding or non-coding regions may also be included on the vector, e.g. , a plasmid, or on a separate vector, and expressed, either using native Chlamydia codons or codons optimized for expression in the host in which the polypeptide is being expressed. When such a vector is delivered to a host, e.g., to a bacterial, plant or eukaryotic cell, or alternatively, in vivo to a tissue of the animal to be treated or immunized, the transcriptional unit will thus express the encoded gene product. The level of expression of the gene product will depend to a significant extent on the strength of the associated promoter and the presence and activation of an associated enhancer element, as well as the optimization of the coding region. [0167] A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the polypeptides of the present invention. The term \"expression vector\" refers to a vector that is capable of expressing the polypeptide of the present invention, i.e., the vector sequence contains the regulatory sequences required for polypeptide expression such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, etc. The term \"expression\" refers to the biological production of a product encoded by a coding sequence. In most cases a DNA sequence, including the coding sequence, is transcribed to form a messenger-RNA (mRNA). The messenger-RNA is then translated to form a polypeptide product which has a relevant biological activity. Also, the process of expression may involve further processing steps to the RNA product of transcription, such as splicing to remove introns, and/or post-translational processing of a polypeptide product.\n\n\n[0168] Vector-host systems include, but are not limited to, systems such as bacterial, mammalian, yeast, insect or plant cell systems, either in vivo, e.g., in an animal or in vitro, e.g., in mammalian cell cultures. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. \n\n [0169] Host cells are genetically engineered (transduced or transformed or transfected) with the vectors of this invention as described above. Thus, one aspect of the invention is directed to a host cell comprising a vector which contains a polynucleotide of the present invention. The engineered host cell can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the polynucleotides. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The term \"transfect,\" as used herein, refers to any procedure whereby eukaryotic cells are induced to accept and incorporate into their genome isolated DNA, including but not limited to DNA in the form of a plasmid. The term \"transform,\" as used herein, refers to any procedure whereby bacterial cells are induced to accept and incorporate into their genome isolated DNA, including but not limited to DNA in the form of a plasmid.\n\n\n[0170] Bacterial host-expression vector systems include, but are not limited to, a prokaryote (e.g., E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, e.g., P. aeruginosa or P. fluorescens (e.g. PFENEX™ (Dowpharma)), Streptomyces sp., or Staphylococcus sp.) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing polypeptide coding regions of the present invention. In some embodiments, the PFENEX™ system is used. The PFENEX™ expression system utilizes P. fluorescens biovar I, designated MBlOl, and compatible plasmids. In some embodiments, the plasmids used with P. fluorescens use the tac promoter system regulated by the Lad protein via IPTG induction. In some embodiments, the bacterial host can have a auxotrophic chromosomal deletion, e.g., pyrF, in which the deletion is complemented by the vector, to alleviate the need for antibiotic-resistance genes. A large number of suitable vectors are known to those of skill in the art, and are commercially available. The following bacterial vectors are provided by way of example: pET, pET28, pBAD, pTrcHIS, pBR322, pQE70, ρQE60, pQE-9 (Qiagen), phagescript, psiX174, pBluescript SK, pbsks, pNH8A, pNHlόa, pNH18A, pNH46A (Stratagene), ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pBR322, pPSIO, RSFlOlO, pRIT5 (Pharmacia); pCR (Invitrogen); pLex (Invitrogen), and pUC plasmid derivatives. Another example of a suitable vector for the present invention are Vaccinia vectors, e.g., Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Vector. However, any other plasmid or vector can be used as long as it is replicable and viable in the host. In some embodiments, the expression vector comprises the plasmid pLex. The pLex plasmid comprises a multiple cloning site that is tightly regulated by a tryptophan-inducible expression system utilizing the strong PL promoter \n\n from bacteriophage lambda, and the cl repressor protein. This pLex expression vector is especially useful for the expression of potentially toxic proteins in E. coli. In addition, the lambda promoter provides high-level expression of recombinant proteins.\n\n\n[0171] Alternately, a Chlamydia, for instance, C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae, HtrA polypeptide antigen can be recombinantly expressed directly in a carrier organism, or virus, all or part of which is subsequently incorporated in a vaccine composition, as described in Eko, et al, Immunol., 173:3375-3382, 2004, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. For instance, the present invention includes the recombinant expression of a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide in an attenuated gram-negative pathogen. In one embodiment, the gram negative pathogen is a Salmonella sp., for instance, S. typhi or S. typhimurium. The attenuated Salmonella vaccine carrier can have at least one attenuating mutation in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) region as described in US Patent Numbers 6,342,215 and 6,936,425, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In another embodiment, the attenuated Salmonella vaccine carrier comprises attenuating mutations in an aro gene {e.g., aroC gene) and a SP 12 gene {e.g., ssaV gene) as described in US patent number 6,756,042, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. For instance, the present invention includes the expression of a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide by a Salmonella vaccine carrier prepared by inserting a gene cassette comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide. In one embodiment, the expression cassette is inserted in a mutated gene of the Salmonella sp., for instance, in the aroC or ssaV genes. In one embodiment, the construct is a deletion/insertion construct {i.e., at least one Salmonella gene contains a deletion mutation and the gene expression cassette comprising the nucleic acid sequence encoding the Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide is inserted in the deletion sites). The Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide can be under the control of promoters known in the art, including for instance, the ssaG promoter of S. typhi. In one embodiment, the organism is an attenuated Salmonella typhi or typhimurium with deletion mutations in the ssa V and aroC genes, and a gene cassette comprising a Chlamydia htrA nucleic acid sequence under the control of a ssaG promoter is inserted in the aroC and/or ssa V deletion sites.\n\n\n[0172] In another embodiment, a viral vaccine carrier can be used to express a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide. Such viral vaccine carriers include, but are not limited to modified vaccinia virus {e.g., MVA).\n\n\n[0173] Alternatively, Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide vaccine antigens can be purified from infected-host cell culture. For instance, if a baculovirus expression system is used to express a \n\n Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide, the polypeptide can be isolated and purified from a baculovirus infected insect cell culture. Accordingly, the present invention should be understood to include a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. [0174] A suitable expression vector contains regulatory sequences which can be operably joined to an inserted nucleotide sequence encoding a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide vaccine antigen. As used herein, the term \"regulatory sequences\" means nucleotide sequences which are necessary for or conducive to the transcription of an inserted sequence coding a C. trachomatis HtrA vaccine antigen by a host cell and/or which are necessary for or conducive to the translation by a host cell of the resulting transcript into the desired HtrA polypeptide. Regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to, 5' sequences such as operators, promoters and ribosome binding sequences, and 3' sequences such as polyadenylation signals. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences.\n\n\n[0175] Generally, bacterial vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers, e.g., the ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, resistance genes of E. coli, permitting transformation of the host cell and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. Such promoters include, but are not limited to, the T7 promoter, lambda (λ) promoter, T5 promoter, and lac promoter, or promoters derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), acid phosphatase, or heat shock proteins, among others.\n\n\n[0176] Once an expression vector is selected, the polynucleotide of the invention is cloned downstream of the promoter, often in a polylinker region. This plasmid is transformed into an appropriate bacterial strain, and DNA is prepared using standard techniques. The orientation and DNA sequence of the polynucleotide as well as all other elements included in the vector, are confirmed using restriction mapping, DNA sequence analysis, and/or PCR analysis. Bacterial cells harboring the correct plasmid can be stored as cell banks.\n\n\n[0177] Examples of mammalian host-expression systems include cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the COS, C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Examples of suitable expression vectors include pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXTl, pSG (Stratagene) pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, pSVL (Pharmacia), p75.6 (Valentis), pCEP (Invitrogen), pCEI (Epimmune), pZERO, pTrc99A, pUC19, pUC18, pKK223-3, pEXl, pCAL, pET, pSPUTK, pTrxFus, pFastBac, pThioHis, pTrcHis, and pLEx, pET-17b, pET-1 Ia, pET-24a- d(+) and pET-9a pK233 (or any of the tac family of plasmids), pT7, lambda pSKF, and pET- 28(a)+, vectors useful in yeast cells, including YIp, YRp, YCP, YEp and YLp plasmids as well \n\n as viral genomes from which to construct viral vectors such as Simian virus 40 (SV40), bovine papilloma virus, pox virus such as vaccinia virus, e.g., VV MVA, and parvovirus, including adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, herpesvirus, adenovirus, retroviral, e.g., murine leukemia virus and lentiviruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus), alphavirus, and picornavirus. References citing methods for the in vivo introduction of non-infectious virus genomes to animal tissues are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Any of a variety of methods known in the art can be used to insert a nucleotide sequence coding for a C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide vaccine antigen into a suitable expression vector.\n\n\n[0178] Generally, mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5' flanking nontranscribed sequences. Such promoters may also be derived from viral sources, such as, e.g., human cytomegalovirus (CMV-IE promoter), herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV TK promoter), the adenovirus late promoter; and the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter, or can be derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter). Nucleic acid sequences derived from the SV40 splice and polyadenylation sites can be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements. A variety of transcription control regions are known to those skilled in the art. These include, without limitation, transcription control regions which function in animal cells, such as, but not limited to, promoter and enhancer segments from cytomegaloviruses (the immediate early promoter, in conjunction with intron-A), simian virus 40 (the early promoter), and retroviruses (such as Rous sarcoma virus). Other transcription control regions include those derived from animal genes such as actin, heat shock protein, bovine growth hormone and rabbit β-globin, as well as other sequences capable of controlling gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Additional suitable transcription control regions include tissue-specific promoters and enhancers as well as lymphokine-inducible promoters (e.g., promoters inducible by interferons or interleukins). Similarly, a variety of translation control elements are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, but are not limited to ribosome binding sites, translation initiation and termination codons, elements from picornaviruses (particularly an internal ribosome entry site, or IRES, also referred to as a CITE sequence). [0179] Yeast host-expression systems include a yeast host (e.g., Saccharomyces, Pichia, Hansenula, Kluyveromyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Schwanniomyces and Yarrowia) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing polypeptide coding sequences, employing suitable vectors and control sequences. Suitable yeast expression vectors are known to those in \n\n the art and include, but are not limited to, e.g., pAL19, paR3, pBGl, pDBlet, pDB248X, pEA500, pFL20, pIRT2, pJK148, pON163, pSPl, pSP3, pUR19, pARTl, pCHY21, REP41, pYZIN, pSLF104, pSLF172, pDS472, pSGP572, pSLF1072, REP41MH-N, pFA6a-kanMX6, pARTCM, and pALL.\n\n\n[0180] Insect host systems (e.g., Trichoplusia, Lipidotera, Spodoptera, Drosophila and Sf9) infected with recombinant expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus, pDEST™10 Vector (Invitrogen), pMT-DEST48 Vector (Invitrogen), pFastBac Dual (Invitrogen), pIEl-neo DNA (Novagen), pIEX™-l DNA (Novagen), containing polypeptide coding sequences of the present invention are also within the scope of the invention. See e.g., O'Reilly et al, Baculovirus Expression Vectors : A Laboratory Manual. Oxford Univ Press (1994).\n\n\n[0181] Plant cell systems (e.g., Arabidopsis) infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing polypeptide coding sequences of the present invention, containing polypeptide coding sequences are also within the scope of the invention. A list of vectors for a wide variety of plants can be found at http://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/Order?state=catalog (viewed June 20, 2006). [0182] One of skill in the art will recognize that some of the above listed vectors are capable of replicating and expressing polypeptides in more than one type of host, e.g., the pOG44 plasmid can replicate and express polypeptides in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Polypeptides\n\n\n[0183] Also included within the scope of the invention are full-length or mature C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides or fragments of a full-length or mature C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide, or of serotypic or other variants, analogs, or derivatives of C. trachomatis HtrA.

The invention also includes HtrA polypeptide from Chlamydia pneumoniae. C. trachomatis is comprised of two human biovars: the trachoma biovar and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar. The LGV biovar consists of four serovars, L\n1\n, L\n2\n, L\n2a\n, and L\n3\n. Serovars in both C. trachomatis biovars cause trachoma, sexually transmitted disease, some forms of arthritis, and neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis and pneumonia.\n\n\n[0185] In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a fragment which comprises one or more CD4(+) ThI epitopes.

In one embodiment of the invention, the heterologous peptide is a chemokine or a cytokine, for instance, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-I l, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17 or IL-18.\n\n\n[0198] Other Chlamydia proteins (either native proteins or variants, fragments, or derivatives thereof, e.g., MOMP, PorB, Pmp6, Pmp8, Pmpl 1, Pmp20, Pmp21, PmpD, PmpE, PmpG, PmpH, Pmpl, OmpH, 0mp4, 0mp5, Omp85, MIP, OmcA, and OmcB) may be fused to a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide of the present invention. For instance, the heterologous polypeptide may comprise a PmpG polypeptide fragment such as CT84 as described in US Application 60/929,129, filed June 14, 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, the present invention includes a HtrA and PmpG fusion protein. In some embodiments, the fusion protein may further comprise a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium. [0199] In some embodiments, the polypeptide of the present invention can exist as a homopolymer, comprising multiple copies of the same polypeptide.\n\n\n[0200] Optionally, a HtrA polypeptide fused with a heterologous polypeptide or other Chlamydia polypeptide can include a peptide linker sequence joining sequences that comprise two or more epitopes. Suitable peptide linker sequences may be chosen based on their ability to adopt a flexible, extended conformation, or a secondary structure that could interact with joined epitopes, or based on their ability to increase overall solubility of the fusion polypeptide, or based on their lack of electrostatic or water-interaction effects that influence joined epitopes. An example is a polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:30. This comprises two \"copies\" of the T-cell epitope of SEQ ID NO: 19, joined with the flexible linker GGSGGS, described by Wang, et al, Haematologica, 87(10): 1087-1094, 2002. \n\n [0201] Peptide and polypeptide sequences defined herein are represented by one-letter symbols for amino acid residues as follows: A (alanine); R (arginine); N (asparagine); D (aspartic acid); C (cysteine); Q (glutamine); E (glutamic acid); G (glycine); H (histidine); I (isoleucine); L (leucine); K (lysine); M (methionine); F (phenylalanine); P (proline); S (serine); T (threonine); W (tryptophan); Y (tyrosine); and V (valine).\n\n\n[0202] In some embodiments, the polypeptides of the present invention are isolated. No particular level of purification is required. Recombinantly produced Chlamydia polypeptides and proteins expressed in host cells are considered isolated for purposes of the invention, as are native or recombinant Chlamydia polypeptides which have been separated, fractionated, or partially or substantially purified by any suitable technique, including by filtration, chromatography, centrifugation, and the like.\n\n\n[0203] Polypeptides, and fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof of the present invention can be antigenic and immunogenic Chlamydia polypeptides, which are used to prevent or treat, i.e., cure, ameliorate, lessen the severity of, or prevent or reduce contagion of infectious disease caused by C. trachomatis, or other species as disclosed herein. The term \"antigens\" and its related term \"antigenic\" as used herein and in the claims refer to a substance that binds specifically to an antibody or T-cell receptor. In some embodiments the antigens are immunogenic. The term \"immunogen,\" as used herein, refers to an antigen capable of inducing an immune response directed against itself when administered to a subject. [0204] In certain aspects of the present invention, antigenic epitopes can contain a sequence of at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, or between about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention. Certain polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 or more amino acid residues in length. Antigenic as well as immunogenic epitopes may be linear, i.e., be comprised of contiguous amino acids in a polypeptide, or may be three dimensional, i.e., where an epitope is comprised of non-contiguous amino acids which come together due to the secondary or tertiary structure of the polypeptide, thereby forming an epitope. [0205] Peptides or polypeptides, e.g., immunogenic epitopes, capable of eliciting an immunogenic response are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals. Polypeptides that are extremely hydrophobic and those of six or fewer residues generally are ineffective at inducing antibodies, \n\n but may still bind antibodies raised against larger portions of the polypeptide; longer peptides, especially those containing proline residues, usually are effective (Sutcliffe, J. G., et al, Science 219:660-666 (1983)).\n\n\n[0206] Production of the polypeptides of the present invention can be achieved by culturing the host cells, expressing the polynucleotides of the present invention, and recovering the polypeptides. Determining conditions for culturing the host cells and expressing the polynucleotide are generally specific to the host cell and the expression system and are within the knowledge of one of skill in the art. Likewise, appropriate methods for recovering the polypeptide of interest are known to those in the art, and include, but are not limited to, chromatography, filtration, precipitation, or centrifugation.\n\n\nCompositions\n\n\n[0207] Compositions, e.g., vaccine compositions that contain an immunologically effective amount of one or more polypeptides or polynucleotides of the invention are a further embodiment of the invention. Such compositions may include, for example, lipopeptides (e.g.,Vitiello, A. et al, J. Clin. Invest. 95:341, 1995), polypeptides encapsulated e.g., in poly(DL- lactide-co-glycolide) (\"PLG\") microspheres {see, e.g., Eldridge, et al, Molec. Immunol. 28:287- 294, 1991 : Alonso et al, Vaccine 12:299-306, 1994; Jones et al, Vaccine 13:675-681, 1995); polypeptide compositions contained in immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMS) (see, e.g., Takahashi et al, Nature 344:873-875, 1990; Hu, et al, Clin Exp Immunol 113:235-243, 1998); multiple antigen peptide systems (MAPs) {see e.g., Tarn, J. P., Proc. Natl Acad. Sd. U.S.A. 85:5409-5413, 1988; Tarn, J.P., J. Immunol Methods 196:17-32, 1996); particles of viral or synthetic origin {e.g., Kofler, N. et al, J. Immunol. Methods. 192:25, 1996; Eldridge, J. H. et al, Sem. Hematol. 30:16, 1993; FaIo, L. D., Jr. et al, Nature Med. 7:649, 1995); adjuvants {e.g., incomplete Freund's adjuvant) (Warren, H. S., Vogel, F. R., and Chedid, L. A. Annu. Rev. Immunol 4:369, 1986; Gupta, R. K. et al, Vaccine 11 :293, 1993); or liposomes (Reddy, R. et al, J. Immunol. 148:1585, 1992; Rock, K. L., Immunol. Today 17:131, 1996). The compositions can be pharmaceutical, antigenic, immunogenic, or vaccine compositions.\n\n\n[0208] Compositions, e.g, vaccine compositions, of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods. Suitable preparation methods are described, for example, in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, A. Osol, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1980), and Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Edition, A.R. Gennaro, ed., Mack \n\n Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1995), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Although the composition may be administered as an aqueous solution, it can also be formulated as an emulsion, gel, solution, suspension, lyophilized form, or any other form known in the art. In addition, the composition may contain pharmaceutically acceptable additives including, for example, diluents, binders, stabilizers, and preservatives. Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to the subject. The subjects to be treated can be animals; in particular, human subjects can be treated.\n\n\n[0209] The concentration of polypeptides of the invention in the compositions of the invention can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.1%, usually at or at least about 2% to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.\n\n\n[0210] Furthermore, compositions in accordance with the invention can comprise more than one polypeptide. In some embodiments, a composition, e.g., a vaccine composition of the present invention can further include a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of, but not limited to, MOMP, PorB, Pmp6, Pmp8, Pmpl l, Pmp20, Pmp21, PmpD, PmpE, PmpG, PmpH, Pmpl, OmpH, 0mp4, 0mp5, Omp85, MIP, OmcA, and OmcB; as well as more than one HtrA polypeptide described herein.\n\n\n[0211] In other embodiments, the present invention includes a composition comprising a polypeptide fused with a heterologous polypeptide described herein.\n\n\n[0212] In some embodiments, a host cell having a vector expressing the polypeptide of the present invention is incorporated in a composition, as described in Eko, et al, J. Immunol., 173:3375-3382, 2004.\n\n\n[0213] The present invention is also directed to a method of producing a polypeptide vaccine composition effective against Chlamydia infection. In some embodiments, the method of producing the composition comprises (a) isolating the polypeptide of the present invention; and (b) adding an adjuvant, carrier and/or excipient to the isolated polypeptide. As the person of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, the terms \"adjuvant,\" \"carrier,\" and \"excipient\" overlap to a significant extent. For example, a compound which acts as an \"adjuvant\" may also be a \"carrier,\" as well as an \"excipient,\" and certain other compounds normally thought of, e.g., as carriers, may also function as an adjuvant. The term \"adjuvant\" refers to any material having the ability to (1) alter or increase the immune response to a particular antigen or (2) increase or aid an effect of a pharmacological agent. Any compound which may increase the expression, antigenicity or immunogenicity of the polypeptide is a potential adjuvant. The term \n\n \"immunogenic carrier\" as used herein refers to a first polypeptide or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof which enhances the immunogenicity of a second polypeptide or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof.\n\n\n[0214] In some embodiments, the present invention provides a composition comprising a polypeptide at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to any Chlamydia, for instance C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae, HtrA sequences, fragments, analogs, derivatives, or variants described herein, e.g., in Tables 2-8 and a carrier. Carriers that can be used with compositions of the invention are well known in the art, and include, without limitation, e.g., thyroglobulin, albumins such as human serum albumin, tetanus toxoid, polyamino acids such as poly L-lysine, poly L-glutamic acid, influenza, hepatitis B virus core protein, and the like. A variety of aqueous carriers may be used, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.8% saline, 0.3% glycine, hyaluronic acid and the like. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile solution prior to administration. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. In some embodiments, the carrier is an immunogenic carrier. Suitably, an immunogenic carrier may be fused to or conjugated to a desired polypeptide or fragment thereof. See, e.g., European Patent No. EP 0385610 Bl, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n[0215] Certain compositions can further include one or more adjuvants before, after, or concurrently with the polypeptide. A great variety of materials have been shown to have adjuvant activity through a variety of mechanisms. Potential adjuvants which may be screened for their ability to enhance the immune response according to the present invention include, but are not limited to: inert carriers, such as alum, bentonite, latex, and acrylic particles; pluronic block polymers, such as TITERMAX® (block copolymer CRL-8941, squalene (a metabolizable oil) and a microparticulate silica stabilizer), depot formers, such as Freund's adjuvant, surface active materials, such as saponin, lysolecithin, retinal, Quil A, liposomes, and pluronic polymer formulations; macrophage stimulators, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide; polycationic polymers such as chitosan; alternate pathway complement activators, such as insulin, zymosan, endotoxin, and levamisole; and non-ionic surfactants, such as poloxamers, poly(oxyethylene)- \n\n poly(oxypropylene) tri-block copolymers, cytokines and growth factors; bacterial components (e.g., endotoxins, in particular superantigens, exotoxins and cell wall components); aluminum- based salts such as aluminum hydroxide; calcium-based salts; silica; polynucleotides; toxoids; serum proteins, viruses and virally-derived materials, poisons, venoms, imidazoquiniline compounds, poloxamers, mLT, and cationic lipids. International Patent Application, PCT/US95/09005 incorporated herein by reference describes use of a mutated form of heat labile toxin of enterotoxigenic E. coli (\"mLT\") as an adjuvant. U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,540, incorporated herein by reference, describes the adjuvant, Qs21. In some embodiments, the adjuvant is a toll- like receptor (TLR) stimulating adjuvant. See e.g., Science 572:184-187 (2006). TLR adjuvants include compounds that stimulate the TLRs (e.g., TLRl - TLRl 7), resulting in an increased immune system response to the vaccine composition of the present invention. TLR adjuvants include, but are not limited to CpG (Coley Pharmaceutical Group Inc.) and MPL (Corixa). One example of a CpG adjuvant is CpG7909, described in WO 98/018810, US Patent Application Publication No. 2002/016434 IA, US 6,727,230, and WO98/32462, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n[0216] Dosages of the adjuvants can vary according to the specific adjuvants. For example, in some aspects, dosage ranges can include: 10 μg/dose to 500 μg/dose, or 50 μg/dose to 200 μg/dose for CpG. Dosage ranges can include: 2 μg/dose to 100 μg/dose, or 10 μg/dose to 30 μg/dose for MPL. Dosage ranges can include: 10 μg/dose to 500 μg/dose, or 50 μg/dose to 100 μg/dose for aluminum hydroxide. In a prime-boost regimen, as described elsewhere herein, an adjuvant may be used with either the priming immunization, the booster immunization, or both. [0217] In certain adjuvant compositions, the adjuvant is a cytokine. Certain compositions of the present invention comprise one or more cytokines, chemokines, or compounds that induce the production of cytokines and chemokines, or a polynucleotide encoding one or more cytokines, chemokines, or compounds that induce the production of cytokines and chemokines. Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), colony stimulating factor (CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 5 (IL-5), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 7 (IL-7), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 9 (IL-9), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 11 (IL-I l), interleukin 12 (IL- 12), interleukin 13 (IL- 13), interleukin 14 (IL- 14), interleukin 15 (IL- 15), interleukin 16 (IL- 16), interleukin 17 (IL- 17), interleukin 18 (IL- 18), interferon alpha (IFN), interferon beta (IFN), interferon gamma (IFN), interferon omega (IFN), interferon tau (IFN), \n\n interferon gamma inducing factor I (IGIF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-), RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted), macrophage inflammatory proteins (e.g., MIP- 1 alpha and MIP-I beta), Leishmania elongation initiating factor (LEIF), and Flt-3 ligand.\n\n\n[0218] The ability of an adjuvant to increase the immune response to an antigen is typically manifested by a significant increase in immune-mediated reaction, or reduction in disease symptoms. For example, an increase in humoral immunity is typically manifested by a significant increase in the titer of antibodies raised to the antigen, and an increase in T-cell activity is typically manifested in increased cell proliferation, or cellular cytotoxicity, or cytokine secretion. An adjuvant may also alter an immune response, for example, by changing a primarily humoral or Th2 response into a primarily cellular, or Th^ response. Immune responses to a given antigen may be tested by various immunoassays well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and/or described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n[0219] Furthermore, the HtrA antigen may be conjugated to a bacterial toxoid, such as a toxoid from diphtheria, tetanus, cholera, H. pylori, or other pathogen. Furthermore, the HtrA antigen may be conjugated to a bacterial polysaccharide, such as the capsular polysaccharide from Neisseria spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae spp. or Haemophilus influenzae type-b bacteria. [0220] hi one embodiment of the invention, a polypeptide of the invention is expressed by an attenuated bacterial (e.g., Salmonella spp. or other heterologous bacteria) or viral vaccine carrier (e.g., MVA). The present invention thus includes compositions comprising an attenuated bacterial or viral vaccine carrier which expresses a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide. The nucleic acid encoding the HtrA polypeptide may be in a vector or may be incorporated into the genome of the host carrier (for instance, by homologous recombination). In one embodiment of the invention, the attenuated bacterial or viral vaccine carrier is engineered to express a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide, wherein the polynucleotide encoding the HtrA polypeptide is not capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions to a mammalian polynucleotide. For instance, the invention includes an attenuated bacterial or viral carrier that is engineered to express amino acids 1-151 or 1-169 or immunogenic fragments thereof of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6 and/or 8. In one embodiment of the invention, the attenuated bacterial or viral vaccine carrier is engineered to express, for instance, a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of amino acids 1-169 of SEQ ID NO: 2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-151 of SEQ ED \n\n NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; or amino acids 95-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8 or a variant thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide is a Chlamydial HtrA polypeptide that does not include any of about amino acids 170-497 of SEQ ID NO: 2, 6 or 8. In one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide is a Chlamydial HtrA polypeptide that does not include any of about amino acids 151-497 of SEQ ID NO: 2, 6 or 8. [0221] In one embodiment of the invention, the vaccine composition comprises an attenuated Salmonella vaccine carrier comprising an attenuating mutation in a Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 region and, optionally, one or more additional attenuating mutations (for instance, a mutation in one or more of the aroA, aroC or sod genes) and a nucleic acid encoding a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a poxvirus vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide. The attenuated live vaccine compositions of the present ivention can further comprise, for instance, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or adjuvant. See for instance, U.S. Patents 6,342,215; 6,936,425; 6,756,042; and 7,211,264 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n[0222] In certain embodiments of the invention, a polypeptide of the invention is expressed by a poxvirus vaccine carrier (e.g., MVA). In one specific embodiment the poxvirus vector that expresses a polypeptide of the invention is a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) The present invention thus includes compositions comprising a MVA which expresses a Chlamydia HtrA polypeptide. The nucleic acid encoding the HtrA polypeptide may be incorporated into the genome of the viral carrier (for instance, by homologous recombination). In one embodiment of the invention, the attenuated viral vaccine carrier is engineered to express, for instance, a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of amino acids 1-169 of SEQ ID NO: 2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 22-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 17-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 128-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 110-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; amino acids 95- 151 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8; or amino acids 95-169 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6 or 8 or a variant thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide is a Chlamydial HtrA polypeptide that does not include any of about amino acids 170-497 of SEQ ED NO: 2, 6 or 8. In one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide is a Chlamydial HtrA polypeptide that does not include any of about amino acids 151-497 of SEQ ID NO: 2, 6 or 8. \n\n [0223] The polypeptides of the invention can also be administered via liposome carriers, which serve to target the polypeptides to a particular tissue, such as lymphoid tissue, or to target selectively to infected cells, as well as to increase the half-life of the polypeptide composition. Liposomes include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations, the polypeptide to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a molecule which binds to a receptor prevalent among lymphoid cells (such as monoclonal antibodies which bind to the CD45 antigen or other costimulatory factor) or with other therapeutic or immunogenic compositions. Thus, liposomes either filled or decorated with a desired polypeptide of the invention can be directed to the site of lymphoid cells, where the liposomes then deliver the polypeptide compositions. Liposomes for use in accordance with the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size, acid lability and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467 (1980), and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369. A liposome suspension containing a polypeptide of the invention may be administered intravenously, locally, topically, etc. in a dose which varies according to, inter alia, the manner of administration, the polypeptide being delivered, and the stage of the disease being treated.\n\n\n[0224] For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers may be used which include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic composition is formed by incorporating any of the normally employed excipients, such as those carriers previously listed, and generally 10-95% of active ingredient, that is, one or more polypeptides of the invention, often at a concentration of 25%-75%.\n\n\n[0225] For aerosol or mucosal administration, the immunogenic polypeptides can be supplied in finely divided form, optionally along with a surfactant and, propellant and/or a mucoadhesive, e.g., chitosan. Typical percentages of polypeptides are 0.01%-20% by weight, often l%-10%. The surfactant must, of course, be pharmaceutically acceptable, and in some embodiments soluble in the propellant. Representative of such agents are the esters or partial esters of fatty acids containing from 6 to 22 carbon atoms, such as caproic, octanoic, lauric, palmitic, stearic, \n\n linoleic, linolenic, olesteric and oleic acids with an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or its cyclic anhydride. Mixed esters, such as mixed or natural glycerides may be employed. The surfactant may constitute 0.1%-20% by weight of the composition, in some embodiments 0.25-5% by weight. The balance of the composition is ordinarily propellant, although an atomizer may be used in which no propellant is necessary and other percentages are adjusted accordingly. In some embodiments, the immunogenic polypeptides can be incorporated within an aerodynamically light particle, such as those particles described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,942,868 or U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0008633. A carrier can also be included, e.g., lecithin for intranasal delivery. [0226] hi some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a multivalent vaccine. For example, a multivalent vaccine of the present invention can comprise a polypeptide at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to C. trachomatis HtrA sequences, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants described herein, e.g., in Tables 3-8 or any combinations of sequences thereof, wherein the polypeptide when administered to a subject in need thereof in a sufficient amount, induces an immune response against Chlamydia sp. and a polypeptide that elicits an immune reaction to one or more additional organisms and/or viruses, e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis C virus, , Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Clostridium tetani, Polio virus, Influenza virus, Rubeola virus, Rubella virus, myxovirus, Neisseria, e.g., N. gonnorrheae, Haemophilus ducrey, Granuloma inguinale, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, human papilloma virus (HPV) type I and II, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Treponema pallidum, Poxvirus of the Molluscipox virus genus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, or other Chlamydia species.\n\n\n[0227] In some embodiments, the multivalent vaccine of the present invention can comprise a polypeptide of the present invention and a compatible vaccine, wherein both the vaccine of the present invention and the compatible vaccine are targeted for a similar patient population, e.g., an adolescent population. Examples of multivalent vaccines targeted for a specific patient population include, but are not limited to a vaccine for administration to an adolescent comprising a polypeptide of the present invention and a polypeptide that elicits an immune response to one or more of Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Neisseria, e.g., N. gonorrheae, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, or other Chlamydia species. \n\n Polynucleotide Vaccines\n\n\n[0228] In some embodiments, the present invention is also directed to a polynucleotide vaccine. The term \"DNA vaccine\" or \"polynucleotide vaccine\" refers to a composition comprising the polypeptides of the present invention which when administered to an animal, e.g., in a viral vector, express one or more polypeptides of the present invention in the cells of the animal, thereby stimulating an immune response against Chlamydia infection.\n\n\n[0229] Such polynucleotide vaccine compositions can include those adjuvants, carriers, excipients, or modes of administration listed herein for polypeptide vaccines. In some embodiments, if the adjuvant, carrier, or excipient is a polypeptide, the polynucleotide vaccine composition can comprise a nucleic acid fragment which encodes the adjuvant, carrier or excipient polypeptide. Polynucleotide vaccine compositions can also include, for example, naked DNA, DNA formulated with PVP, DNA in cationic lipid formulations; DNA encapsulated e.g., in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (\"PLG\") microspheres {see, e.g., Eldridge, et al, Molec.

W. et al, In: Concepts in vaccine development, Kaufmann, S. H. E., ed., p. 423, 1996; Cease, K. B., and Berzofsky, J. A., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:923, 1994 and Eldridge, J. H. et al, Sem. Hematol 30:16, 1993), etc.\n\n\n[0230] The present invention provides compositions comprising a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide with at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to C. trachomatis HtrA sequences, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants described herein. For example, the present invention includes a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid encoding amino acids 1-151 or 1-169 of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6 or 8 or fragments thereof. A polynucleotide-based vaccine, or polynucleotide vaccine, of the present invention is capable of eliciting, without more, an immune response in an animal against a Chlamydia species, e.g., C. trachomatis, when administered to that animal.\n\n\n[0231] Polynucleotide-based vaccines compositions of the invention include nucleic acid- mediated modalities. DNA or RNA encoding one or more of the polypeptides of the invention \n\n can also be administered to a patient. This approach is described, for instance, in Wolff et. al, Science 247: 1465 (1990) as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 5,580,859; 5,589,466; 5,804,566; 5,739,118; 5,736,524; 5,679,647; WO 98/04720; and in more detail below. Examples of DNA- based delivery technologies include \"naked DNA,\" facilitated (bupivicaine, polymers, peptide- mediated) delivery, cationic lipid complexes, and particle-mediated (\"gene gun\") or pressure- mediated delivery {see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,922,687).\n\n\n[0232] In some embodiments, the polynucleotide-based vaccines are prepared and administered in such a manner that the encoded gene products are optimally expressed in the particular animal to which the composition is administered. As a result, these compositions and methods are useful in stimulating an immune response against Chlamydia infection as the coding sequence encodes a polypeptide which stimulates the immune system to respond to Chlamydia infection. Also included in the invention are expression systems, delivery systems, and codon-optimized Chlamydia coding sequences, e.g., viral vectors. Vaccinia vectors and methods useful in immunization protocols are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,722,848. Another vector is BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin). BCG vectors are described in Stover et al., Nature 557:456-460 (1991). A wide variety of other vectors useful for therapeutic administration or immunization of the polypeptides of the invention, e.g. adeno and adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, Salmonella typhi vectors, detoxified anthrax toxin vectors, and the like, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the description herein.\n\n\n[0233] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides are complexed in a liposome preparation (Feigner et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 54:74137416 (1987); Malone et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 56:60776081 (1989)). Furthermore, polynucleotide -vaccine compositions of the present invention may include one or more transfection facilitating compounds that facilitate delivery of polynucleotides to the interior of a cell, and/or to a desired location within a cell. [0234] In other embodiments, the polynucleotide itself may function as an adjuvant as is the case when the polynucleotides of the invention are derived, in whole or in part, from bacterial DNA. Bacterial DNA containing motifs of unmethylated CpG-dinucleotides (CpG-DNA) triggers innate immune cells in animals through a pattern recognition receptor (including toll receptors such as TLR 9) and thus possesses potent immunostimulatory effects on macrophages, dendritic cells and B-lymphocytes. See, e.g., Wagner, H., Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 5:62-69 (2002); Jung, J. et al, J. Immunol. 169: 2368-73 (2002); see also Klinman, D.M. et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:2879-83 (1996). Methods of using unmethylated CpG-dinucleotides as adjuvants \n\n are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,207,646, 6,406,705, and 6,429,199, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n[0235] Compositions comprising polynucleotides of the present invention may include various salts, excipients, delivery vehicles and/or auxiliary agents as are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 6,875,748, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n[0236] Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by injection, either subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intranasally, intramuscularly, intravaginal, or intrarectal delivered to the interstitial space of a tissue, or administered to a mucosal surface, for example, intranasally. The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Other modes of administration include oral and pulmonary administration, suppositories, and transdermal or transcutaneous applications. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule.\n\n\nMethods of Treatment/Prevention and Regimens\n\n\n[0237] Also provided is a method to treat or prevent a Chlamydia infection in a subject comprising: administering to the animal in need thereof a composition containing any one or more of the polypeptides, polynucleotides, vectors, or host cells of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the subject is a vertebrate, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. Pn some embodiments, the invention is directed to a method of inducing an immune response against Chlamydia in a subject, e.g., a host animal comprising administering an effective amount a composition containing any one or more of the polypeptides, polynucleotides, vectors, or host cells of the present invention.\n\n\n[0238] In some embodiments, an animal can be treated with the compositions, polypeptides, polynucleotides, vectors, or host cells prophylactically, e.g., as a prophylactic vaccine, to establish or enhance immunity to one or more Chlamydia species, e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia pneumoniae, in a healthy animal prior to exposure to Chlamydia or contraction of a Chlamydia symptom, thus preventing the disease or reducing the severity of disease symptoms. One or more compositions, polypeptides, polynucleotides, vectors, or host cells of the present invention may also be used to treat an animal already exposed to Chlamydia, or already suffering from Chlamydia-velated symptom to further stimulate the immune system of the animal, thus reducing or eliminating the symptoms associated with that exposure. As defined herein, \"treatment of an animal\" refers to the use of one or more compositions, polypeptides, polynucleotides, vectors, or host cells of the present invention to prevent, cure, retard, or reduce \n\n the severity of Chlamydia symptoms in an animal, and/or result in no worsening of Chlamydia symptoms over a specified period of time. It is not required that any composition, polypeptide, polynucleotide, a vector, or a host cell of the present invention provides total protection against Chlamydia infection or totally cure or eliminate all Chlamydia symptoms. As used herein, \"an animal in need of therapeutic and/or preventative immunity\" refers to an animal which it is desirable to treat, i.e., to prevent, cure, retard, or reduce the severity of Chlamydia symptoms, and/or result in no worsening of Chlamydia symptoms over a specified period of time. [0239] In some embodiments, an antibody specifically reactive with a Chlamydia organism is isolated from the serum of the host animal which has been administered a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention. In some embodiments, the invention is directed to a method of providing passive immunity comprising administering the antibody specifically reactive with a Chlamydia organism (which was isolated from the serum of a host animal) to an animal in need thereof.\n\n\n[0240] Treatment with pharmaceutical compositions comprising the immunogenic compositions, polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present inventions can occur separately or in conjunction with other treatments, as appropriate.\n\n\n[0241] In therapeutic applications, compositions, polypeptides or polynucleotides are administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective CTL response to the Chlamydia-deήved polypeptide to cure or at least partially arrest symptoms and/or complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective dose\" or \"unit dose.\" Amounts effective for this use will depend on, e.g., the polypeptide or polynucleotide composition, the manner of administration, the stage and severity of the disease being treated, the weight and general state of health of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician, but generally range for the initial immunization for polypeptide vaccines is (that is for therapeutic or prophylactic administration) from about 1.0 μg to about 5000 μg of polypeptide, in some embodiments about 10 μg to about 30 μg, for a 70 kg patient, followed by boosting dosages of from about 1.0 μg to about 1000 μg, in some embodiments 10 μg to about 30 μg, of polypeptide pursuant to a boosting regimen over weeks to months depending upon the patient's response and condition by measuring specific CTL activity in the patient's blood. In alternative embodiments, generally for humans the dose range for the initial immunization (that is for therapeutic or prophylactic administration) is from about 1.0 μg to about 20,000 μg of polypeptide for a 70 kg patient, in some embodiments 2 μg -, 5 μg - 10 μg -, 15 μg -, 20 μg -, 25 μg -, 30 μg -, 40 μg -, or 50 μg -2000 μg, followed by boosting dosages in the same dose range \n\n pursuant to a boosting regimen over weeks to months depending upon the patient's response and condition by measuring specific CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) activity in the patient's blood. In a specific, non-limiting embodiment of the invention, approximately 0.01 to 2000 μg, or in some embodiments 2 μg to 200 μg or 10 μg to 30 μg, of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention, or its fragment, derivative variant, or analog is administered to a host. [0242] In embodiments where DNA vaccine administration is used, the amount of polynucleotide in the initial immunization (that is for therapeutic or prophylactic administration) depends upon a number of factors including, for example, the antigen being expressed, the expression vector being used, the age and weight of the subject, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. Based on the above factors, determining the precise amount, number of doses, and timing of doses are within the ordinary skill in the art and will be readily determined by the attending physician or veterinarian. In some embodiments, doses for nucleic acids encoding polypeptides range from about 10 ng to 1 g, 100 ng to 100 mg, 1 μg to 10 mg, or 30-300 μg DNA or RNA per patient.\n\n\n[0243] In non-limiting embodiments of the invention, an effective amount of a composition of the invention produces an elevation of antibody titer to at least three times the antibody titer prior to administration.\n\n\n[0244] It must be kept in mind that the polypeptides and compositions of the present invention may generally be employed in serious disease states, that is, life-threatening or potentially life threatening situations. In such cases, in view of the minimization of extraneous substances and the relative nontoxic nature of the polypeptides, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer substantial excesses of these polypeptide compositions. [0245] For therapeutic use, administration should begin at the first sign of Chlamydia infection. This is followed by boosting doses until at least symptoms are substantially abated and for a period thereafter. In chronic infection, loading doses followed by boosting doses may be required.\n\n\n[0246] Treatment of an infected individual with the compositions of the invention may hasten resolution of the infection in acutely infected individuals. For those individuals susceptible (or predisposed) to developing chronic infection the compositions are particularly useful in methods for preventing the evolution from acute to chronic infection. Where the susceptible individuals are identified prior to or during infection, for instance, as described herein, the composition can be targeted to them, minimizing need for administration to a larger population. \n\n [0247] More specifically, the compositions of the present invention may be administered to any tissue of an animal, including, but not limited to, muscle, skin, brain tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, spleen tissue, bone marrow tissue, thymus tissue, heart tissue, e.g., myocardium, endocardium, and pericardium, lymph tissue, blood tissue, bone tissue, pancreas tissue, kidney tissue, gall bladder tissue, stomach tissue, intestinal tissue, testicular tissue, ovarian tissue, uterine tissue, vaginal tissue, rectal tissue, nervous system tissue, eye tissue, glandular tissue, tongue tissue, and connective tissue, e.g., cartilage.\n\n\n[0248] Furthermore, the compositions of the present invention may be administered to any internal cavity of a vertebrate, including, but not limited to, the lungs, the mouth, the nasal cavity, the stomach, the peritoneal cavity, the intestine, any heart chamber, veins, arteries, capillaries, lymphatic cavities, the uterine cavity, the vaginal cavity, the rectal cavity, joint cavities, ventricles in brain, spinal canal in spinal cord, the ocular cavities, the lumen of a duct of a salivary gland or a liver. When the compositions of the present invention is administered to the lumen of a duct of a salivary gland or a liver, the desired polypeptide is encoded in each of the salivary gland and the liver such that the polypeptide is delivered into the blood stream of the vertebrate from each of the salivary gland and the liver. Certain modes for administration to secretory organs of a gastrointestinal system using the salivary gland, liver and pancreas to release a desired polypeptide into the bloodstream is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,837,693 and 6,004,944, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. [0249] In one embodiment, the compositions are administered to muscle, either skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle, or lung tissue. Specific, but non-limiting modes for administration to lung tissue are disclosed in Wheeler, C.J., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. USA 93:11454-11459 (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n[0250] In certain embodiments, one or more compositions of the present invention are delivered to an animal by methods described herein, thereby achieving an effective immune response, and/or an effective therapeutic or preventative immune response. Any mode of administration can be used so long as the mode results in the delivery and/or expression of the desired polypeptide in the desired tissue, in an amount sufficient to generate an immune response to Chlamydia, e.g., C. trachomatis, and/or to generate a prophylactically or therapeutically effective immune response to Chlamydia, e.g., C. trachomatis, in an animal in need of such response. According to the disclosed methods, compositions of the present invention can be administered by mucosal delivery, transdermal delivery, subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection, oral administration, pulmonary administration, intramuscular (i.m.) administration, or via intradural \n\n injection. Other suitable routes of administration include, but not limited to intratracheal, transdermal, intraocular, intranasal, inhalation, intracavity, intraductal (e.g., into the pancreas) and intraparenchymal (i.e., into any tissue) administration. Transdermal delivery includes, but not limited to intradermal (e.g., into the dermis or epidermis), transdermal (e.g., percutaneous) and transmucosal administration (i.e., into or through skin or mucosal tissue). Intracavity administration includes, but not limited to administration into oral, vaginal, rectal, nasal, peritoneal, or intestinal cavities as well as, intrathecal (i.e., into spinal canal), intraventricular (i.e., into the brain ventricles or the heart ventricles), intraatrial (i.e., into the heart atrium) and sub arachnoid (i.e., into the sub arachnoid spaces of the brain) administration. [0251] Any mode of administration can be used so long as the mode results in the delivery and/or expression of the desired polypeptide in the desired tissue, in an amount sufficient to generate an immune response to Chlamydia, e.g., C. trachomatis, and/or to generate a prophylactically or therapeutically effective immune response to Chlamydia, e.g., C. trachomatis, in an animal in need of such response. Administration means of the present invention include needle injection, catheter infusion, biolistic injectors, particle accelerators (e.g., \"gene guns\" or pneumatic \"needleless\" injectors) Med-E-Jet (Vahlsing, H., et ah, J. Immunol. Methods 171,11- 22 (1994)), Pigjet (Schrijver, R., et al, Vaccine 15, 1908-1916 (1997)), Biojector (Davis, H., et al, Vaccine 12, 1503-1509 (1994); Gramzinski, R., et al, MoI. Med. 4, 109-118 (1998)), AdvantaJet (Linmayer, L, et al, Diabetes Care 9:294-297 (1986)), Medi-jector (Martins, J., and Roedl, E. J. Occup. Med. 27:821-824 (1979)), gelfoam sponge depots, other commercially available depot materials (e.g., hydrogels), osmotic pumps (e.g., Alza minipumps), oral or suppositorial solid (tablet or pill) pharmaceutical formulations, topical skin creams, and decanting, use of polynucleotide coated suture (Qin, Y., et al, Life Sciences 65, 2193-2203 (1999)) or topical applications during surgery. Certain modes of administration are intramuscular needle-based injection and pulmonary application via catheter infusion. Each of the references cited in this paragraph is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [0252] Upon immunization with a polypeptide or polynucleotide composition in accordance with the invention, the immune system of the host responds to the vaccine by producing large amounts of HTLs (helper T lymphocytes) and/or CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) specific for the desired antigen. Consequently, the host becomes at least partially immune to later infection, or at least partially resistant to developing an ongoing chronic infection.\n\n\n[0253] In some embodiments, polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention stimulate a cell-mediated immune response sufficient for protection of an animal against \n\n Chlamydia infection. In other embodiments, polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention stimulate both a humoral and a cell-mediated response, the combination of which is sufficient for protection of an animal against Chlamydia protection.\n\n\n[0254] In certain embodiments, components that induce T cell responses are combined with components that induce antibody responses to the target antigen of interest. Thus, in certain embodiments of the invention, vaccine compositions of the invention are combined with polypeptides or polynucleotides which induce or facilitate neutralizing antibody responses to the target antigen of interest. One embodiment of such a composition comprises a class I epitope in accordance with the invention, along with a PADRE\n®\n (Epimmune, San Diego, CA) molecule (described, for example, in U.S. Patent Number 5,736,142, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.).\n\n\n[0255] The polynucleotides of the present invention, or vectors containing the polynucleotides of the present invention, can be incorporated into the cells of the animal in vivo, and an antigenic amount of the C. trachomatis-deήved polypeptide, or fragments, variants, or derivatives thereof, is produced in vivo. Upon administration of the composition according to this method, the C. trachomatis -deny ed polypeptide is expressed in the animal in an amount sufficient to elicit an immune response. Such an immune response might be used, for example, to generate antibodies to C. trachomatis for use in diagnostic assays or as laboratory reagents.\n\n\n[0256] The present invention further provides a method for generating, enhancing, or modulating a protective and/or therapeutic immune response to C. trachomatis in an animal, comprising administering to the animal in need of therapeutic and/or preventative immunity one or more of the compositions described herein. In some embodiments, the composition includes an isolated polynucleotide comprising a codon-optimized coding region encoding a polypeptide of the present invention, optimized for expression in a given host organism, e.g., a human, or a nucleic acid fragment of such a coding region encoding a fragment, variant, or derivative thereof. The polynucleotides are incorporated into the cells of the animal in vivo, and an immunologically effective amount of the C. trachomatis polypeptide, or fragment or variant is produced in vivo. Upon administration of the composition according to this method, the C. trachomatis-deήved polypeptide is expressed in the animal in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount. [0257] The compositions of the present invention can be administered to an animal at any time during the lifecycle of the animal to which it is being administered. For example, the composition can be given shortly after birth. In humans, administration of the composition of the present invention can occur while other vaccines are being administered, e.g., at birth, 2 months, \n\n 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, at 1 year, at 5 years, or at the onset of puberty. In some embodiments, administration of the composition of the present invention can occur when the human become sexually active.\n\n\n[0258] Furthermore, the compositions of the invention can be used in any desired immunization or administration regimen; e.g., in a single administration or alternatively as part of periodic vaccinations such as annual vaccinations, or as in a prime-boost regime wherein the polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention is administered either before or after the administration of the same or of a different polypeptide or polynucleotide.\n\n\n[0259] Recent studies have indicated that a prime-boost protocol is often a suitable method of administering vaccines. In a prime-boost protocol, one or more compositions of the present invention can be utilized in a \"prime boost\" regimen. An example of a \"prime boost\" regimen may be found in Yang, Z. et al. J. Virol. 77:799-803 (2002), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a non-limiting example, one or more polynucleotide vaccine compositions of the present invention are delivered to an animal, thereby priming the immune response of the animal to a Chlamydia polypeptide of the invention, and then a second immunogenic composition is utilized as a boost vaccination. One or more compositions of the present invention are used to prime immunity, and then a second immunogenic composition, e.g., a recombinant viral vaccine or vaccines, e.g., a recombinant vaccine virus, e.g., a recombinant MVA vaccinia virus, a different polynucleotide vaccine, or one or more purified subunit of the Chlamydia polypeptides or fragments, variants or derivatives thereof is used to boost the anti- Chlamydia immune response.\n\n\n[0260] In another non-limiting example, a priming composition and a boosting composition are combined in a single composition or single formulation. For example, a single composition may comprise an isolated Chlamydia polypeptide or a fragment, variant, or derivative thereof as the priming component and a polynucleotide encoding a Chlamydia polypeptide as the boosting component. In this embodiment, the compositions may be contained in a single vial where the priming component and boosting component are mixed together. In general, because the peak levels of expression of polypeptide from the polynucleotide does not occur until later (e.g., 7-10 days) after administration, the polynucleotide component may provide a boost to the isolated polypeptide component. Compositions comprising both a priming component and a boosting component are referred to herein as \"combinatorial vaccine compositions\" or \"single formulation heterologous prime-boost vaccine compositions.\" In addition, the priming composition may be \n\n administered before the boosting composition, or even after the boosting composition, if the boosting composition is expected to take longer to act.\n\n\n[0261] In another embodiment, the priming composition may be administered simultaneously with the boosting composition, but in separate formulations where the priming component and the boosting component are separated.\n\n\nKits\n\n\n[0262] The polypeptide or polynucleotide vaccine compositions of this invention can be provided in kit form together with a means for administering the polypeptide, polynucleotide, or composition of the present invention, hi some embodiments, the kit can further comprise instructions for vaccine administration.\n\n\n[0263] Typically the kit would include desired composition(s) of the invention in a container, e.g., in unit dosage form and instructions for administration. Means for administering the composition of the present invention can include, for example, a sterile syringe, an aerosol applicator {e.g., an inhaler or any other means of nasal or pulmonary administration), a gel, a cream, a transdermal patch, transmucosal patch (or any other means of buccal or sublingual administration), or an oral tablet. In some embodiments, the kit of the present invention contains two or more means for administering the polypeptides, polynucleotides, vectors, or compositions of the present inventions, e.g., two or more syringes.\n\n\n[0264] In some embodiments, the kit may comprise more than one container comprising the polypeptide, polynucleotide, or composition of the present invention. For example, in some embodiments the kit may comprise a container containing a priming component of the present invention, and a separate container comprising the boosting component of the present invention. [0265] Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice or printed instructions. For example, such printed instructions can be in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of the manufacture, use or sale for human administration of the present invention. \"Printed instructions\" can be, for example, one of a book, booklet, brochure or leaflet.\n\n\n[0266] The kit can also include a storage unit for storing the components {e.g., means of administering, containers comprising the polypeptides, polynucleotides, or compositions of the present inventions, printed instructions, etc.) of the kit. The storage unit can be, for example, a bag, box, envelope or any other container that would be suitable for use in the present invention. \n\n Preferably, the storage unit is large enough to accommodate each component that may be necessary for administering the methods of the present invention.\n\n\n[0267] The present invention can also include a method of delivering a polypeptide, polynucleotide, or composition of the present invention to an animal such as a human in need thereof, the method comprising (a) registering in a computer readable medium the identity of an administrator (e.g., a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, veterinarian) permitted to administer the polypeptide, polynucleotide, vector, or composition of the present invention; (b) providing the human with counseling information concerning the risks attendant the polypeptide, polynucleotide, vector, or composition of the present invention; (c) obtaining informed consent from the human to receive the polypeptide, polynucleotide, vector, or composition of the present invention despite the attendant risks; and (e) permitting the human access to the polypeptide, polynucleotide, vector, or composition of the present invention. Immunoassays\n\n\n[0268] The present invention includes a method of detecting Chlamydia in a test sample. In certain embodiments, the presence of Chlamydia species can be detected by contacting the test sample with the antibody against C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides, fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof to form antigen: antibody immunocomplexes and further detecting the presence of or measuring the amount of said immunocomplexes formed during the step. The present invention also provides assays for detecting or measuring an immune response to C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides of the present invention. In some embodiments, the immune response of an organism can be determined by comparing the sera from an organism that is unvaccinated, or that has not been exposed to an antigen originating from Chlamydia (preimmune sera), to the sera from an organism that has been vaccinated, or that has been exposed to an antigen originating from Chlamydia (immune sera). As used herein, \"a detectable immune response\" refers to an immunogenic response to the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, which can be measured or observed by standard protocols. For example, the immune response can be either antibody response or T-cell response. Thus, the present invention provides a method of detecting antibodies against Chlamydia in a test sample comprising the steps of contacting the test sample with C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides to form antigen: antibody immunocomplexes, and further detecting the presence of or measuring the amount of the immunocomplexes formed during the step. The present invention also provides a method for determining the presence of nucleic acids of Chlamydia sp. in a test sample, comprising the steps of contacting the test sample with the polynucleotide described herein or \n\n complement sequence thereof to produce duplexes and determining the production of duplexes. The test sample can be a patient specimen, e.g., tissues, blood, serum, saliva, mucous, and any organs or the patient itself.\n\n\n[0269] Standard protocols for detecting an immune response include, but are not limited to, immunoblot analysis (western), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \"sandwich\" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation analysis, cytolytic T-cell response, ELISPOT, and chromium release assay. An immune response may also be \"detected\" through challenge of immunized animals with a virulent Chlamydia species, either before or after vaccination. Standard chromium release assays are used to measure specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against the Chlamydia antigens. More sensitive techniques such as the ELISPOT assay, intracellular cytokine staining, and tetramer staining have become available in the art to determine lymphocyte antigen responsiveness. It is estimated that these newer methods are 10- to 100-fold more sensitive than the common CTL and HTL assays (Murali-Krishna eϊ al, Immunity, 8:177-87 (1998)), because the traditional methods measure only the subset of T cells that can proliferate in vitro, and may, in fact, be representative of only a fraction of the memory T cell compartment (Ogg G. S., McMichael AJ., Curr Opin Immunol, 10:393-6 (1998)).\n\n\n[0270] Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, e.g., polypeptides of the present invention, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel {e.g., 8%- 20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution {e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer {e.g., PBS-TWEEN 20™), blocking the membrane with primary antibody, e.g., serum from vaccinated individuals, preimmune sera and control positive antibodies, diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti- human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate {e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule {e.g., \n32\nP or \n125\nI) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise.

Then a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well, wherein the second antibody is conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art.

Primers used for PCR amplification included synthetic restriction sites, N col, shown underlined in the forward primer, SEQ ID NO: 9, and Sail, shown underlined in the reverse primer, SEQ ID NO: 10. The reverse primer further included an artificial sequence coding 6 histidine residues, to facilitate detection and purification of the recombinant protein.\n\n\n[0277] SEQ ID No. 9: CCCGG CCATGG TG AAA AGA TTA TGT GTG TTG\n\n\n[0278] SEQ ID No. 10: CCGGGGTCGAC CTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG CTC GTC TGA TTT CAA GAC GAT GAA\n\n\n[0279] The amplification product was 1500 bp. After purification using a PCR column, the amplification product, containing a C. trachomatis HtrA gene, and also expression vector pET- 28a(+) were digested with Ncol and Sail restriction enzymes and purified using agarose gel. The digested cloned C. trachomatis HtrA gene and pET-28a(+) vector were then ligated using T4 ligase. After ligation, the recombinant expression construct was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells for clone selection. Antibiotic-resistant clones were picked at random and screened for the presence of HtrA-encoding inserts in the proper orientation for expression by conventional restriction endonuclease digestion.\n\n\n[0280] To confirm successful expression of recombinant HtrA, BL21 (DE3) cells with or without pET28 constructs were cultured in LB medium at 37\n0\nC for 5 hours. The cell cultures were then induced with 1 mmol IPTG for an additional 5 hours. The cells were collected and IPTG-inducible expressed proteins and separated based on molecular size by SDS-PAGE using commercially available NuPAGE™ gels. The proteins were then transferred to cellulose membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis. Figure 4(A) shows the Western Blot of C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide purified from E.coli BL21 cells using anti-PentaHis monoclonal antibody. Aliquots from two lots of purified recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA from the E.coli strain BL21 (DE3) (pET28-CtHtrA/L2) were electrophoresed in a 4-12% NuPAGE™ (Novex) gel, electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit anti- PentaHis monoclonal sera as the primary antibody (1/5,000 dilution) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and \n\n a goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-labelled secondary antibody (1/1,000 dilution) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\n\n\n[0281] The sequence of the pET28 construct was determined using an AB310 sequencer with the following primers:\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:11 : HtrA 1, forward ATGATGAAAAGATTATTA SEQ ID NO: 12: HtrA 500, forward TAGATCCAAAAACAGA SEQ ID NO: 13: HtrA 1060, forward AAGTAGAGTCTTTGAGTG SEQ ID NO: 14: HtrA 200, reverse ATATACAACTCCAGGCGT SEQ ID NO: 15: HtrA 550, reverse AAATGGTAATTTCTCCGC SEQ ID NO: 16: HtrA 1090, reverse GGAAATGGCATTACGCAA SEQ ID NO: 17 HtrA 1490, reverse CTACTCGTCTGATTTCAA\n\n\n[0282] The sequence of the HtrA gene inserted in pET28 contained 1494 bp and is shown without the added 6 histidine tag as SEQ ID NO:1. The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame is shown without the added 6 histidine tag as SEQ ID NO:2. The nucleotide sequence of the HtrA chimeric containing 6 histidine tag is shown as SEQ ID NO:3, and the corresponding deduced amino acid sequence as SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\n[0283] To further characterize the expressed product, recombinant 6 histidine tagged C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptide was purified from E. coli culture, subject to SDS-PAGE analysis and assayed for viable protease activity. Cell pellet from a 250 ml culture was resuspended in 20 ml 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 8 M urea, and lysed by sonification. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 x g, 30 min, 4\n0\nC. Supernatant containing recombinant HtrA polypeptides was loaded at 5.0 ml/min onto a 5 ml HITRAP™ chelate column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 8 M urea, 10 mM imidazole, washed with 6 column volumes of equilibration buffer, then further washed with three column volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and, finally, eluted with a 200 mM imidazole step gradient. Elution fractions of approximately 2.5 ml were collected and applied to a NuP AGE™ gel. [0284] Figure 4(B) shows protease activity of recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA in a zymograph gels. An aliquot of purified recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA from the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (pET28-CtHtrA/L2) was electrophoresed in a 4-16% BlueCasein zymogram gel (Novex) and developed overnight at 37°C according to the manufacturers instructions. Recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA degradation (i.e. proteolysis) of the blue casein substrate is visualized as a zone of clearing at ~ 49kDa. \n\n -I l l-\n\n\nExample 2: Purification of recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides for use in vaccine compositions\n\n\n[0285] Recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA polypeptides were expressed in BL21 E. coli cells with expression vector pET28 as described in Example 1. Cell paste (3 g) was suspended in 60 ml 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and sonicated at 50% duty cycle for 2 min on ice. Lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 20 min at 4\n0\nC. Supernatant containing recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA was filtered with a 0.2 μM filter and applied at 1.5 ml/min in 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, to a Ni-chelating column equilibrated with three column volumes of 25 mM Tris, pH8.0, containing 200 mM imidazole and again with three column volumes of 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The column was washed with seven column volumes of 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 20 mM imidazole, and eluted with 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 200 mM imidazole. Elution fractions of 2.0 ml were collected. Recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA eluted in fractions #4 through #7. [0286] Ni-chelate elution fractions #4 through #7 were pooled, an equal volume added of 25 mM Na-acetate, pH 5.2, and pH adjusted to 5.2 using IM HCl. This material was further purified by cation exchange using an HI-TRAP™ 1 ml column. Sample was applied at 1 ml/min to a column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 200 mM imidazole, washed with six column volumes 25 mM Na-acetate, pH 5.2, and eluted at 1 ml/min with a step gradient at 35% of 25 mM Na-acetate, pH 5.2, containing IM NaCl for 10 ml followed by a linear gradient of 36- 100% in 30 ml. Low molecular weight impurities elute at the step gradient, while recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA elutes in the linear gradient.\n\n\n[0287] Residual host cell endotoxin was removed by centrifugation. A sufficient quantity of chilled stock of 10% Triton X-114 in water was added to HI- TRAP™ eluates to reach final concentration about 2.5% Triton. The sample was allowed to stand on ice for 30 min, agitated once every 10 min, then warmed to room temperature. The sample was then centrifuged at room temperature at 17,000 x g for 15 min in 1.5 ml EPPENDORF ™ tubes or at 20,000 x g for 20 min in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Clear supernatant containing recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA was dialysed once for three hours and once overnight against 100 X volume of water.\n\n\n[0288] Total protein was determined using a micro BCA protein assay. Endotoxin content was measured using a commercial spectropohotometric LAL endotoxin assay (Cape Code Associates). After endotoxin removal, the recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA preparations are substantially purified, at lest about 95% pure by weight (Data not shown. \n\n [0289] Figure 4(C) shows Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA samples suitable for use in vaccine compositions. Lane 1 is MARK-12 \nM\n molecular weight standards. Lane 2 is 4.2μg HtrA. Lane 3 is 5.0μg HtrA. [0290] For Western blots, aliquots of purified HtrA were rehydrated in sample buffer, 6% BME, loaded on NuPAGE ™ gels and run 40 min at 200V. The NuP AGE™ gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane which was incubated 1 hour at room temperature in blocking buffer consisting of 1% BSA in IX TBS prior to immunostaining. The membrane was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with agitation in first antibody, K306, a polyclonal rabbit anti-serum raised against recombinant C. pneumoniae HtrA prepared previously, at 1 :50,000 dilution in blocking buffer. The membrane was washed in three 5 min washes in IX TBS. After washing, a second antibody was added, alkaline-phosphatase labeled goat-anti-rabbit serum, at 1 :1,000 dilution in blocking buffer. This solution was agitated 1 hour at room temperature, then subject to the same wash procedure. After final wash, the membrane was incubated in alkaline- phosphatase substrate for 10-15 minutes.\n\n\n[0291] Figure 4(D) shows a Western blot using rabbit polyclonal serum raised against C. pneumoniae HtrA. Aliquots from two lots of purified recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA from the E.coli strain BL21 (DE3) (pET28-CtHtrA/L2) were electrophoresed in a 4-12% NuPAGETM (Novex) gel, electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit anύ-Chlamydia pneumoniae polyclonal sera (K306) as the primary antibody (1/50,000 dilution) and a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphate-labelled secondary antibody (1/1,000 dilution). Lane 1 is SEEBLUE™ molecular weight standards. Lane 2 is recombinant C. trachomatis 4.2 μg HtrA and Lane 3 is 5.0 μg of recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA.\n\n\nExample 3 : Cellular immune response to recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA\n\n\n[0292] C. trachomatis E serovar EBs for use in immunization and challenge experiments were prepared as stock solutions and stored at -80\n0\nC. Infected cell cultures grown in culture flasks were ruptured by sonication and a supernatant enriched in EBs obtained by centrifugation of cell lysate for 500 x g for 15 minutes at 4\n0\nC. The EB enriched supernatant was further purified by renografin (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium) density gradient centrifugation. An aliquot (2 ml) of EB enriched supernatant was gently added to the top of an 11 ml renografin gradient (2.5 ml of 54%, 4 ml of 44% and 1.5 ml of 40%) and centrifuged at 4°C 1 hr at 18,000 x g in a SORV ALL™ OTD65B rotor. The EB-enriched layer usually between 44-54% renografin \n\n was collected, washed with PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 4\n0\nC for 30 min at 13,000 x g in a SORV ALL™ RC5C rotor. The EB stock solution consisted of this pellet resuspended in 1.5 ml of SPG buffer (22OmM sucrose, 4 mM potassium phosphate, 9 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM L-glutamic acid, pH 7.5) by brief sonication. Inclusion forming units (IFU) were determined per volume of live EB stock solution, or per vaginal swab experimental sample, using an in vitro cell infectivity assay employing McCoy cells. Monolayers of McCoy cells were grown in 96-well plates overnight at 37° C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-IO. Culture medium was discarded and monolayers pre-treated for 20 minutes with 200 μl of DEAE-dextran in Hanks' balanced salt solution. This solution was discarded and aliquots of about 50 μl diluted EB stock or vaginal swab samples in SPG buffer were added. Plates were agitated by tilting every 20 minutes and cultured for two hours at 37° C. EB or vaginal swab samples were then removed, and replaced with 200 μl DMEM- 10 with 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide. Plates were incubated 1 to 2 days at 37° C. Culture medium was discarded and plates gently washed once with PBS. An aliquot of 100 μl of 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol was then added. Killed cells were washed with PBS. An aliquot of 100 μl of primary antibody, mouse anti-C trachomatis serum at 1:100 dilution, was added and cells incubated for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4° C. Cells were again washed with PBS. An aliquot of 50 μl of secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1 :200 dilution, was added and cells incubated for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4° C. Cells were again washed with PBS. An aliquot of 50 μl of substrate composed of PBS with 0.1% chloro-napthol in methanol was added. The substrate was removed and cells again washed with PBS. Stained C. trachomatis inclusion bodies were counted in five fields using light microscopy. IFU were determined as an extrapolation from the average count across five fields.\n\n\n[0293] Immunogenic activity of recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA was evaluated in female C3H/HeOuJ mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks. All mice used in the study were tagged and bled 5 days before immunization. Groups of 10 mice were immunized three times with either 10 μg recombinant HtrA, 50 μg recombinant HtrA, or either 10 μg or 50 μg recombinant HtrA and 5 μg of mLT (used as an adjuvant candidate). Groups of 10 control mice were immunized three times with either PBS or live elementary bodies from C. trachomatis serovar E as controls. [0294] All immunizations were intranasal with a total volume of 20 μl /dose. Mice in each experimental and control group were immunized on day 0, 14 and 22 of the study. Mice were \n\n non-fatally bled on day 21 and day 26, and serum samples stored at -20\n0\nC. Mouse vaginal tracts were lavaged using 60 μl PBS and samples stored at -20\n0\nC on two occasions. [0295] In each group, 4 mice were sacrificed at day 38 for spleen cell proliferation assays. Spleens were removed and spleen cell cultures maintained separately for tissues from each experimental animal.\n\n\n[0296] At day 14 after the last immunization, subsets of mice were sacrificed for immunological evaluation. Spleen cell suspensions were cultured for cell proliferation assays and cytokine assays. For proliferation assays, cells (1.25 x 10\n6\n cells/ml) were cultured in 96- well plates for 5 days in the presence or absence of Chlamydia antigen recombinant HtrA protein or UV-inactivated inclusion bodies at 1, 3, lOμ/ml. Concanavalin A (5μg/ml, Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as a positive control in the assay. Methyl-\n3\nH thymidine (Amersham Biosciences Co., Piscataway, NJ) at 1 μCi/well was added to the cultures during the last 18 to 24 hours of the day culture period. Pulsed cells were harvested and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Cell proliferation was expressed as the stimulation index (SI; CPM of triplicate antigen-restimulated wells/CPM of triplicate background wells for each animal). [0297] For cytokine assays, spleen cells from individual mice were cultured at 2x 10\n6\n cells/ml in the presence or absence of Chlamydia antigen recombinant HtrA protein or UV-inactivated inclusion bodies at 1, 3, lOμg/ml for 4 days. Culture supernatants were harvested and assayed for cytokine IFN-γ and IL-5 were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). [0298] One-way ANOVA test was used to determine the significance of differences between groups using Prism software program version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). [0299] Figure 5 shows spleen cell proliferative response to recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA. Spleens were removed and splenocyte cell cultures maintained separately for tissues from animals immunized with either 10 or 50 μg recombinant HtrA. Cultures were restimulated in vitro with either 1, 3, or 10 μg/ml of HtrA or ConA, as a negative control. Panel A shows stimulation index for each group of cultures restimulated with HtrA. Panel B shows stimulation index for each group of cultures challenged with ConA. * P<0.05 compared with naive mice at same concentration of antigen restimulation.\n\n\n[0300] As shown in Figure 5, spleen cell proliferation in response to restimulation with recombinant HtrA was enhanced relative to naive controls in tissues from animals previously immunized with either 10 or 50 μg HtrA. While the lowest restimulation concentration had no apparent effect, at both 3 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml HtrA, proliferation was enhanced relative to naive controls in tissues from animals immunized with either 10 or 50 μg HtrA. The effect was \n\n statistically significant at the highest restimulation dose of tissues from animals immunized with the highest dose of HtrA (P<0.05,). Spleen cell isolated from animals immunized with either 10 or 50 μg recombinant HtrA did not differ from those of naive animals in response to ConA, which was used as a negative control.\n\n\nExample 4: Humoral immune response to recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA\n\n\n[0301] Mice were immunized as described in Example 3. Serum samples from each experimental animal obtained on day 26 were assayed for anti-HtrA IgG levels. Each well of ELISA plates were incubated overnight at 4°C with 100 μl recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA (2 μg/ml) in 0.1 M NaHCO\n3\n buffer. Plates were washed four times with 0.01% TWEEN-20™ in PBS then incubated with PBS containing 2% BSA for 2 hours at room temperature. Serum samples were diluted in series in PBS containing 2% BSA. Beginning with an initial dilution of 1 :100, samples were diluted ten (10) consecutive times, two to four- fold per dilution, and dispensed into separate wells. Plates were washed four times with 0.01% TWEEN-20 ™ in PBS then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 100 μl horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti -mouse IgGγ at 1 :10,000 dilution in PBS containing 2% BSA. Plates were washed four times with 0.01% TWEEN-20™ in PBS then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with TMB peroxidase substrate A. TMB stop solution was added and the ELISA plate read at OD\n45O\n- Where OD\n450\n values were out of range, repeat dilution series were performed at higher dilutions. ELISA antibody titers of anti-HtrA IgG were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution at the end point of titration, OD\n450\n value of 0.10.\n\n\n[0302] Figure 6 shows serum anti-HtrA IgG titers after immunization with either 10 or 50 μg recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA or PBS. ELISA plate wells were coated with HtrA then incubated with a dilution series of serum samples. IgG binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase conjugated second antibody binding. Antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilution at the end point of titration. * P<.01, ** P<.001 compared with PBS controls. [0303] As shown in Figure 6, serum anti-HtrA IgG was significantly elevated in animals immunized with either 10 or 50 μg recombinant HtrA, relative to PBS controls. This suggests that C. trachomatis HtrA is strongly immunogenic. \n\n Example 5 : Immunoprotective effect of immunization with recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA\n\n\n[0304] Mice were immunized as described in Example 3. At day 28, 6 mice from each group were administered a 2.5 mg subcutaneous injection of depo-provera. At day 35, the same 6 mice from each group were vaginally challenged with 3 x 10\n6\n IFU of C. trachomatis serovar E in 20 μl SPG and, also, administered a second 2.5 mg subcutaneous injection of depo-provera. Vaginal samples were collected using swabs at day 3, 7, 10 and 14-post challenge. EFU were determined for each vaginal swab sample, as described in Example 3.\n\n\n[0305] Figure 7 shows the effect of prior immunization with recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA on the level of genital tract infection after vaginal challenge with serovar E. IFU C. trachomatis in vaginal samples taken at days 3, 7, 10 and 14 after challenge are shown on log scale for animals immunized with 10 or 50 μg recombinant HtrA alone (panel A); with 10 or 50 μg recombinant HtrA and 5 μg mLT (panel B); with PBS or with C. trachomatis serovar E (both panels A and B). * P<0.01; ** P<0.001 compared to PBS controls at the same time point post infection.\n\n\n[0306] As shown in Figure 7, experimental animals immunized nasally with recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA had less bacterial shedding at day 10 and 14 post infection, compared with PBS controls. Mice immunized with both HtrA and mLT (i.e., AB5), an adjuvant candidate, similarly had less bacterial shedding at day 10 and 14 post infection. Mice recovered from previous infection with C. trachomatis serovar E had nearly complete protection against reinfection, as expected.\n\n\n[0307] Figure 8 shows effect of prior immunization with recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA on total vaginal exposure to C. trachomatis during 14 days post-infection of animals subject to vaginal challenge with serovar E. Total vaginal exposure was calculated as the sum across all measurement days of IFU C. trachomatis detected in vaginal samples x days elapsed since last measurement and is shown for PBS controls and for animals immunized with 10 or 50 μg HtrA alone, or with 10 or 50 μg HtrA and 5 μg mLT (i.e., AB5). * PO.01; ** PO.001 compared to PBS.\n\n\n[0308] As shown in Figure 8, when data are expressed as total vaginal exposure, or area under the genital recovery curve (AUC), a slight adjuvant effect is observed. Total exposure (AUC) for each experimental animal was calculated as the sum across all four measurements at days 3, 7, 10 and 14 post-infection of IFU x days elapsed since last measurement. Mice immunized with \n\n either 10 or 50 μg recombinant HtrA either with or without mLT (i.e., AB5) had significantly reduced total exposure to infectious C. trachomatis, compared with PBS controls. Mice immunized with both HtrA and mLT had slightly lower total exposure than mice immunized with HtrA alone.\n\n\n[0309] These results demonstrate that recombinant C. trachomatis HtrA induces protective immunity in vivo.\n\n\nExample 6. Inactivation of Inherent C. trachomatis HtrA Protease Activity.\n\n\n[0310] To extend the utility of the recombinant HtrA protein to prevent and/or treat Chlamydia sp. infection and disease, the protein's inherent protease activity can be ablated or reduced without adversely affecting the immunogenicity or antigenicity of the protein using a variety of standard genetic and molecular biology methodologies. Protease-deficient HtrA forms would be more amenable for combination with other protein antigens and/or other vaccines containing protein antigens (e.g. the Merck HPV vaccine, Guardisil) to produce a stable multivalent Chlamydia vaccines and/or stable multi-agent vaccines.\n\n\n[0311] Protease-deficient HtrA forms can be produced using conventional site-directed mutagenesis techniques to change one or more of the three serine protease catalytic residues in the protein (e.g. Hisl37, Aspl55, Ser247 in SEQ E) NO:2) to non-catalytically active residues (e.g. substituting Ala for His at residue position 137; Hl 37A). Other residues within the HtrA protein may also be changed to reduce or eliminate protease activity. Similarly, one or more of the catalytic triad residues or other residues or various segments within the HtrA protein could be deleted to ablate protease activity and generate a highly stable vaccine component.\n\n\n[0312] Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to examples above, it is understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is limited only by the following claims. All cited patents, patent applications and publications referred to in this application are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety."

Description\n\n\n\n\n Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis Inactivating\n\n\nToxins\n\n\nSTATEMENT AS TO FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH Studies described herein were supported by the U.S. Army Medical Research\n\n\nAcquisition Activity (W81XWH-04-2-0001) and the NIH/NIAID (1U01AI082120- 01). The Government has certain rights in this invention.\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/083,667, filed on July 25, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in its entirely herein.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThis disclosure relates to materials and methods for inhibiting a protein synthesis inactivating toxin. In particular, provided herein are materials and methods for inhibiting ricin, Shiga toxins, Shiga-like toxins (e.g., E. coli 0157:57), and abrin toxins.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nRicin is a potent heterodimeric cytotoxin isolated from the seeds of the castor plant, Ricinus communis, Euphorbiacea. The protein consists of a lectin B chain (RTB), which can bind cell surfaces and is linked by disulfide bonds to an A chain (RTA), which enzymatically depurinates a specific adenine residue in 28S rRNA. Ricin is an extraordinarily toxic molecule that attacks ribosomes, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. As RTA exhibits this type of destructive catalytic activity, RTA is commonly referred to as a type II ribosome inactivating protein (RIP). The toxic consequences of ricin are due to the biological activity of RTA. RTB binds the toxin to cell surface receptors and then RTA is transferred inside the cell where inhibition of ribosome activity occurs. Ricin has an LD50 of approximately 1 μg/kg body weight for mice, rats, and dogs. The toxic dose for humans is likely to be in the μg/kg range which ranks it among the most toxic substances known. \n\n Shiga toxins are a family of related toxins with two major groups, Stxl and Stx2, whose genes are considered to be part of the genome of lambdoid prophages. The most common sources for Shiga toxin are the bacteria S. dysenteriae and the Shigatoxigenic group of Escherichia coli (STEC), which includes serotype O157:H7 and other enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Shiga toxins act to inhibit protein synthesis within target cells by a mechanism similar to that of riciii toxin.\n\n\nΛbrin is a natural poison that is found in the seeds of a plant called the rosary pea or jet} unity pea. Like ricin, abrin can penetrate cclL and inhibit protein synthesis. Both ricin and abrin have potential medical use as components of immunotoxins. Given the above, there is interest in identifying or designing potent inhibitors of ricin, Shiga, Shiga-like, and abrin toxins. These inhibitors could, in principle, be used as co-treatment to limit or control immunotoxin toxicity, or could be used as an antidote or prophylaxis to poison attacks or food poisonings.\n\n\nSUMMARY This disclosure provides materials and methods for inhibiting a protein synthesis inactivating toxin. For example, small-molecule inhibitors of ricin, abrin, Shiga toxins, and Shiga-like toxins are provided.

For example, small-molecule inhibitors of ricin, abrin, Shiga toxins, and Shiga-like toxins are provided. Methods for using such small- molecule inhibitors to treat, prevent, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of protein synthesis inactivating toxin poisoning are also provided. Kits and articles of manufacture containing one or more small-molecule inhibitors and accessory items are also provided. Further provided is a method of identifying inhibitors of protein synthesis inactivating toxins.\n\n\nA. Definitions As used herein, \"protein synthesis inactivating toxin\" includes toxins that are ribonucleases, N-glycosidases, or ADP-ribosyltransferases. N-glycosidases are exemplified by the single polypeptide of the plant type I ribosome inactivating \n\n proteins (RIP) (e.g., gelonin, momordin, and saporin), the \"A\" chain of the plant type II ribosome -inactivating proteins (e.g., ricin, abrin, and modeccin), and similar acting bacterial toxins (e.g., Shiga toxins). The term \"protein synthesis inactivating toxin\" as used herein also includes specific ribonucleases that digest a specific phosphodiester bond in the backbone of ribosomal RNA, thereby inactivating the ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis. Ribonucleases are exemplified by the fungal toxins alpha-sarcin, mitogillin, and restrictocin, and also include similar acting bacterial toxins. The term \"protein synthesis inactivating toxin\" also includes the ADP- ribosylating component of the ADP-ribosyltransferases, which are proteolytically activated bacterial toxins that ADP-ribosylate, and thus inactivate, components of the protein synthesis machinery (e.g., diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A).\n\n\nPlant ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are N-glycosidases that cleave (i.e. depurinate) the N-glycosidic bond of adenine in a specific ribosomal RNA sequence. Many RIPs are single-chain proteins (type I RIPs), but some (type II RIPs) possess a galactose-specific lectin domain that binds to cell surfaces. The type II RIPs are potent toxins, and include, for example, ricin.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"type II ribosome-inactivating proteins\" or \"type II RIPs\" means two-chain N-glycosidases that cleave the N-glycosidic bond of adenine in a specific ribosomal RNA sequence, wherein the two chains are an A chain, which possesses the N-glycosidase activity, and a B chain, which comprises a galactose- specific lectin domain that binds to cell surfaces. Ricin is one example of a prototypical type II ribosome-inactivating protein, but other such type II RIPs include abrin (from Abrus precatrius), modeccin (from Adenia digtata), viscumin (from Viscum album), Shiga toxin (from S. dysenteriae), and volkensin (from Adenia volkensii).\n\n\nAs used herein, \"ricin A chain\" of \"RTA\" means an N-glycosidase of about 32 KDa that digests and inactivates 26S and 28S ribosomal RNA by cleavage of a specific adenine residue located within a highly conserved region of the 26S and 28S ribosomal RNA. As used herein, \"ricin B chain\" or \"RTB\" means a galactose/N- acetylgalactosamine-binding lectin of about 34 KDa.\n\n\nAs used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of a compound include salts, esters, enol ethers, enol esters, acetals, ketals, orthoesters, hemiacetals, \n\n hemiketals, acids, bases, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs thereof.

The compounds are, in one embodiment, formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as solutions, suspensions, tablets, dispersible tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations or elixirs, for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration, as well as transdermal patch preparation and dry powder inhalers. In one embodiment, the compounds described above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the art (see, e.g., Ansel Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Fourth Edition 1985, 126).\n\n\nIn the compositions, effective concentrations of one or more compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof is (are) mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. The compounds may be derivatized as the corresponding salts, esters, enol ethers or esters, acetals, ketals, orthoesters, hemiacetals, hemiketals, acids, bases, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs prior to formulation, as described above. The concentrations of the compounds in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that treats or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of N-glycosidase or type II ribosome inhibiting protein poisoning (e.g., ricin, abrin, a Shiga toxin, or a Shiga-like toxin poisoning).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of compound is \n\n dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected carrier at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or one or more symptoms are ameliorated.\n\n\nThe active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the compounds in in vitro and in vivo systems, and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans.\n\n\nThe concentration of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, the physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nPharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide from about 0.01 mg, 0.1 mg or 1 mg to about 200 mg, 1000 mg or 2000 mg, and in one embodiment from about 10 mg to about 200 mg of the active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form.\n\n\nThe active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disorder being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions.\n\n\nIn instances in which the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing compounds may be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art, and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants, such as TWEEN®, or dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the compounds, such as prodrugs of the compounds may also be used in formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions. \n\n Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition treated and may be empirically determined.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions, and oil- water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. The pharmaceutically therapeutically active compounds and derivatives thereof are, in one embodiment, formulated and administered in unit-dosage forms or multiple-dosage forms. Unit-dose forms as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampoules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. Unit-dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses which are not segregated in packaging. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, or otherwise mixing an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine derivatives, sorbitan \n\n monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and other such agents.\n\n\nActual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical 5 Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975.\n\n\nDosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.005% to 100% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared. Methods for preparation of these compositions are known to those skilled in the art. The contemplated compositions may contain 0.001%- 100% active ingredient, or in o one embodiment 0.1-95%.\n\n\n1. Compositions for oral administration\n\n\nOral pharmaceutical dosage forms are either solid, gel or liquid. The solid dosage forms are tablets, capsules, granules, and bulk powders. Types of oral tablets include compressed, chewable lozenges and tablets which may be enteric-coated,5 sugar-coated or film-coated. Capsules may be hard or soft gelatin capsules, while granules and powders may be provided in non-effervescent or effervescent form with the combination of other ingredients known to those skilled in the art. a. Solid compositions for oral administration In certain embodiments, the formulations are solid dosage forms, in one0 embodiment, capsules or tablets.

For example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such ingredient.\n\n\nWhen the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The compounds can also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, sprinkle, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action. The active ingredient is a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof as described herein. Higher concentrations, up to about 98% by weight of the active ingredient, may be included. In all embodiments, tablets and capsules formulations may be coated as known by those of skill in the art in order to modify or sustain dissolution of the active ingredient. Thus, for example, they may be coated with a conventional enterically digestible coating, such as phenylsalicylate, waxes and cellulose acetate phthalate. \n\n b.

Such solutions, and the preparation and encapsulation thereof, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,328,245; 4,409,239; and 4,410,545. For a liquid dosage form, the solution, e.g., for example, in a polyethylene glycol, may be diluted with a sufficient quantity of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, e.g. , water, to be easily measured for administration.\n\n\nAlternatively, liquid or semi-solid oral formulations may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the active compound or salt in vegetable oils, glycols, triglycerides, propylene glycol esters (e.g., propylene carbonate) and other such carriers, and encapsulating these solutions or suspensions in hard or soft gelatin capsule shells. Other useful formulations include those set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. RE28,819 and 4,358,603. Briefly, such formulations include, but are not limited to, those containing a compound provided herein, a dialkylated mono- or poly-alkylene glycol, including, but not limited to, 1 ,2-dimethoxymethane, diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, polyethylene glycol-320-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-520- dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-720-dimethyl ether wherein 320, 520 and 720 refer to the approximate average molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol, and one or more antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, vitamin E, hydroquinone, hydroxycoumarins, ethanolamine, lecithin, cephalin, ascorbic acid, malic acid, sorbitol, phosphoric acid, thiodipropionic acid and its esters, and dithiocarbamates.\n\n\nOther formulations include, but are not limited to, aqueous alcoholic solutions including a pharmaceutically acceptable acetal.

Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, \n\n or as emulsions. The injectables, solutions and emulsions also contain one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizers, solubility enhancers, and other such agents, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate and cyclodextrins.\n\n\nImplantation of a slow-release or sustained-release system, such that a constant level of dosage is maintained (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,710,795) is also contemplated herein. Briefly, a compound provided herein is dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The compound diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active compound contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject. Parenteral administration of the compositions includes intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations. Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile solutions ready for injection, sterile dry soluble products, such as lyophilized powders, ready to be combined with a solvent just prior \n\n to use, including hypodermic tablets, sterile suspensions ready for injection, sterile dry insoluble products ready to be combined with a vehicle just prior to use and sterile emulsions. The solutions may be either aqueous or nonaqueous.\n\n\nIf administered intravenously, suitable carriers include physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and solutions containing thickening and solubilizing agents, such as glucose, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in parenteral preparations include aqueous vehicles, nonaqueous vehicles, antimicrobial agents, isotonic agents, buffers, antioxidants, local anesthetics, suspending and dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, sequestering or chelating agents and other pharmaceutically acceptable substances. Examples of aqueous vehicles include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringers Injection, Isotonic Dextrose Injection, Sterile Water Injection, Dextrose and Lactated Ringers Injection. Nonaqueous parenteral vehicles include fixed oils of vegetable origin, cottonseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil and peanut oil. Antimicrobial agents in bacteriostatic or fungistatic concentrations must be added to parenteral preparations packaged in multiple-dose containers which include phenols or cresols, mercurials, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, methyl and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride. Isotonic agents include sodium chloride and dextrose. Buffers include phosphate and citrate. Antioxidants include sodium bisulfate. Local anesthetics include procaine hydrochloride. Suspending and dispersing agents include sodium carboxymethylcelluose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Emulsifying agents include Polysorbate 80 (TWEEN® 80). A sequestering or chelating agent of metal ions include EDTA. Pharmaceutical carriers also include ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol for water miscible vehicles; and sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, citric acid or lactic acid for pH adjustment. The concentration of the pharmaceutically active compound is adjusted so that an injection provides an effective amount to produce the desired pharmacological effect. The exact dose depends on the age, weight and condition of the patient or animal as is known in the art. \n\n The unit-dose parenteral preparations are packaged in an ampoule, a vial or a syringe with a needle. All preparations for parenteral administration should be sterile, as is known and practiced in the art.\n\n\nIllustratively, intravenous or intraarterial infusion of a sterile aqueous solution containing an active compound is an effective mode of administration. Another embodiment is a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension containing an active material injected as necessary to produce the desired pharmacological effect.\n\n\nInjectables are designed for local and systemic administration. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective dosage is formulated to contain a concentration of at least about 0.1% w/w up to about 90% w/w or more, in certain embodiments more than 1% w/w of the active compound to the treated tissue(s).\n\n\nThe compound may be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or may be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product or to produce a prodrug. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the condition and may be empirically determined.\n\n\n3. Lyophilized powders\n\n\nOf interest herein are also lyophilized powders, which can be reconstituted for administration as solutions, emulsions and other mixtures. They may also be reconstituted and formulated as solids or gels.\n\n\nThe sterile, lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in a suitable solvent. The solvent may contain an excipient which improves the stability or other pharmacological component of the powder or reconstituted solution, prepared from the powder. Excipients that may be used include, but are not limited to, dextrose, sorbital, fructose, corn syrup, xylitol, glycerin, glucose, sucrose or other suitable agent. The solvent may also contain a buffer, such as citrate, sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at, in one embodiment, about neutral pH. Subsequent sterile filtration of the solution followed by lyophilization under standard conditions known to those of skill in the art provides the desired formulation. In one embodiment, the resulting solution will be apportioned into vials for lyophilization. Each vial will contain a single dosage or \n\n multiple dosages of the compound. The lyophilized powder can be stored under appropriate conditions, such as at about 4 \n0\nC to room temperature.\n\n\nReconstitution of this lyophilized powder with water for injection provides a formulation for use in parenteral administration. For reconstitution, the lyophilized powder is added to sterile water or other suitable carrier. The precise amount depends upon the selected compound. Such amount can be empirically determined. 4. Topical administration\n\n\nTopical mixtures are prepared as described for the local and systemic administration. The resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsions or the like and are formulated as creams, gels, ointments, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, lotions, suspensions, tinctures, pastes, foams, aerosols, irrigations, sprays, suppositories, bandages, dermal patches or any other formulations suitable for topical administration.\n\n\nThe compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof may be formulated as aerosols for topical application, such as by inhalation (see, e.g., U.S.\n\n\nPatent Nos. 4,044,126, 4,414,209, and 4,364,923, which describe aerosols for delivery of a steroid useful for treatment of inflammatory diseases, particularly asthma). These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfme powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation will, in one embodiment, have diameters of less than 20 microns, in one embodiment less than 10 microns.\n\n\nThe compounds may be formulated for local or topical application, such as for topical application to the skin and mucous membranes, such as in the eye, in the form of gels, creams, and lotions and for application to the eye or for intracisternal or intraspinal application. Topical administration is contemplated for transdermal delivery and also for administration to the eyes or mucosa, or for inhalation therapies. Nasal solutions of the active compound alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can also be administered. These solutions, particularly those intended for ophthalmic use, may be formulated as 0.01% - 10% isotonic solutions, pH about 5-7, with appropriate salts. \n\n 5. Compositions for other routes of administration\n\n\nOther routes of administration, such as transdermal patches, including iontophoretic and electrophoretic devices, and rectal administration, are also contemplated herein. Transdermal patches, including iotophoretic and electrophoretic devices, are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, such patches are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,267,983, 6,261,595, 6,256,533, 6,167,301, 6,024,975, 6,010715, 5,985,317, 5,983,134, 5,948,433, and 5,860,957.\n\n\nFor example, pharmaceutical dosage forms for rectal administration are rectal suppositories, capsules and tablets for systemic effect. Rectal suppositories are used herein mean solid bodies for insertion into the rectum which melt or soften at body temperature releasing one or more pharmacologically or therapeutically active ingredients. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances utilized in rectal suppositories are bases or vehicles and agents to raise the melting point. Examples of bases include cocoa butter (theobroma oil), glycerin-gelatin, carbowax (polyoxyethylene glycol) and appropriate mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Combinations of the various bases may be used. Agents to raise the melting point of suppositories include spermaceti and wax. Rectal suppositories may be prepared either by the compressed method or by molding. The weight of a rectal suppository, in one embodiment, is about 2 to 3 gm.\n\n\nTablets and capsules for rectal administration are manufactured using the same pharmaceutically acceptable substance and by the same methods as for formulations for oral administration.\n\n\n6. Articles of manufacture The compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be packaged as articles of manufacture (e.g., kits) containing packaging material, a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof provided herein within the packaging material, and a label that indicates that the compound or composition, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, is useful for treatment, prevention, or amelioration of one or more symptoms or disorders in which a protein synthesis inactivating toxin poisoning, including ricin, abrin, a Shiga toxin, or a Shiga-like toxin poisoning, is implicated. \n\n The articles of manufacture provided herein contain packaging materials. Packaging materials for use in packaging pharmaceutical products are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,323,907, 5,052,558 and 5,033,252. Examples of pharmaceutical packaging materials include, but are not limited to, blister packs, bottles, tubes, inhalers, pumps, bags, vials, containers, syringes, bottles, and any packaging material suitable for a selected formulation and intended mode of administration and treatment. 7. Sustained Release Formulations Also provided are sustained release formulations to deliver the compounds to the desired target at high circulating levels (between 10\n\"9\n and 10\n\"4\n M). The levels are either circulating in the patient systemically, or in one embodiment, localized to a site of, e.g., paralysis.\n\n\nIt is understood that the compound levels are maintained over a certain period of time as is desired and can be easily determined by one skilled in the art. Such sustained and/or timed release formulations may be made by sustained release means of delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in US Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3, 598,123; 4,008,719; 4,710,384; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556 and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are each incorporated herein by reference. These pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or sustained release of one or more of the active compounds using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or the like. Suitable sustained release formulations known to those skilled in the art, including those described herein, may be readily selected for use with the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. Thus, single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration, such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, powders and the like, that are adapted for sustained release are contemplated herein. In one embodiment, the sustained release formulation contains active compound such as, but not limited to, microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, ethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate. As described above, all known methods for encapsulation which are compatible with properties of the disclosed compounds are contemplated herein. The sustained release formulation is encapsulated by coating \n\n particles or granules of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein with varying thickness of slowly soluble polymers or by microencapsulation. In one embodiment, the sustained release formulation is encapsulated with a coating material of varying thickness (e.g. about 1 micron to 200 microns) that allow the dissolution of the pharmaceutical composition about 48 hours to about 72 hours after administration to a mammal. In another embodiment, the coating material is a food-approved additive.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the sustained release formulation is a matrix dissolution device that is prepared by compressing the drug with a slowly soluble polymer carrier into a tablet. In one embodiment, the coated particles have a size range between about 0.1 to about 300 microns, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,710,384 and 5,354,556, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Each of the particles is in the form of a micromatrix, with the active ingredient uniformly distributed throughout the polymer.\n\n\nSustained release formulations such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,710,384, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, having a relatively high percentage of plasticizer in the coating in order to permit sufficient flexibility to prevent substantial breakage during compression are disclosed. The specific amount of plasticizer varies depending on the nature of the coating and the particular plasticizer used. The amount may be readily determined empirically by testing the release characteristics of the tablets formed. If the medicament is released too quickly, then more plasticizer is used. Release characteristics are also a function of the thickness of the coating. When substantial amounts of plasticizer are used, the sustained release capacity of the coating diminishes. Thus, the thickness of the coating may be increased slightly to make up for an increase in the amount of plasticizer. Generally, the plasticizer in such an embodiment will be present in an amount of about 15 to 30 % of the sustained release material in the coating, in one embodiment 20 to 25 %, and the amount of coating will be from 10 to 25% of the weight of the active material, and in another embodiment, 15 to 20 % of the weight of active material. Any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizer may be incorporated into the coating.\n\n\nThe compounds provided herein can be formulated as a sustained and/or timed release formulation. All sustained release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-sustained \n\n counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed sustained release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition. Advantages of sustained release formulations may include: 1) extended activity of the composition, 2) reduced dosage frequency, and 3) increased patient compliance. In addition, sustained release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the composition, and thus can affect the occurrence of side effects.\n\n\nThe sustained release formulations provided herein are designed to initially release an amount of the therapeutic composition that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of compositions to maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level in the body, the therapeutic composition must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the composition being metabolized and excreted from the body.\n\n\nThe sustained release of an active ingredient may be stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\nPreparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound. In one embodiment, the compounds are formulated as controlled release powders of discrete microparticles that can be readily formulated in liquid form. The sustained release powder comprises particles containing an active ingredient and optionally, an excipient with at least one non-toxic polymer. The powder can be dispersed or suspended in a liquid vehicle and will maintain its sustained release characteristics for a useful period of time. These dispersions or suspensions have both chemical stability and stability in terms of dissolution rate. The powder may contain an excipient comprising a polymer, which may be soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable, or biodegradable. The polymers may be polymers or copolymers. The polymer may be a natural or synthetic polymer. Natural polymers include polypeptides (e.g., zein), polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose), and alginic acid. Representative synthetic polymers include those described, but not limited to, those described in column 3, lines 33-45 of U.S. Patent No. 5,354,556, \n\n which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Particularly suitable polymers include those described, but not limited to those described in column 3, line 46- column 4, line 8 of U.S. Patent No. 5,354,556 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The sustained release compositions provided herein may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by intramuscular injections or implants for subcutaneous tissues and various body cavities and transdermal devices. In one embodiment, intramuscular injections are formulated as aqueous or oil suspensions. In an aqueous suspension, the sustained release effect is due to, in part, a reduction in solubility of the active compound upon complexation or a decrease in dissolution rate. A similar approach is taken with oil suspensions and solutions, wherein the release rate of an active compound is determined by partitioning of the active compound out of the oil into the surrounding aqueous medium. Only active compounds which are oil soluble and have the desired partition characteristics are suitable. Oils that may be used for intramuscular injection include, but are not limited to, sesame, olive, arachis, maize, almond, soybean, cottonseed and castor oil.\n\n\nA highly developed form of drug delivery that imparts sustained release over periods of time ranging from days to years is to implant a drug-bearing polymeric device subcutaneously or in various body cavities. The polymer material used in an implant, which must be biocompatible and nontoxic, include but are not limited to hydrogels, silicones, polyethylenes, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, or biodegradable polymers.\n\n\nE. Evaluation of the activity of the compounds\n\n\nThe activity of the compounds provided herein as inhibitors of a protein synthesis inactivating toxin (e.g., ricin, abrin, a Shiga toxin, or a Shiga-like toxin) may be measured in a luminometer assay, e.g., those described in Iizuka, N. and Sarnow, P., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 11(4):353-360 (1997). In one example, a test compound can be incubated with ricin A chain (RTA) and the mixture added to an assay mixture containing a yeast cell-free translation competent extract and capped lucierase RNA. The assay can be stopped by the addition of 100 μL TBS buffer. The amount of active luciferase protein (indicating translation efficiency of the in vitro reaction) can be measured using a luminometer following addition of a luciferase assay reagent. As a negative control, cycloheximide \n\n can be used as a translation inhibitor in the in vitro assay instead of ricin, to identify small molecules that may affect other steps in translation (e.g., other than ribosome depurination).\n\n\nThe activity of the compounds provided herein as inhibitors of a protein synthesis inactivating toxin (e.g., ricin, abrin, a Shiga toxin, or a Shiga-like toxin) may also be measured using a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation assay. In some embodiments, an RRL assay can be performed using 2:1 RRL obtained from Green Hectares (Oregon, Wis.). The RRL can be supplemented with the same ATP regeneration system used for the yeast in vitro translation assays discussed above, and the assay performed identically except the reaction is incubated at 3O\n0\nC for 1 hour.\n\n\nInhibitors of protein synthesis inactivating toxins can be evaluated using three different types of assays: (a) a neutralization assay (cells+inhibitor(s)+toxin mixed together at the same time); (b) a pre-treat assay (cells+inhibitor(s) preincubated before toxin challenge); and (c) a rescue assay (cells+toxin preincubated for some time before adding inhibitor(s)). In some embodiments, the antagonist(s) can be incubated with Ie4 Sp2/0-Agl4 (Sp2) mouse myeloma cells in hybridoma serum- free medium for 3 hrs at 37° C in 96-well microplates. The toxin can be added to the cells to yield 40 pg/mL final concentration and the mixtures further incubated overnight. Metabolic activity of the cells can be determined using a CellTiter 96 Aqueous Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). In some embodiments, the results are expressed in percent of the metabolic activity of Sp2 or Vera cells incubated under the same conditions in the absence of toxin and antagonist(s).\n\n\nF. Methods of use of the compounds and compositions\n\n\nProvided herein are methods to treat, prevent, or ameliorate symptoms or disorders associated with a protein synthesis inactivating toxin poisoning, including ricin, abrin, a Shiga toxin, or a Shiga-like toxin poisoning. The methods include administering one or more of the compounds described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form or derivative thereof, to a mammal, e.g., a human, cat, dog, horse, pig, cow, sheep, mouse, rat, or monkey. In certain embodiments, the symptoms or disorders associated with a protein synthesis inactivating toxin may depend on the route of exposure. In some embodiments, exposure to a protein synthesis inactivating toxin may occur via inhalation, ingestion, or injection. In some embodiments, the symptoms or disorders \n\n associated with a protein synthesis inactivating toxin poisoning may depend on the dose received.

Such amounts are sufficient to achieve a therapeutically effective concentration of the compound or active component of the composition in vivo.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein can also be used in combination with one or more one or more type II ribosome inactivating protein vaccines. In some embodiments, such combinations can be used to inhibit type II ribosome inactivating protein poisoning; reduce incapacitating local tissue damage at a portal of a type II ribosome inactivating protein entry; and/or reduce incapacitating lung damage in a subject.\n\n\nG Methods of Designing Inhibitors Targeting the Ricin Active Site Provided herein are methods, including computer-based methods, for designing compounds that bind to and/or inhibit an active site of ricin as set forth in the crystal structure having PDB code HFS. The active site of ricin includes, but is not limited to, the residues of region I and/or II in the active site of the crystal structure HFS. Region I includes residues AsplOO, He- 104, Asp75, Asn78, Tyr80, Val82, Phe93, Glyl20, Glyl21, Asnl22, His94, Pro95, and Asp96 having the conformations as set forth in the HFS crystal structure. Region II includes residues Tyr80, Val81, Phe93, Glyl21, Asnl22, Tyrl23, Ilel72, Argl80, Ala79, Serl76, Glul77, and Leul26 having the conformations as set forth in the HFS crystal structure. Inhibitors bound in Region I (see Region-I inhibitors of Example 8) can be tethered to inhibitors anchored in Region II (see Region-II inhibitors of Example 8) to form more potent and selective heterodimeric inhibitors (see Example 8)\n\n\nThe inventors have determined that the conformations of residues in region I and/or region II, as found in crystal structure HF S, are useful for determining \n\n inhibitors with high affinity for the active site. Thus, given the three-dimensional model described herein as well as the identification of region I and II in the proper configuration as useful residues to target, one having ordinary skill in the art would know how to use standard molecular modeling or other techniques to identify peptides, peptidomimetics, and small-molecules that would bind to or interact with one or more of the residues in region I and/or II. In addition, one having ordinary skill in the art would be able to combine targeting such residues with the targeting of other amino acids (e.g., Arg213) that are located at the rim of the ricin active site.\n\n\nBy \"molecular modeling\" is meant quantitative and/or qualitative analysis of the structure and function of physical interactions based on three-dimensional structural information and interaction models. This includes conventional numeric- based molecular dynamic and energy minimization models, interactive computer graphic models, modified molecular mechanics models, distance geometry and other structure-based constraint models. Molecular modeling typically is performed using a computer and may be further optimized using known methods. See Example 1 below.\n\n\nMethods of designing compounds that bind specifically (e.g., with high affinity) to one or more of the residues described previously typically are also computer-based, and involve the use of a computer having a program capable of generating an atomic model. Computer programs that use X-ray crystallography data or molecular model coordinate data, such as the data that are available from the PDB, are particularly useful for designing such compounds. Programs such as RasMol, for example, can be used to generate a three dimensional model. Computer programs such as INSIGHT (Accelrys, Burlington, MA), Auto-Dock (Accelrys), and Discovery Studio 1.5 (Accelrys) allow for further manipulation and the ability to introduce new structures.\n\n\nCompounds can be designed using, for example, computer hardware or software, or a combination of both. However, designing is preferably implemented in one or more computer programs executing on one or more programmable computers, each containing a processor and at least one input device. The computer(s) preferably also contain(s) a data storage system (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements) and at least one output device. Program code is applied to input data to perform the functions described above and generate output information. The output information is applied to one or more output devices in a known fashion. \n\n The computer can be, for example, a personal computer, microcomputer, or work station of conventional design.\n\n\nEach program is preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the programs can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language can be a compiled or interpreted language.\n\n\nEach computer program is preferably stored on a storage media or device\n\n\n(e.g., ROM or magnetic diskette) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer. The computer program serves to configure and operate the computer to perform the procedures described herein when the program is read by the computer. The method of the invention can also be implemented by means of a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein. For example, a computer-assisted method of generating a test inhibitor of the active site of ricin as set forth by the crystal structure HFS is provided. The method uses a programmed computer comprising a processor and an input device, and can include:\n\n\n(a) inputting on the input device, e.g., through a keyboard, a diskette, or a tape, data (e.g. atomic coordinates) comprising a docking box surrounded by one or more one residues of the active site of ricin as defined by the 1IFS crystal structure;\n\n\n(b) docking into the docking box a test inhibitor molecule using the processor; and\n\n\n(c) determining, based on the docking, whether the test inhibitor molecule would be capable of interacting with the one or more residues of the active site.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the method uses a programmed computer comprising a processor, and can include:\n\n\n(a) receiving data (e.g. atomic coordinates) comprising a docking box surrounded by one or more one residues of the active site of ricin as defined by the 1IFS crystal structure at a computing device;\n\n\n(b) docking into the docking box a test inhibitor molecule using the processor; and \n\n (c) determining in the computing device, based on the docking, whether the test inhibitor molecule would be capable of interacting with the one or more residues of the active site.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the method can further include storing in a computer memory storage location the results of docking a test inhibitor molecule into the docking box (e.g., interaction energy values and binding strengths).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the docking box is surrounded by one or more of the residues AsplOO, Ile-104, Asp75, Asn78, Tyr80, Val82, Phe93, Glyl20, Glyl21, Asnl22, His94, Pro95, and Asp96 having conformations as set forth in the HFS crystal structure. In some embodiments, the docking box is surrounded by one or more of residues Tyr80, Val81, Phe93, Glyl21, Asnl22, Tyrl23, Ilel72, Argl80, Ala79, Serl76, Glul77, and Leul26 having confirmations as set forth in the HFS crystal structure. In some embodiments, the test inhibitor molecule is capable of interacting with one or more of residues AsplOO, Ile-104, Asp75, Asn78, Tyr80, Val82, Phe93, Glyl20, Glyl21, Asnl22, His94, Pro95, and Asp96 having conformations as set forth in the HFS crystal structure. In some embodiments, the test inhibitor molecule is capable of interacting with one or more of residues Tyr80, Val81, Phe93, Glyl21, Asnl22, Tyrl23, Ilel72, Argl80, Ala79, Serl76, Glul77, and Leul26 having confirmations as set forth in the HFS crystal structure. By \"capable of interacting\" it is meant capable of forming a one or more hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, pi-pi interactions, cation-pi interactions, sulfur-aromatic interactions, or VdW interactions. In some embodiments, the test inhibitor molecule can interact with one or more residues (e.g., one or more residues of region I or II) of the active site of ricin with a minimum interaction energy of -5 to about -50 kcal/mol, e.g., -20 to -40 kcal/mol. In some embodiments, the test inhibitor would be capable of forming a hydrogen bond with one or more residues of the active site of ricin.\n\n\nThe inhibitory activity of the test inhibitor on ricin in vitro can be evaluated. In some embodiments, the inhibitory activity is evaluated using one or more of a luminometer assay; an RRL assay; a neutralization assay; a pre-treat assay; and a rescue assay (see Examples 2-4).\n\n\nFrom the information obtained using these methods, one skilled in the art will be able to design and make inhibitory compounds {e.g., peptides, non-peptide small \n\n molecules, peptidomimetics, and aptamers (e.g., nucleic acid aptamers)) with the appropriate 3-D structure, e.g., at certain residues and that interact in certain manners (e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ion bonding, covalent bonding, pi-pi interactions, sulfur- aromatic interactions, steric interactions, and/or van der Waals interactions). For example, one of skill in the art could design inhibitory compounds that could interact with one or more of the residues corresponding to AsplOO, Ile-104, Asp75, Asn78, Tyr80, Val82, Phe93, Glyl20, Glyl21, Asnl22, His94, Pro95, and Asp96, or residues Tyr80, Val81, Phe93, Glyl21, Asnl22, Tyrl23, Ilel72, Argl80, Ala79, Serl76, Glul77, and Leul26 whose confirmations are as defined in the HFS crystal structure. Moreover, if computer-usable 3-D data (e.g., x-ray crystallographic data) for a candidate compound are available, one or more of the following computer-based steps can be performed in conjunction with computer-based steps described above:\n\n\n(d) inputting into an input device, e.g., through a keyboard, a diskette, or a tape, data (e.g. atomic coordinates) that define the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of a candidate compound;\n\n\n(e) determining, using a processor, the 3-D structure (e.g., an atomic model) of the candidate compound;\n\n\n(f) determining, using the processor, whether the candidate compound binds to or interacts with one or more of the residues of interest in the ricin active site; (g) determining the interaction energy of the candidate compound;\n\n\n(h) identifying the candidate compound as a compound that inhibits the site; (j) receiving, through an input device, e.g., through a keyboard, a diskette, or a tape, data (e.g. atomic coordinates) that define the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of a candidate compound at a computing device; (k) determining, using the computing device, the 3-D structure (e.g., an atomic model) of the candidate compound;\n\n\n(1) determining, using the computing device, whether the candidate compound binds to or interacts with one or more of the residues of interest in the ricin active site;\n\n\n(m) determining, using the computing device, the interaction energy of the candidate compound; and\n\n\n(n) identifying, using the computing device, the candidate compound as a compound that inhibits the site. \n\n The method can involve an additional step of outputting to an output device a model of the 3-D structure of the compound. The method can also involve an additional step of storing in a computer memory storage location the results of any step of the method. In addition, the 3-D data of candidate compounds can be compared to a computer database of, for example, 3-D structures stored in a data storage system. In some embodiments, the interaction energy of the candidate compound is less than -54 kcal/mol.\n\n\nCandidate compounds identified as described above can then be tested in standard cellular inhibition assays familiar to those skilled in the art. The 3-D structure of molecules can be determined from data obtained by a variety of methodologies. These methodologies include: (a) x-ray crystallography; (b) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy; (c) molecular modeling methods, e.g., homology modeling techniques, threading algorithms, and in particular the refined homology modeling methods described below in Example 1. Any available method can be used to construct a 3-D model of the ricin active site from the x-ray crystallographic, molecular modeling, and/or NMR data using a computer as described above. Such a model can be constructed from analytical data points inputted into the computer by an input device and by means of a processor using known software packages, e.g., CATALYST (Accelrys), INSIGHT (Accelrys) and CeriusII, HKL, MOSFILM, XDS, CCP4, SHARP, PHASES, HEAVY, XPLOR, TNT, NMRCOMPASS, NMRPIPE, DIANA, NMRDRAW, FELIX, VNMR, MADIGRAS, QUANTA, BUSTER, SOLVE, O, FRODO, or CHAIN. The model constructed from these data can be visualized via an output device of a computer, using available systems, e.g., Silicon Graphics, Evans and Sutherland, SUN, Hewlett Packard, Apple Macintosh, DEC, IBM, or Compaq.\n\n\nFIG. 28 is a schematic diagram of a computer system 100. The system 100 can be used for the operations described in association with any of the computer- implement methods described previously, according to one embodiment. The system 100 is intended to include various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. The system 100 can also include mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. Additionally the system can include portable storage media, such \n\n as, Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drives. For example, the USB flash drives may store operating systems and other applications. The USB flash drives can include input/output components, such as a wireless transmitter or USB connector that may be inserted into a USB port of another computing device. The system 100 includes a processor 110, a memory 120, a storage device\n\n\n130, and an input/output device 140. Each of the components 110, 120, 130, and 140 are interconnected using a system bus 150. The processor 110 is capable of processing instructions for execution within the system 100. The processor may be designed using any of a number of architectures. For example, the processor 110 may be a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computers) processor, a RISC (Reduced\n\n\nInstruction Set Computer) processor, or a MISC (Minimal Instruction Set Computer) processor.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the processor 110 is a single-threaded processor. In another embodiment, the processor 110 is a multi-threaded processor. The processor 110 is capable of processing instructions stored in the memory 120 or on the storage device 130 to display graphical information for a user interface on the input/output device 140.\n\n\nThe memory 120 stores information within the system 100. In one embodiment, the memory 120 is a computer-readable medium. In one embodiment, the memory 120 is a volatile memory unit. In another embodiment, the memory 120 is a non- volatile memory unit.\n\n\nThe storage device 130 is capable of providing mass storage for the system 100. In one embodiment, the storage device 130 is a computer-readable medium. In various different embodiments, the storage device 130 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device.\n\n\nThe input/output device 140 provides input/output operations for the system 100. In one embodiment, the input/output device 140 includes a keyboard and/or pointing device. In another embodiment, the input/output device 140 includes a display unit for displaying graphical user interfaces. The features described can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. The apparatus can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage device for execution by a \n\n programmable processor; and method steps can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the described embodiments by operating on input data and generating output. The described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used, directly or indirectly, in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.\n\n\nSuitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and the sole processor or one of multiple processors of any kind of computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to communicate with, one or more mass storage devices for storing data files; such devices include magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto -optical disks; and optical disks. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non- volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, ASICs (application- specific integrated circuits). To provide for interaction with a user, the features can be implemented on a computer having a display device such as a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a \n\n pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer.\n\n\nThe features can be implemented in a computer system that includes a back- end component, such as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, such as an application server or an Internet server, or that includes a front-end component, such as a client computer having a graphical user interface or an Internet browser, or any combination of them. The components of the system can be connected by any form or medium of digital data communication such as a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\"LAN\"), a wide area network (\"WAN\"), peer-to-peer networks (having ad-hoc or static members), grid computing infrastructures, and the Internet.\n\n\nThe computer system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network, such as the described one. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.\n\n\nOnce the 3-D structure of a compound that binds to or interacts with one or more residues of region I or II of the HFS structure has been established using any of the above methods, a compound that has substantially the same 3-D structure (or contains a domain that has substantially the same structure) as the identified compound can be made. In this context, \"has substantially the same 3-D structure\" means that the compound possesses a hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic character that is similar to the identified compound. In some cases, a compound having substantially the same 3-D structure as the identified compound can include a hydroxyl or alkyl moiety.\n\n\nWith the above described 3-D structural data in hand and knowing the chemical structure (e.g., amino acid sequence in the case of a protein) of the region of interest, those of skill in the art would know how to make compounds with the above- described properties. Moreover, one having ordinary skill in the art would know how to derivatize such compounds. Such methods include chemical synthetic methods and, in the case of proteins, recombinant methods.\n\n\nWhile not essential, computer-based methods can be used to design the compounds of the invention. Appropriate computer programs include: InsightII \n\n (Accelrys), CATALYST (Accelrys), LUDI (Accelrys., San Diego, CA), Aladdin (Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Irvine, CA); and LEGEND [Nishibata et al. (1985) J. Med. Chem. 36(20):2921-2928], as well as the methods described in the Examples below and the references cited therein. The above methods can be used to identify small-molecule inhibitors of other type-II ribosome inhibiting proteins. In such embodiments, equivalent residues of the active site as described above could be utilized.\n\n\nEXAMPLES Example 1: Identification of small-molecule inhibitors ofricin using virtual screening and visual inspection\n\n\nTwo-stage docking of 236,925 small molecules into the active site of RTA was carried out by the EUDOC program performed on a dedicated cluster of 800 Intel Xeon P4 processors (2.2/2.4Ghz) according to a published protocol (see, Pang, Y. -P. et al, J. Comput. Chem. 22: 1720-1771 (2001)). The translational and rotational increments at the first stage were 1.0 A and 10 degrees of arc, respectively, and default increments were used at the second stage. A cutoff of -30 kcal/mol for intermolecular interaction energies was used. The 236,925 small molecules were selected from an in-house database of 2.5 million small molecules using the criterion that each selected molecule has a molecular weight less than 301. All small molecules to be screened were protonated or deprotonated according to physiological pH of 7.4 and their three-dimensional structures and atomic charges were obtained from AMI semi-empirical calculations. Conformations of RTA and small molecules were not allowed to change during docking. A docking box (6.0x3.5x6.0 A\n3\n) was defined to confine the translation of the mass centre of each molecule within the active site of RTA crystal structure (PDB code: HFS). The box was surrounded by AsplOO, He- 104, Asp75, Asn78, Tyr80, Val82, Phe93, Glyl20, Glyl21, Asnl22, His94, Pro95, and Asp96 whose conformations are as defined in the HFS crystal structure (region I) or by Tyr80, Val81, Phe93, Glyl21, Asnl22, Tyrl23, Ilel72, Argl80, Ala79, Serl76, Glul77, and Leul26 whose conformations were defined in the HFS crystal structure (region II). All water molecules and the bound adenine were removed from the RTA crystal structure. Arg213 of RTA adopts the conformation uniquely defined in the HFS crystal structure. Compounds provided herein had a EUDOC energy of <-54 \n\n kcal/mol obtained from a virtual screening study. Compounds showing in vitro anti- ricin activities were further derivatized, through visual inspection of the EUDOC- generated inhibitor-RTA complexes, by adding functional groups such as a hydroxyl or alkyl group to improve their intermolecular interactions.\n\n\nExample 2: Testing small-molecule inhibitors ofricin using a cell-free in vitro translation assay with a luciferase reporter\n\n\nCompounds 1-1, IV-5, IV-7, IH-I, VII-2, 1-3, 1-5, II-3, 11-13, VII- 13, IV-IO, II- 2, IV-3, II- 12, VII-3, V-21, IV-9, VII-I, V-I, IV- 19, 1-4 and IV-I were tested for inhibition ofricin using a cell-free in vitro translation assay as described previously and as further described below. A yeast cell- free translation-competent extract was prepared in the lab based on the method presented by Iizuka and Sarnow (see, Iizuka, N. and Sarnow, P., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 11(4):353— 360 (1997)). W303 yeast (killer virus minus strain) cells were grown in liquid culture media (YPD). Cells were spun down and washed three times in WCE-Mannitol. Yeast cells were broken open by vortexing in the presence of glass beads and WCE-PMSF- Mannitol. Small inhibitory compounds were removed by chromatography (Sephadex™ G-25). The 60-90 OD\n26\nO fractions were collected from the column and this represents the yeast cell-free extract used in the translation assay. Capped luciferase RNA was produced using the Epicenter AmpliCap T7 Kit (AC0707) and was added to the yeast extract to provide the RNA template for translation. Each compound was prepared in 100% DMSO. Working solutions of the compounds (3 mM) were then prepared at a final DMSO concentration of 10%. The final DMSO concentration for every in vitro translation reaction was standardized to 0.67% DMSO. RTA was incubated with the compound (equimolar concentration, 20 nM) on ice for 20 min. prior to addition to the in vitro translation mixture. As a negative control, cycloheximide was used as a translation inhibitor in the in vitro assay instead ofricin, to identify small molecules that may affect other steps in translation (other than ribosome depurination). The reaction was run at 23 \n0\nC for 1 hour. The assay has been successfully carried out in the 96-well format using 15 or 30 μL volumes per well. Following the 1 hour incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μL TBS buffer. White 96 microwell plates (Nunc 236105) were used to setup the luminometer assay. \n\n Briefly, 20 μL of the diluted translation assay mixture was added to a well of the plate. The amount of active luciferase protein (indicating translation efficiency of the in vitro reaction) is measured using the Biotek 96 well-plate luminometer. The system was set up such that the automatic injector added 100 μL of Promega's luciferase assay reagent (LAR) to each well (2 second delay, 10 second integrated light measurement).\n\n\nFigures 1 presents the in vitro translation assay results for compound 1-1. This compound had a moderate effect on the background (35% reduction relative to the control) and a large effect on inhibition of RTA (15.2 fold decrease in inhibition relative to the toxin only treatment). The data are presented both with and without background correction (blue= raw data, red = adjusted data). Figures 2-11 represent results for compounds IV-5, IV-7, III- 1 , VII-2, 1-3, 1-5, II-3, 11-13, VII- 13, and IV-10, respectively (20 nM equimolar concentration test). Figures 12-22 represents results for compounds II-2, IV-3, 11-12, VII-3, V-21, IV-9, VII-I, V-I, IV- 19, 1-4 and IV-I (20 nM equimolar concentration test). According to the in vitro translation assay, the IC\n50\n values of IV-3, V-21, IV-9, and IV-8 for inhibiting RTA were estimated to be 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 nM, and 0.1 nM, respectively.\n\n\nExample 3: Testing small-molecule inhibitors ofShiga-like toxin using a cell-free in vitro translation assay with a luciferase reporter\n\n\nAn in vitro cell-free bioassay was developed to screen for small-molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activity of Shiga toxin 2. The bioassay is based on a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free lysate (RRL) system. The in vitro screen can be used to determine if the inhibitor acts at the level of translation. The following describes the in vitro cell-free translation assay. The assay was applied to compounds 1-1, 1-2, IV- 5, and IV-6.\n\n\nThe RRL assay was developed using 2:1 RRL obtained from Green Hectares (Oregon, Wis.). The RRL was supplemented with the same ATP regeneration system used for the yeast in vitro translation assays (Iizuka and Sarnow, 1997). The assay was performed identically as in Example 2 except the reaction is incubated at 30° C for 1 hour. Uncapped luciferase RNA was produced using the Epicenter AmpliScribe T7 kit (AS3107) and was added to the RRL to provide the RNA template for translation. The test compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO. Working solutions \n\n of the compounds (3 niM) were then prepared at a final DMSO concentration of 10%. The final DMSO concentration for every in vitro translation reaction was standardized to 0.67% DMSO. Shiga-like toxin 2 (Stx2) was incubated with the compound (equimolar concentration, 10 nM) on ice for 20 min. prior to addition to the in vitro translation mixture. As a negative control, cycloheximide was used as a translation inhibitor in the in vitro assay instead of Stx2, to identify small molecules that may affect other steps in translation (other than ribosome depurination).\n\n\nThe reaction was run at 30° C for 1 hour. The assay was successfully carried out in the 96-well format using 15 or 30 μL volumes per well. Following the 1 hour incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μL TBS buffer. White 96 microwell plates (Nunc 236105) were used to setup the luminometer assay. Briefly, 20 μL of the diluted translation assay mixture was added to a well of the plate. The amount of active luciferase protein (indicating translation efficiency of the in vitro reaction) was measured using the Biotek 96 well-plate luminometer. The system was set up such that the automatic injector added 100 μL of Promega's luciferase assay reagent (LAR) to each well (2 second delay, 10 second integrated light measurement). According to the above-described in vitro translation assay, IV-3, V-21, IV-9, and IV-8 showed a 18-, 14-, 9- and 7-fold decrease of the inhibition caused by Stx2 relative to the toxin only treatment at a drug concentration of 10 nM (Figure 23).\n\n\nExample 4: Testing small-molecule inhibitors ofricin using a colorimetric-based mouse myeloma cell viability assay\n\n\nRTA antagonists were tested at three different concentrations (0.3, 3, or 30 μM) under three different types of assays: (a) cells+RTA inhibitors+ricin mixed together at the same time (neutralization); (b) cells+RTA inhibitors preincubated before ricin challenge (pre-treat); (c) cells+ricin preincubated for some time before adding ricin inhibitors (rescue). The antagonists were incubated with Ie4 Sp2/0-Agl4 (Sp2) mouse myeloma cells in hybridoma serum- free medium for 3 hrs at 37° C in 96- well microplates. Ricin was added to the cells to yield 40 pg/mL final concentration and the mixtures were further incubated overnight. Metabolic activity of the cells were determined using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). The results are expressed in percent of the metabolic activity of Sp2 cells incubated \n\n under the same conditions in the absence of ricin and RTA antagonists. All experiments were made in six parallels.\n\n\nSpecifically, mouse myeloma Sp2/0-Agl4 (CRL- 1581, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia) cells were pre-grown to early-mid log phase in Hybridoma Serum Free Medium (HSFM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) supplemented with 4 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen), 0.5% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin mix (Invitrogen). Cells were collected with low-speed centrifugation (1,500 rpm in a Sorvall RT-6000 centrifuge, Thermo Electron Corp., Ashville, North Carolina) at 4 \n0\nC for 15 minutes, resuspended in fresh HSFM and plated in the wells of 96-well sterile microplates (Costar 3595) to result in 2.5e+5/mL final cell density. The cells were incubated in the absence of any other additives (Viability Control), in the presence of 50 pg/mL ricin (Vector, Burlingame, California) (Ricin Inhibition Control), in the presence of the test substance (30, 3 and 0.3 μM) (Substance Toxicity Control) and in the combined presence of the above amounts of ricin and test substances (Test) in 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere with 100% relative humidity at 37 \n0\nC for 18 hours. MTS/PMS from the Cell Titer 96 AQuaeous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) mix was added to the cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the plates were read at 490 nm after further incubation for 4 hours. The data was transformed by subtracting the OD490 data obtained with the Ricin Inhibition Control from all OD490 values where ricin was present. Cell viabilities in at least 3 parallel wells containing the mixtures of ricin and tests substances were calculated by expressing the OD490 values in per cent of the OD490 values of at least 3 parallel wells of Viability Control (% Viability). A positive % Viability value, exceeding the intra-assay variance obtained with the Ricin Inhibition Control was taken as the indication of the ricin antagonist effect of the test substance. A % Viability value in the Substance Toxicity Control less than the value obtained in Viability Control was a direct measure of the cell toxic nature of the test substance. A negative value in Test was also indicative of the toxicity of the substance. If this negative value was not coupled with a decreased % Viability in Substance Toxicity Control, then the substance was toxic only in the presence of ricin. The results show that compounds present in the top 10 for anti-ricin activity in all three assay types (neutralization, pre-treat and rescue) included: V-I, IV-9, and IV- 3. IV-7 was in the top 10 for activity in two assay types (neutralization and rescue). \n\n The following substances were among the top 10 for activity in a single assay type: IV-8 (neutralization), V-21 (pre-treat) and IV-I (rescue). IV-3, V-21, IV-9, and IV-8 showed 1.4, 8.8, 6.6, and 4.4% cell protection against ricin at a drug concentration of 300 nM, respectively (Figure 24).\n\n\nExample 5: Testing small-molecule inhibitors ofStx2 using a colorimetric-based Vero cell viability assay\n\n\nUsing the same assay described in Example 4 except that Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) replaced Sp2/0-Agl4, IV-3, V-21, IV-9, IV-61, IV-59 and IV-8 showed 15 to 20% cell protection against Stx2 at drug concentration of 300 nM (see Figures 25 and 27).\n\n\nExample 6: Solution and solid-phase syntheses of compounds of Formula IV-A\n\n\nCompounds according to Formula IV-A can be prepared by solution and solid- phase syntheses as exemplified in Schemes 1 and 2 below.

The invention provides compositions for the induction of TuI 7 responses containing a TLR agonist and an apoptotic cell-associated agent or containing a microbe-infected apoptotic cell. The compositions of the present invention may also contain dendritic cells capable of inducing Tu 17 responses. In other embodiments, the invention provides compositions for the inhibition of TH17 responses containing one or more blocking agents. Methods and compositions for the modulation of TH 17 responses and for the treatment of TH 17-associatcd diseases and for cancer arc also provided\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[003] The citation and/or discussion of cited references in this section and throughout the specification is provided mercty to clarify the description of the present invention and is not an admission that any such reference is \"prior art\" to the present invention.\n\n\n1004] Adaptive immune responses rely on differentiation of CD4 T helper cells inco subsets with distinct effector functions best suited for host defense against an invading pathogen. Intcrlcukin (IL)-17 producing T helper cells (TnI 7) arc a recently identified subset, separate from the T helper type 1 (TuI ) and T helper type 2 (TH2) subsets\n1\n. The TH 17 response is a pro-inflammatory T cell response that is associated with the release of IL- 17 and IL-23 cytokines. It has been closely associated with immunity in response to TLR-activated microbial infections and has been reported in a variety of autoimmune conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. Studies have shown that inhibitory \n\n antibodies to IL- 17 or mice deficient in IL- 17 responses are able to suppress or prevent the Tu 17 response in disease models for gastrointestinal immunity, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n1005 J Generation of Tn 17 responses is also thought to be favored at mucosal sites for protective immunity. Importantly, mucosal sites represent a primary target for delivery of vaccines, because most infections affect or start from a mucosal surface. Moreover, often in these infections, application of a vaccine directly to the mucosal surface is required to induce an effective, protective immune response [Holmgren, J. and C. Czerkinsky, Nat Med (2005) 1 1(4 Suppl):S45-53|, since induction of peripheral immune responses by parenteral immunization does not result in significant mucosal immunity [Kiyono, H., et al. Reg Immunol, (1992) 4(2):54-62; McGhee, J.R., et al.. Vaccine, (1992) 10(2):75-88],\n\n\n[006J The effort that has been focused thus far on inducing effective immune responses in mucosal tissues has met with considerable challenge, since most protein antigens (Ags) are rather weak immunogens when given via the mucosal route. The coadministration of mucosal adjuvants, such as cholera toxin (CT), has been shown to effectively support Ag-specifϊc mucosal immune responses, however, the inherent toxicity of cholera toxin is a major hindrance to its use in humans. Thus, the development of other, effective and reliable mucosal adjuvants, that preferably induce T\nH\nI 7 responses, is of central importance for new generation vaccines jMcGhec, J.R., ct al. Vaccine ( 1992) 10(2)75-88]. However, it is important to recognize that tight regulation of these T\nH\n 17 responses must also be achieved, since Tn 17 responses are also associated with driving a number of autoimmune diseases. Thus, it is critical that the factors that govern differentiation of T\nH\nI 7 cells in vivo be better understood, so that ThI 7 responses may be carefully regulated.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[007] In certain embodiments of the present invention, a microbe-infected apoptotic cell that expresses an exogenous immune antigen is provided.\n\n\n[ 008 J In other embodiments of the present invention an isolated T\nH\n 17-inducing dendritic cell (DC) that secretes interleukin-6 (EL-6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), is provided, wherein the combined amount of IL-6 and TGF-β is effective for inducing a Tn 17 response.

of immune adjuvants that induces a T\nH\n 17 response in vitro and in vivo. More specifically, the present invention provides methods for regulating TuI7 responses based on this discovery. In certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention arc useful for inducing Tjjl 7 responses. In other embodiments, the compositions of the invention are useful for inhibiting Tn 17 responses and for inducing immune tolerance.\n\n\n[ 060 J Also provided by the present invention arc pharmaceutical formulations and vaccine compositions useful for modulating Tn 17 responses. \n\n Characteristics ofCD4 T cell subsets\n\n\n[061 ] CD4 T cells upon activation and expansion develop into different T helper (Tn) cell subsets with different cytokine profiles and distinct effector functions. Appropriate differentiation of TH cells into effector subsets best suited for host defense against an invading pathogen is of critical importance to the immune system. CD4 T cells differentiate into at least four known subsets, three effector subsets (TnI , Tn2 and THI 7) and one T regulatory subset (T«\ng\n).\n\n\n[ 0621 Based on the cytokines that they produce, T cells were historically divided into THI and Tπ2 cells, and this has provided a framework to understand how specific cytokine milieus produced by cells of the innate immune system guide the development of adaptive immunity. TnI cells, which are potently induced by dendritic cells (DC) secreting IL-12, are characterized by the expression of the lineage-specific transcription factor T-bet (T box 21) and the production of IFN-γ. Tn2 cells, which depend on 1L-4 during differentiation and lack of IL- 12, produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL- 13 and arc characterized by the expression of the transcription factor OATA-3. Importantly, in the past five years, a third subset of IL-17-producing effector T helper cells, called TH 17 cells, has been discovered and characterized.\n\n\n[063] Tιil7 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F, and TL-22. By secreting these effector cytokines, TnI 7 cells induce a massive tissue reaction due to the broad distribution of the IL- 17 and IL-22 receptors. THI 7 cells also secrete 1L-21 to communicate with the cells of the immune system. Synergy between the cytokines transforming growth factor beta isofomi 1 (TGF-β) and interleukin (lL)-6 induces development of Tnl7 cells in mice\n10\"12\n and humans\n13\n, while IL-23 supports expansion of these cells\n10'12\n. IL-23 consists of two subunits, the pl9 subunit and the p35 subunit. The p35 subunit is also used by IL- 12, which is a heterodimer consisting of the p35 and the p4() subunit. The differentiation factors (TGF-β plus IL-ό or IL-21), the growth and stabilization factor (IL-23), and the transcription factors (STAT3, ROR-γt (ROR-c), and ROR-a) involved in the development of Tn 17 cells have only recently been identified. The participation of TGF-β in the differentiation of TH17 cells places the Tπl7 lineage in close relationship with CD4\n~\nCD25Toxp3^ regulatory T cells (T\nreg\n) since TGF-β also induces differentiation of naive T cells into Foxp3\n~\n T\nreg\n in the peripheral immune compartment. The investigation of \n\n the differentiation, effector function, and regulation of T\nT\n{I7 cells has opened up a new framework for understanding T cell differentiation. While the importance of Tn 17 cells in clearing pathogens during host defense reactions and in inducing tissue inflammation in autoimmune disease has been appreciated [Reviewed in Korn, T. ct al. (2009) Annual Review of Immunology, 27:485-517|, the exact nature of the stimuli that induce their differentiation in vivo is not known.\n\n\n1064] Tieg cells arc a specialized subpopulation of T cells that act to suppress activation of the immune system and thereby maintain immune system homeostasis and tolerance to sclf-antigcπs. Development of T\nicg\n cells, which arc capable of suppressing autoimmune disease, is therefore reciprocally related to Tn 17 cells,\n10\n which can drive immune responses, including autoimmune responses. T\ntes\n cells can be identified by their unique expression of the transcriprion factor forklicad box P3 (Foxp3).\n19\n Importantly, there arc two phcnotypically identical populations of CD4\n\"\nCD25 T,\ncg\n — natural and adaptive. Natural CD4\n'\nCD25\nJ\n T\nreg\n cells arise in the thymus under homeostatic conditions to safeguard against autoimmunity. Adaptive CD4\n\"\nCD25\n\"\"\n T\nieg\n cells arise during inflammatory processes such as infections and cancers and suppress immunity through heterogeneous mechanisms that include direct contact or the production of soluble factors such as IL-10 and TGF-β.\n\n\n[065] T\nrei\n, cells are thought to be involved in cancer. The tumor itself and cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as DC, induce the differentiation of Ti\neg\n cells through various mechanisms including the production of TGF-β and the expression of the costimuiatory molecule B7-H1. At least some tumor-associated T\nreg\n cells are specific for tumor antigens, although once activated, they can also suppress tumor antigen-independent immune responses though bystander mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that T\nieg\n cells actively accumulate in the human ovarian cancer microenvironment, inhibiting tumor- specific cytotoxicity and cytokine production by tumor-specific CD8\n\"\n T cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, certain studies have shown that the number of CT>TCD25\n~\nFoxp3\n~\n T cells correlates inversely with clinical outcomes in several epithelial carcinomas, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. [Curicl et al. (2007) Clin Invest. 1 17(5): 067-1 174]. In one study, there was an inverse correlation between the number of T\nrea\n cells in the tumor and patient survival, which was corroborated independently by the demonstration that high levels of Foxp3 in the tumor \n\n microenvironment predicted reduced survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Thus, in ovarian cancer, for example, it would be useful to be able to inhibit development of T\nreg\n responses, for example, through the induction of TnI 7 responses. The present invention provides such methods.\n\n\n[0661 While the presence of T\nreg\n cells is thought to be harmful in some cancers, as discussed above, in others it may be helpful. For example, the situation in hematologic malignancies differs. Increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating Foxp3\n\"\n T cells predicts improved survival in individuals with follicular lymphoma, and reduced numbers of Foxp3\nT\n cells predicts poor survival in individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma. Both the number and the function of Foxp3 \n'\n T\nrcg\n cells was reduced in patients with multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, and T\nreg\n cell function decreased as tumor burden increased in a small series of patients with cutaneous T cell leulcemia/lymphoma. Therefore, it is possible that the effects of T\nteg\n cells or the differentiation of Foxp3\n\"\n cells into functional T\nreg\n cells fundamentally differs in lymphoid malignancies compared with epithelial carcinomas. These studies indicate that in certain circumstances, it would be useful to be able to induce T,\neg\n cell responses, likely through the modulation of Tn 17 responses, in order to treat cancer. The present invention provides such methods.\n\n\n[Q67J In certain embodiments, the epithelial or mixed epithelial carcinomas that may be treated by methods of the present invention include ovarian cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung carcinoma, laryngeal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, epithelial carcinomas of the upper aerodigestivc tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lyrnphoepithelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumors of the kidney, and renal angiomyoadenomatous tumors.\n\n\nGeneration of \"FyI 7 cells\n\n\n[0681 Tn 17 cells have been known to be induced in vitro by TGF-β and IL-ό\nι~\n\\ However, it was not known what conditions in vivo would induce this combination of cytokines. Furthermore, it is enigmatic that a combination of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines would be required to generate an effector TH 17 response. The present invention shows that the relevant physiological stimulus triggering tins combination of TnI 7-inducing cytokines is the recognition and phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells \n\n by DC. Phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells uniquely triggers the combination of IL-6 and TGF-β through recognition of a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) (e.g.. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands/' and an apoptotic-cell associated agent (such as, e.g., phosphatidylscrinc exposed on apoptotic cells'), respectively. Conversely, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in the absence of microbial signals induces differentiation of the closely related regulatory T-cells (T\nreg\n), which arc important for controlling autoimmunity\n8\n.\n\n\n1069] A surprising discover}' of the present invention was that the TLR ligand (or other PAMP) and the apoptotic-ccll associated agent must be associated as a single entity (e.g., as a microbe-infected apoptotic cell) in order to generate a T\nH\n 17-inducing DC. Coadministration of the TLR ligand and apoptotic cell-associated agent did not generate a T\nH\nI 7-inducing DC. Moreover, blocking apoptosis during infection of the intestinal epithelium with the rodent pathogen Citrobactur rυdenthtm*\n*\n impaired the characteristic Tn 17 response in the lamina propria. The results of the present disclosure demonstrate that infected apoptotic cells are a critical component of the innate immune signals instructing TH 17 differentiation, and point to pathogens particularly adept at triggering apoptosis that might preferential Iy induce Tπl7-mcdiated immunity.\n\n\n[0701 The coding sequences and amino acid sequences for human and murine IL-6, IL- 10, IL- 12 p35 and p40 subunits, IL-22, IL-23a pi 9 subunif, TGF-β ϊ, Foxp3, TNFsflS, IL-17A, IL-17F, Tbet (TBX21 ).

The innate immune system in mammals senses the invasion of microorganisms using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the family of TLRs, which recognize conserved microbial components, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Activation of TLRs leads to the induction of inflammatory responses and the development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. [Reviewed in Takeda, K. et al.

TLRs are characterized by an extracellular domain composed of leucinc-rich- repeat motifs for ligand binding as well as an IL-I receptor domain (termed TIR domain). \n\n TLR intracellular domains specifically recruit several adaptor proteins including MyD88, TRlF, TlRAPMkL. TOLLlP, and/or TRAM for downstream signaling. These adaptor proteins subsequently associate with a family of IL-I receptor associated kinases {IRAKI, 2, M, and 4). Recruitment of numerous downstream signaling proteins leads to activation of a range of transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP-I, and IRFs, which are responsible for specific gene transcription, including the genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-] 0, 1L-17, and TGF-β. Despite significant domain conservation, distinct TLRs or combinations of TLR hetcrodimers induce gene programs that lead not only to the robust production of general proinflammatory mediators but also to the production of unique effectors, which provide pathogen-tailored immune responses.\n\n\nfO73] Biochemical studies and genetic analyses using transgenic mice have revealed specific ligands for the activation of TLRs. Of the 1 1 TLRs described, the ligands for 10 of the receptors have been identified. TLRl. TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 (both as hetcrodimers and homodimcrs) recognize different microbial structures, whereas TLR3 recognizes viral double stranded RNA (dsRNA). TLR5 recognizes Flagellin, a protein found in die flagclla of gram-negative bacteria. TLR7 and 8 recognize cndosomal single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) to detect infection by vims, and TLR9 detects unmethylated CpG motifs, characteristic of bacterial DNA. TLRl 1, present in mice, but not humans, senses the profϊlin-likc proteins from the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and also recognizes uropathogenic E. coli.\n\n\n[074j In certain embodiments of the invention, the requirement for TLR signaling for the generation of a response to an antigen or microbial pathogen or product is tested in vivo using genetically engineered \"knockout\" mice. For example. TLR4 knockout {TLR4 \n\" \"\n) mice are homozygous null for the full-length TLR4 gene. Accordingly, these mice do not express functional TLR4 protein and therefore cannot detect TLR4 ligands, such as, e.g., lipopolysacchari.de (LPS) through TLR4. In other knockout mice, adaptor molecules that arc downstream of TLRs in the signaling pathway are targeted for deletion. For example, MyD88 \n\" \"\n mice do not express the MyDSS adaptor protein, and arc deficient in most TLR signaling pathways. It has been discovered that some TLRs do not depend entirely, or at all, on MyD88, however, because the signal is transmitted through another adaptor molecule. TRIF. Thus. TRIF \n\" '\n mice have been generated to determine which TLRs depend on TRIF for signaling (such as, e.g., TLR3). It has also been shown that when MyD88 \n\"\n'\n\"\n TRIF \n\"\n'\n\"\n \n\n double knockout mice are used {i.e., they express neither functional MyD88 nor TRIF proteins), all TLR signaling is completely abrogated. [See, Kawai T and Akira S. (2007) Serain Immunol; 19:24-32; Modzhitov R. (2007) Nature; 449:819-26|.\n\n\n[075] TLRs arc expressed on a wide variety of cells in mammals, including on cells of the innate (such as antigen-presenting cells (APC)) and adaptive immune systems. The DC is an APC that is of critical importance for the initiation of adaptive immune responses. DC reside systemicaMy, in lymph nodes, and in tissues, where they arc poised for early detection of microbial invasion, and to signal the invasion to the adaptive arm of the immune system (i.e., to T and B cells). However, DC reside in an immature state, and in this state they are unable to stimulate T cell activation. It is through recognition of microbial pathogens or products by PRRs (especially TLRs), expressed on their cell surface or intracellularly, that acth'ation of these cells is facilitated (upon, e.g., phagocytosis of the invading pathogen or an associated antigen). Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by DC is described in detail in Blander, J. M. and Medzhitov, R., Science (2004) 304 (5673): 1014.\n\n\n[076] Upon TLR ligation, DC undergo a program of maturation whereby they upregulate costimυlatory molecules (e.g., CD80, CD86, CD40 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type I and type II molecules), which are critical for T cell activation, and they migrate to the draining lymph node associated with the assaulted tissue. In the draining lymph node, the mature DC present peptides from the phagocytosed pathogen in the context of surface MHC molecules to naive T cells in the draining lymph node, leading to T cell activation. \"Naϊve T cells\" are T cells which have never encountered the antigen for which their unique T cell receptor is specific.\n\n\n[077] Importantly, in the draining lymph nodes, mature DC secrete cytokines that regulate naϊve CD4 T cell activation and differentiation into effector subsets. For example, in response to TLR ligation, DC express the cytokine IL-6, a pro-inftammatory cytokine that is critical for T cell activation. Moreover, DC are known to secrete IL- 12 in response to certain TLR4 ligands, such as LPS. IL- 12 is a pro-Tπl cytokine, and culture of naϊve CD4 T celts with IL-12 and APC leads to their differentiation in vitro into THI effector cells. [See, Manetti R, et al. (1993) J Exp Med: Apr 1 ;177(4):1 199-204.] DC are also capable of secreting other cytokines, including TGF-β, IL- 10, and IL-23, in response to specific stimuli. \n\n |078| In certain embodiments of the invention, the niRNA expression of cytokines and other genes is quantified. For the isolation of JRMA, any suitable means known in the art may be used. This includes phenol-chloroform extraction followed by cthanol or 2- propanol precipitation. Certain commercial reagents, such as TRIzoW* reagent arc well known in the art and may be used according to the manufacturer's instructions for the isolation of RNA.\n\n\n1079} The present invention, in certain aspects, provides methods for inducing DCs to secrete specific combinations of cytokines, either m vitro or in vivo, based on the discovery of certain stimuli that arc capable of inducing such combinations. These stimuli include TLR agonists in combination with apoptotic cells or apoptotic-cell-associated agents.\n\n\n(0801 \"TLR agonist\" or \"TLR adjuvant'\n\"\n is understood to mean a natural TLR ligand, a TLR ligand mimic, a synthetic or chemical TLR ligand, a ceil or particle including a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, a microbial pathogen, a bacterium, and a vims or viral and viral-like particle. Moreover, it is well known in the art that TLRs may be expressed on the cell surface, or iπtracellularly. such as, e.g., in endosomes. Moreover, TLRs may function as heterodimers (e.g., as a TLRl /2 and TLR2/6 hcterodimcrs) or as homodimcrs (e.g., as a TLR4/4 homodimcr). TLRs may also function as monomers.\n\n\nI OS 1 ] TLR agonists may be synthetic chemical or natural ligands of TLRs. TLR agonists include, but are not limited to, Pam3CysSerLys4(CSK4) (for TLR1/2); Lipoarabinomannan, LPS P.gingivahs as well as LPS from Gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan (PGN) (e.g., from S.auraus), heat killed forms of microbial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM). lipotεichoic acid (LTA) (e.g. from S.auraus), triacylated bacterial lipopcptides (for TLR 1/2), diacylatcd lipopeptidcs (for TLR2/6), and Malp-2 (for TLR2); Poly(I:C) and dsRNA (for TLR3); LPS (from Gram-negative bacteria such as E. colϊ) Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLAp). heat shock protein (HSP) 60, and extra domain A of fibroncctin (EDA) (for TLR4); Flagcllin (for TLR5); FSL-I (for TLR2/6); Imiquimod, Loxoribine, Gardiquimod™, and E.coli RNA/LyoVcc (for TLR7); ssRNA, polytl PolyU/LyoVec, Gardiquimod™, and £.cfl// RNA/LyoVcc (for TLR8); CpG oligodcoxynuclcotides (ODN) (for TLR9); and profϊlin from T. gondii and uropathogenic E. coli (for TLRI l). \n\n [082] In certain embodiments, the invention relates to compositions for inducing Tu 17 responses which include an apoptotic cell or apoptotic cell-associated agent. Apoptosis is an active process of cell suicide involving the action of a number of caspase proteins that leads to ordered destruction of the cells and their safe disposal by professional (macrophages and immature DC) and in some cases nonprofessional (such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells) phagocytes. The removal of apoptotic cells is the final step and perhaps the ultimate objective of the apoptotic program. Apoptosis is a ubiquitous process and plays a key role in many fundamental biological events, including embryonic development, normal tissue homeostasis, development of the immune system and resolution of inflammation. In addition, apoptotic cells are a potential source of self- antigens, and defective clearance of cell corpses has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [Botto et al. (2004) Arthritis Res Ther; 6:147-1501.\n\n\n1083] Dying, apoptotic cells can provide specific signals that enable recruitment and recognition by phagocytes (e.g., DC). Apoptosis is characterized by a variety of morphological features such as loss of membrane asymmetry and attachment, condensation of the cytoplasm and nucleus, and internucleosomal cleavage of DNA. One of the earliest indications of apoptosis is the translocation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylscrinc is a key apoptosis mediator. Receptors for phosphatidyl serine continue to be discovered, however, they include the phosphatidylserine receptor as well as Tim proteins, such asTiml and Tim4. fMiyanishi M, ct al (2007) Nature. 450:435-9; Kobayashi N., et al. (2007) Immunity. 27:927-40J. Thus, the present invention contemplates targeting any receptor shown to be involved in the recognition of phosphatidylserine. Once exposed to the extracellular environment, binding sites on phosphatidylserine become available and can recruit phagocytic cells.\n\n\n1084] In tlic present invention, the term \"apoptotic cell\" is understood to include a cell having lost integrity of its plasma membrane, a cell having exposed phosphatidylserine residues, translocated calreticulin to its cell surface, adsorbed soluble proteins such as CIq and thrombospondin, or exhibiting other \"eat rnc\" signals (i.e., signals to a phagocytic cell to \"eat\" or phagocytose the apoptotic cell), a cell having suppressed \"do not cat me\" (i.e., \"do not phagocytose me\") signals such as suppression of surface CD47 expression, a cell having complete pcrmcabilization of its outer mitochondrial membrane, a cell having lost \n\n mitochondrial membrane potential, a cell having caspase activation, a cell having ΔΨm dissipation, a cell having a nucleus that has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies frequently referred to as \"apoptotic bodies\" and measured by quantification of hypodxploid events (sub-Gl peak), a cell having nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), a cell labeling positively for terminal dcoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNELj, a cell triggered to undergo apoptosis through different biochemical routes (the \"intrinsic\" or the \"extrinsic\" pathway, with or without the contribution of mitochondria), a cell exhibiting typical apoptotic morphology defined by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, karyorrhexis, little or no ultrastructural modifications of cytoplasmic organelles, plasma membrane blebbing (but maintenance of its integrity until the final stages of the process) and cngulfment by phagocytes.\n\n\n1085] As used herein, the term ''apoptotic cell-associated agent\" refers to an entire apoptotic cell, or, to molecular components of an apoptotic cell, to phospholipids (<?.#., pliosphatidyiserine) and intracellular proteins such as caireticulin or polypeptides that arc exposed outside their normal intracellular compartments during apoptosis, (i.e., on the outer cell membrane), to synthetic apoptotic cell mimics, or to any apoptotic cell derived ligand recognized by a receptor specific to the apoptotic cell derived ligand and expressed by the DC or macrophage. This apoptotic celi-associated agent or mimic would trigger specific receptors triggering the same signaling pathways that an apoptotic cell would otherwise trigger in a DC, macrophage or other phagocytic cell, recognizing that apoptotic cell or engaged in phagocytosis of that apoptotic cell\n\n\n1086] In certain embodiments of the invention, cell lines arc used to study apoptosis. For example, the B cell lymphoma cell line A20 (ATCC number TIB-208) may be treated with anti-Fas antibody (anti-CD95) to induce apoptosis. The Fas receptor (also known as Apo-] or CD95) binds the Fas ligand (FasL), a transmembrane protein part of the TNF family. The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the death- inducing signaling complex (DISC), which contains the FADD. caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells, processed caspasc-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis. In other types of cells, the Fas-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8. Thus, cells, such as A20 cells, \n\n expressing Fas ligand on their cell surface undergo apoptotic cell death upon cross-linking of Fas, either by Fas ligand or by anti-Fas antibodies.\n\n\n1087] In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the TLR ligand is incorporated directly into the apoptotic cell. The TLR ligand may be recognized by cell surface TLR, such as, e.g., TLR-1, 2, or 4, or may be recognized by an cndosomal TLR, such as, e.g. TLR-3, 7, or 8.\n\n\n1088] In other embodiments, apoptotic neutrophils are generated in vivo by the intraperitoneal injection of thiogly collate. Upon thioglycollatc injection, neutrophils arc recruited to the inflamed injection site. Once, recruited, neutrophils which arc short-lived cells, live only a matter of days, and soon begin undergoing apoptosis. These cells may be isolated and used for study. Thioglycollatc may also be mixed with live E. coli and this mixture can be injected intrapcritoncally. In this case, neutrophils recruited to the peritoneal cavity will phagocytose the injected E. coli and undergo apoptosis. These latter neutrophils differ from the former (without E. coli) in that they have served in the studies supporting the present invention as a model for an infected apoptotic cell since they have phagocytosed E. coli and now undergo apoptosis carrying both signatures of TLR ligands and apoptotic cells.\n\n\n[089] In certain aspects of the invention, cell apoptosis is detected. Apoptosis may be detected by a variety of methods known in the art, including, but not limited to flow cytometric-based analysis of Annexin V expression on the cell surface. Annexin V is a 35- 36 kDa, Ca\" -dependent, phospholipid binding protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine. The translocation of phosphatidylserine precedes other apoptotic processes such as loss of plasma membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation. As such, Annexin V can be conjugated to biotin or to a fluorochrome such as FITC, PE, APC, Cy5, or Cy5.5, and used for the easy, flow cytometric identification of cells in the early stages of apoptosis.\n\n\n[090] Because phosphatidylserine translocation also occurs during necrosis, Annexin V is not an absolute marker of apoptosis. Therefore, it may be used in conjunction with vital dyes such as 7-arnino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) or propidium iodide (PI), which bind to nucleic acids, but can only penetrate the plasma membrane when membrane integrity is breached, as occurs in the later stages of apoptosis or in necrosis. Using these methods, \n\n cells that are negative for both Annexin V and the vital dye have no indications of apoptosis, since phosphatidylserme translocation has not occurred and the plasma membrane is still intact. Cells that are Annexin V-positivc and vital dye-negative, however, arc in early apoptosis as phosphatidylserme translocation has occurred, yet the plasma membrane is still intact. Cells that arc positive for both Annexin V and the vital dye arc cither in the late stages of apoptosis or arc already dead, as phosphatidylscrinc translocation has occurred and the loss of plasma membrane integrity is observed. When measured over time, Annexin V and a vital dye can be used to monitor the progression of apoptosis: from cell viability, to early-stage apoptosis, and finally to late-stage apoptosis and cell death.\n\n\n[091 J In certain other embodiments of the invention, apoptosis may also be assessed using TUNEL staining. The TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase [TdT |- rncdiatcd dUTP-digoxigenin nick -end labeling) method is based on the in sum labeling of DNA fragmentation sites in nuclei of intact fixed cells. DNA fragmentation is characteristic of apoptotic cells. TUNEL staining ma}' be performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR Red (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).\n\n\n1092] The use of synthetic mimics for the effects of apoptotic cells may be in the form of phosphatidylscrinc incorporated into liposomes, or agonists for nuclear hormone receptor supcrfamily member, Peroxisome Proliferators-Activated Receptor (PPAR)-y. A combination of TLR ligands with PPAR-γ agonists, for example, thiazolidincdiones (also referred to as glitazones) such as Rosiglitazonc. are examples of such synthetic agonists. Thiazolidincdiones arc used as therapy against various inflammatory diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and aπti-proliferativc effects. They arc also used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, it has been reported that recognition of apoptotic cells by cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages, results in the activation of PPAR-γ IJohann A.M. et. al. (2006) Cell Death Diff;13: 1533-i540|.\n\n\n[093] In certain other embodiments, a mimic of cell surface calreticulin translocation, including but not limited to inhibitors of flic protein phosphatase I/GADD34 complex, may be used to mimic cellular apoptosis.\n\n\n1094] In certain embodiments of the invention, an apoptotic cell or a microbe-infected apoptotic cell is engineered to express an exogenous immune antigen. As used herein \"exogenous'\n\"\n refers to a factor that is present and active in an individual organism or living \n\n cell but that originated outside of that organism, as opposed to an \"endogenous\" factor, which originates from the organism expressing the factor. As used herein, an \"exogenous immune antigen\" expressed by a microbe or expressed by a microbe-infected apoptotic cell refers to an antigen that is not endogenously expressed by the apoptotic cell. In certain embodiments, it is preferred that the exogenous immune antigen is expressed neither by the apoptotic cell nor by the microbe infecting die apoptotic cell. In other embodiments, it is preferred that the exogenous immune antigen is expressed endogenously by the microbe but is not expressed endogenously by the apoptotic cell. DNA introduced to cells via transfection or viral infection (transduction) is a non-limiting example of an exogenous factor. This method can be used to express an exogenous antigen by an apoptotic cell which is otherwise not expressed by the apoptotic cell. Non-limiting examples of an exogenous immune antigen include a tumor-associated antigen, and an antigen expressed by a microbe that could be used to elicit a TnI 7 immune response to the microbe, e.g., to induce effective host defense against the microbe as well as tissue repair. In certain embodiments of the invention, such as, e.g., vaccine compositions of the invention, an \"immune antigen\" is provided. As used herein, an \"immune antigen\" may be any antigen that elicits an immune response, and may be either an cxogenously or endogenously expressed antigen. Endogenous or exogenous (e.g. tumor associated antigen) expressed antigens would be used in the context of apoptotic cells alone as a regulatory T cell adjuvant where a regulatory T cell response is preferentially induced, while an exogenously expressed antigen such as a microbial antigen or a tumor-associated antigen would be used in the context of an apoptotic cell engineered to carry TLR ligands as a TH 17 adjuvant where a TH 17 immune response is preferentially induced.\n\n\n[095] Apoptotic cells may be engineered to express such exogenous immune antigens by any suitable method known in the art Examples of such methods include transfecting a suitable cell line or virus with the gene encoding the desired antigen or transforming a cell, such as, <?.#., a bacterium, with the gene encoding the desired antigen using a suitable virus. e.g. a lentivirus or an adenovirus. Apoptosis may then be induced in the fransfected or transformed cell before use. In other embodiments, a certain apoptotic cell may be selected for use because it endogenously (i.e., naturally) expresses a desired immune antigen. In other embodiments, a cell expressing a desired immune antigen is cither infected with a microbe, such as, e.g., E. coli, or allowed to internalize an inactivated form of a microbe such as E. coli. Apoptosis is then induced following infection or internalization of the \n\n microbe. In other embodiments, a cell can be made to express an antigen as a fusion protein with a TLR ligand such as Flagellin. Apoptosis is then induced, where the resultant apoptotic cell expresses the exogenous antigen directly fused to a TLR ligand. Apoptosis may be induced by a number of methods known in the art, including exposure to heat, UV, or fixation. The specific method of apoptosis induction will depend on the type of cell to be treated, and is readily determined by a skilled artisan.\n\n\n1096] According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the combinatorial use of PPAR-γ agonists and TLR Iigands provides a stimulus for T\nH\n 17 cell development. Specifically, PPAR-γ agonists and TLR iigands may be administered as one entity such as encapsulated within liposomes, e.g., in order to achieve co-internalization by DC into one subcellular compartment such as an cndosome or phagosome. f 09Tj In certain embodiments of the present invention, apoptosis may be inhibited using Q-VD-OPH, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. Q-VD-OPH is not toxic to cells even at extremely high concentrations, and consists of a carboxy terminal phcnoxy group conjugated to the amino acids valine and aspartate. The compound is a potent inhibitor of cell death by apoptosis and is significantly more effective in preventing apoptosis than ZVAD-fink and Boc-D-fmk. It is equally effective in preventing apoptosis mediated by the three major apoptotic pathways, caspase-9 and caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase- 10, and casρase-12. JCaserta TM et al (2003) Apoptosis 8(4): 345-352; Patil K and Sharma SC (2004) NcuroReport 15:981 -984; Yang L ct al. (2004) Neurobiology of Disease 17(2): 250- 259].\n\n\n[098J In some aspects, the present invention relates to compositions, pharmaceutical formulations or vaccine compositions that include specific combinations of the TLR agonists and apoptotic cells or apoptotic cell-associated agents described herein. In certain embodiments, TLR agonists and apoptotic cells are combined as a single entity by coadministration in one physical form as described herein. For example, a TLR ligand and an apoptotic cell-associated agent may be incorporated into liposomes such that each liposome carries both an apoptotic cell-associated agent (e.g., phosphatidylscrinc) and a TLR ligand. This composition endures co-delivery in one physical form and internalization into one subcellular compartment -within DC (e.g., cndosome or phagosome). In other embodiments, the combination of the two Tul7 adjuvants occurs naturally, and is administered as a single agent, such as, for example, a microbe-infected apoptotic cell or an \n\n apoptotic cell engineered to carry a TLR ligand. A microbe-infected apoptotic cell according to the present invention expresses markers of apoptosis suitable for eliciting TGF-β secretion by DC and TLR ligands suitable for eliciting IL-6 secretion by the same DC.\n\n\n[099] Any form or method of delivery, either in vitro or in vivo, that results in co- intemalization of both the TLR agonist and the apoptotic cell-associated agent by the same DC, or that results in stimulation of a DC such that the DC is induced to become a Tn 17- induciπg DC b)' exposure to the TLR agonist and the apoptotic cell-associated agent, is contemplated by the present invention.\n\n\n[01001 Non-limiting examples of microbe-infected cells that may be used in the present invention include cells infected with live attenuated vaccine strains such as Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine against tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi Ty21a vaccine against typhoid fever, and Vibrio cholerae CVD 103-HgR vaccine against cholera. Killed bacteria of all strains may also be used after inactivation with heat, UV or fixation. These may then be given to phagocytic cells and apoptosis of the cell induced after internalization of the inactivated microbe. In certain embodiments of the present invention, neutrophils infected with K. colt are used. E. coli infection of neutrophils causes them to become apoptotic, and the E. coli provides TLR ligands, thus representing an agent which combines both of the two necessary T\nH\n17 adjuvants.\n\n\n[0101 J Bacteria that cause significant apoptosis and tissue damage at epithelial surfaces during infection include, but are not limited to, Shigella dysenleriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC)\n\n\n10102] In certain embodiments, the invention relates to compositions that have a DC capable of inducing a TΗ17 response, wherein the DC secretes IL-6 and TGF-β. The DC composition may also include a microbe-infected apoptotic cell. The DC may phagocytose the microbe-infected apoptotic cell expressing exogenous immune antigens also administered to the DC. A killed microbe (inactivated, e.g., by heat, UV or fixative) may also be used because the DC will phagocytose this microbe, a method which delivers to the DC not only the relevant adjuvants for T\nH\nI 7 induction but also all the exogenous immune antigens unique to that microbe. Other microbes may include those selected for use as live \n\n attenuated vaccine strains such as Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine against tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi Ty21 a vaccine against typhoid fever, and Vibrio cholerae CVD 103-HgR vaccine against cholera.\n\n\n[0103] In certain embodiments, DC arc generated m vitro in bone marrow (BM)- dcrivcd GM-CSF DC cultures. Using this method, large numbers of BMDC may be generated by culturing whole BM cells in the presence of GM-CSF. The cultures are grown m RPMl supplemented with GM-CSF and 5% foetal bovine scram (FBS), plus 100 μg/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, I O mM HEPES, ! nM sodium pyruvate, IX MEM nonessential amino acids, and 2.5 μM β-mcrcaptocthanol (all from Sigma-Aldricn, St. Louis, MO). Semi -adherent cells are then harvested on ice on day 5 and re-plated immediately in fresh GM-CSF medium at 1x10\n6\n cells/well in 24-well tissue culture-treated plates and used for experiments.\n\n\n[0104J In the present invention, other phagocytic cells in addition to DC that are capable of inducing TH I 7 responses arc also contemplated.\n\n\n[0105] In certain embodiments of the present invention, in vitro experiments are carried out to assess the Ti\nf\n l 7-inducing potential of a DC. In certain embodiments, a DC is co-cultured directly with a T cell m vitro in the presence of a TLR agonist and apoptotic cell-associated stimuli of the present invention. In other embodiments, the DC is first treated with a TLR adjuvant and apoptotic cell-associated stimuli of the present invention, and then the DC conditioned media (CM) is collected and transferred to a well containing CD4 T cells stimulated with T cell activating agents {e.g., anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies). Tbc ability of a soluble factor secreted by the DC into the conditioned media to induce CD4 T cell differentiation may then be assessed. Such m vitro methods are widely accepted in the art as suitable models for characterizing the requirements for CD4 T cell differentiation in vivo.\n\n\n[Q 106J In certain embodiments of the present invention, T cell proliferation may be determined by measuring tritiated thymidine (Η-Thyrmdine) incorporation into dividing cells. As T cells proliferate, they incorporate the labeled nucleic acid into the dividing cells. The resulting radioactivity of the divided cells can be detected using a beta liquid scintillation counter. In the examples of the present disclosure, following 72 hours of co- culture, 1 μCi of Η-thymidinc is added to each culture well. Then. 18 hours after pulsing \n\n with \n3\nH-thymidine, cells are harvested with a multiple-sample harvester and counted with a Wallac 1450 microbeta PLUS liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA). Using this approach, the ability of DC to stimulate T cell proliferation can be quantitated.\n\n\n[0107] In certain embodiments of the present invention, naϊve CD4 T cells are isolated by cell sorting. Naϊvc CD4 T cells are identified by the levels of expression of certain cell surface markers. Specifically, these cells are CD62L\nhigl1\n CD44\nl(m\n CD25 cells that can be isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The CD4 T cells are stained with ftuorescently-conjugated antibodies specific for epitopes of CD62L, CD44, and CD25, and sorted based on their fluorescence properties to isolate the CD62L\nlll\n-\nal1\n CD44\n|OW\n CD25 population. This approach yields highly pure (>99%) populations of naϊvc CD4 T cells.\n\n\n[0108] In certain embodiments, intestinal cell damage is induced using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). DSS induces an inflammatory bowel disease-like colitis in animals. In addition to using DSS for the study of inflammation, numerous animal models exist for the study of colorectal and intestinal cancers in which mice are genetically manipulated or challenged with chemicals, such as DSS, to develop malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract. These models enable researchers to study the onset, progression of the disease, and understand in depth the molecular events that contribute to the development and spread of colorectal cancer. For example, human Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions in the large and small intestine. It is well known that chronic inflammation in the colon can cause cancer. Genetic mouse models for IBD- associated colon cancer include a model in which IL-IO knock out mice develop invasive adenocarcinoma in the colon, a model in which mice that are mutant for IL-2 and beta microglobulin genes have ulcerative colitis- like phenotypes and develop adenocarcinomas in the colon, and a model in which a mouse mutant for N-cadherin suffers IBD conditions and adenomas but docs not develop carcinomas.\n\n\nCompositions and Methods for Inhibiting a TnI 7 Response or Inducing Immune Tolerance\n\n\n[0109] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to methods for inhibiting TH 17 responses, and in other embodiments, the invention relates to methods for inducing immune tolerance in a mammal. These methods can involve administering to the DC an apoptotic cell in the absence of TLR ligands {e.g. an uninfected apoptotic cell), or administering an agent that blocks immune recognition of an apoptotic cell, or an apoptotic \n\n cell-associated agent. In yet other embodiments, an agent that blocks immune recognition of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand or adjuvant may be administered. The present invention also relates to compositions and pharmaceutical formulations including one ore more blocking reagents useful for inhibiting T\nH\n 17 responses and/or for inducing immune tolerance {i.e. Trcg responses).\n\n\n(OI 101 Examples of suitable blocking reagents include, but arc not limited to antibodies that block recognition of apoptotic cells, or agents associated with apoptotic cells, such as, e.g, phosphatidylserine, and antibodies that block recognition of TLR Iigands. Specific inhibitors of TLR signaling include but arc not limited to novel small molecule TLR4 antagonists such as TAK-242 [M. Ii, N. et al (2006) MaI Pharmacol 69: 12881.

(2003) Ciirr Opm Pharmacol; 3:396-4031.\n\n\n(011 IJ Agents that block recognition of apoptotic cells include but are not limited to monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that serve to inhibit phospliatidylscrine-dependcnt phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in vitro. One mAb, Kat 5-18, which is specific to the newly identified phosphatidylserine receptor, the T cell immunoglobulin mucin-4 (Tim-4), can do so in vitro and in viva by specifically blocking spontaneous ingestion of apoptotic cells by macrophages (M. Miyanishi, et al (2007) Nature 450; 435-439]. Other neutralizing antibodies that block recognition of phsophatidylscrinc have also been described \n\n IKobayashi N. et. al. (2007) Immunity, 27: 927-940|. Recognition of phosphatidylserine is likely complex and possibly involves both thrombospondin (TSP) and GASό which might bridge apoptotic cell phosphatidylserine to phagocyte αv integrins and Mer kinase, respectively. Blocking the ability of these molecules to form a bridge between phosphatidylserine and the DC may be an effective means of blocking apoptotic cell recognition. Finally, milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) has also been identified as a bridging molecule between apoptotic cell phosphatidylserine and the DC αyintcgrins, an interaction which may also be blocked to prevent recognition of apoptotic cell exposed phosphatidylserine [Reviewed in Savill and Gregory (2007) Immunity 2007 27:830-832].\n\n\n[0112] In some aspects of the present invention, methods for the treatment of a Tn 17- driven disease or condition arc provided. Diseases or conditions that may benefit from the compositions and methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, colitis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, allergic airway disease, atopic asthma, allergic asthma, Sjogren's Syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n\nVaccine Compositions\n\n\n[01 13] The vaccine compositions of the present invention may be used to induce Tn 17 responses in a patient. Alternatively, the vaccine compositions of the present invention may be used to inhibit Tu 17 responses and. optionally, to induce T\nreg\n cell responses.\n\n\n[0114] In certain embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the present invention preferentially induce Tn 17 responses based on the novel combination of adjuvants which they contain. Specifically, in certain embodiments, the vaccine compositions contain a TLR ligand-containing apoptotic cell or an apoptotic cell-associated agent preferably administered with a TLR Iigand as a single entity or physical form. Conventionally, vaccine compositions contain adjuvants, such as cholera toxin, that stimulate the immune response. Many of the adjuvants that are safe for human use do not elicit effective immune responses, in part because they do not specifically elicit Tiil7-driveH responses in mucosal sites. Most vaccines are delivered to mucosal sites, either via the airways or orally, where \n\n T\nH\nI 7 responses are thought to be preferred. Thus, the present invention provides vaccine compositions which preferentially induce TnJ 7 responses.\n\n\n(0115] For the treatment of certain diseases, preferential induction of T\nH\n 17 responses by a vaccine composition is highly preferred. For example, as discussed, supra, certain cancers, such as epithelial or mixed epithelial carcinomas, are adversely effected by the presence of T\nreg\n cells, which may prevent successful immune responses against the tumor. In this case, the compositions and methods provided by the present invention, which preferentially induce a Tn 17 response, thereby inhibiting the T\nreg\n response, are highly useful for the treatment of certain cancers. Similarly, infections with certain strains of bacteria that cause significant apoptosis and cell death in infected tissues may preferentially benefit from the induction of T\nH\n 17 responses. These may include but are not limited to infections with Pseudomona aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Shigella dysenteriae, and enteropathogenic or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively).\n\n\n1 OI 16J In certain other embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the present invention inhibit T\nH\nI 7 responses. This is achieved by the selective inhibition of T\nH\nI 7 response by blocking recognition of either one or both of the TLR ligand and the apoptotic cell.\n\n\n[Oi l 7J In certain other embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the present invention inhibits THI 7 responses and instead induces T\nreg\n responses. This is achieved by the selective inhibition of the T\nH\n 17 response by blocking the TLR stimulating component of the TLR ligand-containing apoptotic cell adjuvant discovered by the present invention. This results in activity of the apoptotic cell alone (without TLR ligand), a scenario that favors T\nrcg\n responses and thus serves to modulate T\nH\n 17 responses to T\nrcg\n responses.\n\n\n[0118] Vaccine compositions which inhibit T\nR\n17 responses arc highly useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease, colitis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, allergic airway disease, atopic asthma, allergic asthma, Sjogren's Syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Such vaccine compositions provided by the present invention are also highly useful for the treatment of certain cancers, in which it is useful to inhibit THI 7 responses, and to increase the number of T\nreg\n cells. As discussed, supra, such cancers include, but are not limited to, Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy, and T cell lcukcmia/lymphoma. \n\n 101 J 91 In certain embodiments of the invention, compositions and formulations of the invention, including vaccine compositions, contain DC along with the combination of a TLR adjuvant and an apoptotic cell component preferably administered as a single entity or in one physical form. The present invention discloses the surprising finding that loading DC, either during or before transfer to a patient, with the combination of a TLR agonist and an apoptotic cell or apoptotic cell-associated agent (as one entity, e.g., encapsulated in liposomes or physically linked or contained within a carrier), can generate a Tl 7 response in vivo. \"Loading\" of a DC means that the DC is cultured ex vivo or in vitro and pulsed with the cargo with which the DCs is to be \"loaded\". For example, in certain embodiments, the DC is pulsed with a microbe-infected apoptotic cell or an apoptotic cell that previously internalized an inactivated form of a microbe. Upon phagocytosis of the infected apoptotic cell, the DC concurrently recognizes the TLR Iigands associated with the microbe infecting the cell and that the cell is apoptotic (e.g., through receptor-mediated binding of phosphatidylserineX and thus becomes primed to induce a Tn 17 response upon transfer to the recipient (patient). Moreover, if the DC is also loaded with a suitable vaccine antigen, e.g., a tumor-associated antigen, the DC will present peptides of this antigen in the context of surface MHC class Il molecules to CD4 T cells in the patient, thereby inducing an antigen-specific, THI 7-driven immune response.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n[ 0120 ] The following definitions are provided for clarity and illustrative purposes only, and arc not intended to limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\nExpression Construct\n\n\n(0121 J By \"expression construct\" is meant a nucleic acid sequence comprising a target nucleic acid sequence or sequences whose expression is desired, opcratively associated with expression control sequence elements which provide for the proper transcription and translation of the target nucleic acid sequence(s) within the chosen host cells. Such sequence elements may include a promoter and a polyadenylation signal. The \"expression construct\" may further comprise \"vector sequences\". By \"vector sequences\" is meant any of several nucleic acid sequences established in the art which have utility in the recombinant DNA technologies of the invention to facilitate the cloning and propagation of \n\n the expression constructs including (but not limited to) plasmids, cosmids, phage vectors, viral vectors, and yeast artificial chromosomes. j 0122\n*\nj Expression constructs of the present invention may comprise vector sequences that facilitate the cloning and propagation of the expression constructs. A large number of vectors, including plasmid and fungal vectors, have been described for replication and/or expression in a variety of cukaryotic and prokaryotϊc host cells. Standard vectors useful in the current invention arc well known in the art and include (but arc not limited to) plasmids, cosmids, phage vectors, viral vectors, and yeast artificial chromosomes. The vector sequences may contain a replication origin for propagation in Escherichia eoli (E. colf)\\ the SV40 origin of replication; an ampicillin, neomycin, or puromycin resistance gene for selection in host cells; and/or genes (e.g., dihydrofolate reductase gene) that amplify the dominant selectable marker plus the gene of interest.\n\n\nExpress and Expression\n\n\n[0123] The terms \"express\" and \"expression\" mean allowing or causing the information in a gene or DNA sequence to become manifest, for example producing a protein by activating die cellular functions involved in transcription and translation of a corresponding gene or DNA sequence. A DNA sequence is expressed in or by a cell to form an \"expression product\" such as a protein. The expression product itself, e.g., the resulting protein, may also be said to be \"expressed\" by the cell. An expression product can be characterized as intracellular, extracellular or secreted. The term \"intracellular\" means something that is inside a cell. The term \"extracellular\" means something that is outside a cell. A substance is \"secreted\" by a cell if it appears in significant measure outside the cell, from somewhere on or inside the cell.\n\n\nTransfection\n\n\n[0124] The term \"transfection\" means the introduction of a foreign nucleic acid into a cell. The term \"transformation\" means the introduction of a \"foreign\" (i.e. extrinsic or extracellular) gene, DNA or RNA sequence to a cell, so that the host cell will express the introduced gene or sequence to produce a desired substance, typically a protein or enzyme coded by the introduced gene or sequence. The introduced gene or sequence may also be called a \"cloned\" or \"foreign\" gene or sequence, may include regulator)' or control sequences, such as start, stop, promoter, signal, secretion, or other sequences used by a \n\n cells genetic machinery. The gene or sequence may include nonfunctional sequences or sequences with no known function. A host cell that receives and expresses introduced DNA or RNA has been \"transformed\" and is a \"rransformant\" or a \"clone\". The DNA or RNA introduced to a host cell can come from any source, including cells of the same genus or species as the host cell, or cells of a different genus or species. In certain embodiments of the present invention, for example, MFB-F 11 mouse fibroblast cells are stably transfectcd with a reporter plasmid consisting of TGF-β-rcsponsivc Smad-binding elements coupled to a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene (SBE-SEAP).\n\n\nElectroporation\n\n\n[01251 \"Electroporation\", as used herein, is a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of the cell plasma membrane caused by an externally applied electrical field. It is usually used in molecular biology as a way of introducing some substance into a cell, such as loading it with a molecular probe, a drug that can change the cell's function, or a piece of coding DNA.\n\n\nExpression System\n\n\n10126] The term \"expression system\" means a host cell and compatible vector under suitable conditions, e.g. for the expression of a protein coded for by foreign DNA earned by the vector and introduced to the host cell.\n\n\nGene or Structural Gene\n\n\n|G127] The term \"gene\", also called a \"structural gene\" means a DNA sequence that codes for or corresponds to a particular sequence of amino acids which comprise all or part of one or more proteins or enzymes, and may or may not include regulatory DNA sequences, such as promoter sequences, which determine for example the conditions under which the gene is expressed. Some genes, which are not structural genes, may be transcribed from DNA to RNA, but are not translated into an amino acid sequence. Other genes may function as regulators of structural genes or as regulators of DNA transcription.\n\n\n[01281 A coding sequence is \"under the control of or \"operatively associated with\" expression control sequences in a cell when RNA polymerase transcribes the coding \n\n sequence into RNA, particularly mRNA, which is then trans-RNA spliced (if it contains introns) and translated into the protein encoded by the coding sequence.\n\n\n[ 0129\n*\n| The term \"expression control sequence\" refers to a promoter and any enhancer or suppression elements that combine to regulate the transcription of a coding sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the clement is an origin of replication.\n\n\nProteins or Polypeptide\n\n\n1013OT The definitions of protein and polypeptide arc well-known in the art. The term \"protein\", as used herein, is synonymous with the term \"polypeptide\", and is understood to mean a chain of amino acids arranged linearly and joined together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid residues. \n\n\n\n\n\n[0131 J The term \"heterologous\" refers to a combination of elements not naturally occurring. For example, heterologous DNA refers to DMA not naturally located in the cell, or in a chromosomal site of the cell. Preferably, the heterologous DNA includes a gene foreign to the cell. For example, the present invention includes chimeric DNA molecules that comprise a DNA sequence and a heterologous DNA sequence which is not part of the DNA sequence. A heterologous expression regulatory clement is such an element that is operatively associated with a different gene than the one it is operativcly associated with in nature. In the context of the present invention, a gene encoding a protein of interest is heterologous to the vector DNA in which it is inserted for cloning or expression, and it is heterologous to a host cell containing such a vector, in which it is expressed.\n\n\nHomologous\n\n\n10132 J The term \"homologous\" as used in the art commonly refers to the relationship between nucleic acid molecules or proteins that possess a \"common evolutionary origin,\" including nucleic acid molecules or proteins within supcrfamiϋes (c.g., the immunoglobulin supcrfamily) and nucleic acid molecules or proteins from different species (Reeck ct al., Cell 1987; 50: 667). Such nucleic acid molecules or proteins have sequence homology, as reflected by their sequence similarity, whether in terms of substantial percent similarity or the presence of specific residues or motifs at conserved positions. \n\n Host Cell\n\n\nJ0133J The term \"host cell\" means any cell of any organism that is selected, modified, transformed, grown or used or manipulated in any way for the production of a substance by the cell. For example, a host cell may be one that is manipulated to express a particular gene, a DNA or RNA sequence, a protein or an enzyme. Host cells can further be used for screening or other assays that are described infra. Host cells may be cultured in vitro or one or more cells in a non-human animal (e.g., a transgenic animal or a transiently transfected animal). Suitable host cells include but are not limited to Strepiomyces species andii. colL\n\n\nMicrobe or Pathogen\n\n\n[0134] The terms \"microbe\" and \"microorganism\n1\n' arc understood to include, but arc not limited to, bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaca, and protists. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the term \"microbe\" applies to any biological microscopic organism. A pathogen is typically defined as an organism or microbe, such as a bacterium or virus that can invade a host and cause harm to the host. Intracellular and extracellular parasites may also be pathogens. Usually, a pathogen will elicit an immune response in the infected host. Some microbes are not normally pathogenic, such as, e.g., the bacteria that line the gut or the surface of the epithelium (skin), however, even conventionally non-pathogenic bacteria may become pathogenic in certain circumstances, e.g., if they become overpopulated, or if they colonize sites of the body that they normally do not populate. The present invention identifies that bacteria which cause significant apoptosis and tissue damage at epithelial surfaces are most likely best suited to induce Tn 17 immunity. Apoptosis is typically caused by special type III secretion systems that inject bacterial apoptosis effector proteins into the host cell.\n\n\nTreating or Treatment\n\n\n[01351 \"Treating\" or \"treatment\" of a state, disorder or condition includes:\n\n\n[01361 (1 ) Preventing or delaying the appearance of clinical or sub-clinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition developing in a mammal that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the state, disorder or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or subclinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition; or \n\n [01371 (2) Inhibiting the state, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting, reducing or delaying the development of the disease or a relapse thereof (in case of maintenance treatment) or at least one clinical or sub-clinical symptom thereof; or\n\n\n[0138] (3) Relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the state, disorder or condition or at least one of its clinical or sub-clinical symptoms.\n\n\n(01391 The benefit to a subject to be treated is either statistically significant or at least perceptible to the patient or to the physician.\n\n\nPatient or Subject\n\n\n[01401 \"Patient\" or \"subject\" refers to mammals and includes human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\nTherapeutically Effective Amount\n\n\n[0141 J A \"therapeutically effective amount\" means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a state, disorder or condition, is sufficient to effect such treatment. The \"therapeutically effective amount\" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, physical condition and responsiveness of the mammal to be treated.\n\n\nProphylactically Effective Amount\n\n\n[0142J A \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\nAbout or Approximately\n\n\n[ 0 J 431 The term \"about\" or \"approximately\" means within an acceptable range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, e.g., the limitations of the measurement system. For example, \"about\" can mean a range of up to 20 %, preferably up to 10 %, more preferably up to 5 %, and more preferably still up to 1 % of a given value. Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can \n\n mean within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5-fold, and more preferably within 2-fold, of a value. Unless otherwise stated, the term 'about' means within an acceptable error range for the particular value.\n\n\nInclude or Comprise\n\n\n[0144] As used herein, the terms \"include\" and \"comprise\" arc used synonymously. It should be understood that the terms \"a\" and \"an\" as used herein refer to \"one or more\" of the enumerated components. The use of the alternative (eg-, \"or\") should be understood to mean either one, both, or any combination thereof of the alternatives.\n\n\nIsolated\n\n\n101451 As used herein, the term \"isolated\" means that the referenced material is removed from the environment in which it is normally found. Thus, an isolated biological material can be free of cellular components, i.e., components of the cells in which the material is found or produced. Isolated nucleic acid molecules include, for example, a PCR product, an isolated mRNA, a cDNA. or a restriction fragment. Isolated nucleic acid molecules also include, for example, sequences inserted into plasmids, cosmids, artificial chromosomes, and the like. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is preferably excised from the genome in which it may be found, and more preferably is no longer joined to non- regulatory sequences, non-coding sequences, or to other genes located upstream or downstream of the nucleic acid molecule when found within the genome. An isolated protein may be associated with other proteins or nucleic acids, or both, with which it associates in the cell, or with cellular membranes if it is a membrane-associated protein.\n\n\nPurified\n\n\n10146 J The term \"purified\" as used herein refers to material that has been isolated under conditions that reduce or eliminate the presence of unrelated materials, i.e. contaminants, including native materials from which the material is obtained. The isolated material is preferably substantially free of cell or culture components, including tissue culture components, contaminants, and the like. As used herein, the term \"substantially free\" is used operationally, in the context of analytical testing of the material Preferably, purified material substantially free of contaminants is at least 50% pure; more preferably, at least 90% pure, and more preferably still at least 99% pure. Purity can be evaluated by \n\n chromatography, gel electrophoresis, immunoassay, composition analysis, biological assay, and other methods known in the art.\n\n\nMutant\n\n\n[0147J As used herein, the terms ''mutant\" and \"mutation\" refer to any detectable change in genetic material (e.g., DNA) or any process, mechanism, or result of such a change. This includes gεne mutations, in which the structure (e.g., DNA sequence) of a gene is altered, any gene or DNA arising from any mutation process, and any expression product (e.g., protein or enzyme) expressed by a modified gene or DNA sequence. As used herein, the term \"mutating\" refers to a process of creating a mutant or mutation.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Molecule\n\n\n|0148] A \"nucleic acid molecule\" or \"oligonucleotide'\n*\n refers to the phosphate ester polymeric form of ribomicleosides (adenosine, guanosinc, uridine or cytidinc; \"RNA molecules\") or dcoxyribonuclcosides (deoxyadcnoshic, deoxyguanosinc, dcoxythymidine, or dcoxycytidinc; \"DNA molecules\"), or any phosphoester analogs thereof, such as phosphorothioatcs and thioestcrs, in either single stranded form, or a double-stranded helix. Double stranded DNA-DNA. DNA-RNA and RNA-RNA helices arc possible. The term nucleic acid molecule, and in particular DNA or RNA molecule, refers only to the primary and secondary structure of the molecule, and does not limit it to any particular tertiary forms. Thus, this term includes double-stranded DNA found, inter alia, in linear (e.g., restriction fragments) or circular DNA molecules, plasmids, and chromosomes. In discussing the structure of particular double-stranded DNA molecules, sequences may be described herein according to the normal convention of giving only the sequence in the 5' to 3' direction along the non-transcribed strand of DNA {i.e., the strand having a sequence homologous to the niRNA). A \"recombinant DNA molecule\" is a DNA molecule that has undergone a molecular biological manipulation.\n\n\n[0149] The nucleic acid molecules of sequences disclosed herein arc written according to The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) DNA codes. Specifically, \"A\" is Adenine, \"C\" is Cytosinc, \"G\" is Guanine, \"T\" is Thymine, \"U\" is Uracil \"R\" is any Purine (A or G), \"Y\" is any Pyrimidine (C, T, or U), \"M\" is C or A, \"K\" is T, U, or G, \"W\" is T, U, or A, \"S\" is C or G, \"B\" is C, T, U, or G (not A), \"D\" is A, T, U, \n\n or G (not C), \"H\" is A, T, U, or C (not G), \"V\" is A, C, or G (not T, not U), and \"N\" is any base (A, C, G, T, or U).\n\n\nNucleic Acid Hybridization\n\n\n10150] The term \"nucleic acid hybridization\" refers to anti-parallel hydrogen bonding between two single-stranded nucleic acids, in which A pairs with T (or U if an RNA nucleic acid) and C pairs with G. Nucleic acid molecules are \"hybridizable\" to each other when at least one strand of one nucleic acid molecule can form hydrogen bonds with the complementary bases of another nucleic acid molecule under defined stringency conditions. Stringency of hybridization is determined, e.g., by (i) the temperature at which hybridization and/or washing is performed, and (ii) the ionic strength and (iii) concentration of denaturants such as formamidc of the hybridization and washing solutions, as well as other parameters. Hybridization requires that the two strands contain substantially complementary sequences. Depending on the stringency of hybridization, however, some degree of mismatches may be tolerated. Under \"low stringency\" conditions, a greater percentage of mismatches are tolerable (i.e., will not prevent formation of an anti- parallel hybrid). Sec Molecular Biology of the Cell, Alberts et al., 3rd ed., New York and London: Garland Publ, 1994, Ch. 7.\n\n\nf 0151 J Typically, hybridization of two strands at high stringency requires that the sequences exhibit a high degree of complementarity over an extended portion of their length. Examples of high stringency conditions include: hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 0.5 M NaHPO\n4\n, 7 % SDS, 1 mM EDTA at 65\n0\nC, followed by washing in O.lx SSC/0.1 % SDS at 68\n0\nC (where Ix SSC is 0.15M NaCl, 0.15M Na citrate) or for oligonucleotide molecules washing in 6xSSC/0.5 % sodium pyrophosphate at about 37\n0\nC (for 14 nucleotide-long oligos), at about 48\n0\nC (for about 17 nucleotide-long oligos), at abotit 55\n0\nC (for 20 nucleotide-long oligos), and at about 6O\n0\nC (for 23 πucleotide-long oligos)). Accordingly, the term \"high stringency hybridization\" refers to a combination of solvent and temperature where two strands will pair to form a \"hybrid\" helix only if their nucleotide sequences are almost perfectly complementary (sec Molecular Biology of the Cell, Alberts et al., 3rd ed., New York and London: Garland Publ., 1994, Ch. 7).\n\n\n[0152J Conditions of intermediate or moderate stringency (such as, for example, an aqueous solution of 2XSSC at 65°C; alternatively, for example, hybridization to fϊlter- \n\n bound DNA in 0.5 M NaHPCM, 7 % SDS, I mM EDTA at 65\n0\nC, and washing in 0.2 x SSC/OJ % SDS at 42\n0\nC) and low stringency (such as, for example, an aqueous solution of 2XSSC at 55\n0\nC)\n1\n require correspondingly less overall complementarity for hybridization to occur between two sequences. Specific temperature and salt conditions for any given stringency hybridization reaction depend on the concentration of the target DNA and length and base composition of the probe, and arc normally determined empirically in preliminary experiments, which are routine (see Southern. J. MoI. Biol. 1975: 98: 503; Sambrook et aL Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., vol. 2. eh. 9.50, CSH Laboratory Press, 1989; Ausubcl etal. (eds.), 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Bioiogy, Vol. 1, Green Publishing Associates, Inc., and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, at p. 2.10.3).\n\n\n[0153] As used herein, the term \"standard hybridization conditions\" refers to hybridization conditions thai allow hybridization of sequences having at least 75 % sequence identity. According to a specific embodiment, hybridization conditions of higher stringency may be used to allow hybridization of only sequences having at least SO % sequence identity, at least 90 % sequence identity, at least 95 % sequence identity, or at least 99 % sequence identity.\n\n\n[0154J Nucleic acid molecules that \"hybridize\" to any desired nucleic acids of the present invention may be of any length. In one embodiment, such nucleic acid molecules arc at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, and at least 70 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, nucleic acid molecules that hybridize arc of about the same length as the particular desired nucleic acid.\n\n\n[01551 Techniques to isolate and modify specific nucleic acids and proteins are well known to those of skill in the art. In accordance with the present disclosiϊrc there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989 (herein \"Sambrook et aL, 1989\"); DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes 1 and Il (D.N. Glover ed. 1985); Oligonucleotide Synthesis (MJ. Gait cd. 1984); Nucleic Acid Hybridization [B.D. Hamcs & S.J. Higgins cds. (1985)]; Transcription And Translation [B.D. Hames & SJ. Higgins, cds. (1984)J; Animal Cell Culture [R-I- Frcshncy, cd. (1986)]; Immobilized Cells And Enzymes [IRL Press, (1986)]; B. Perbal, A Practical Guide To \n\n Molecular Cloning (1984); Ausύbel, F.M. et at (eds.). Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994. These techniques include site directed mutagenesis employing oligonucleotides with altered nucleotides for generating PCR products with mutations (e.g., the \"Quikchangc\" kit manufactured by Stratagcnc).\n\n\nPrimers\n\n\n101561 The term \"primer,\" as used herein, refers to an oligonucleotide capable of acting as a point of initiation of DNA synthesis under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, i.e., either in the presence of four different nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for extension (e.g., a DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase) in an appropriate buffer and at a suitable temperature. A primer is preferably a single-stranded DNA. The appropriate length of a primer depends on the intended use of the primer but typically ranges from 6 to 50 nucleotides, preferably from 15-35 nucleotides. Short primer molecules generally require cooler temperatures to form sufficiently stable hybrid complexes with the template. A primer need not reflect the exact sequence of the template nucleic acid, but must be sufficiently complementary to hybridize with the template. The design of suitable primers for the amplification of a given target sequence is well known in the art and described in the literature cited herein. As used herein, a \"forward primer\" is understood to mean a primer that is capable of hybridizing to a region of DNA along the 5' (coding) strand of DNA. A \"reverse\" primer is understood to mean a primer that is capable of hybridizing to a region of DNA along the 3' (non-coding) strand of DNA. j 0157J As used herein, a primer is \"specific,\" for a target sequence if, when used in an amplification reaction under sufficiently stringent conditions, the primer hybridizes primarily only to the target nucleic acid. Typically, a primer is specific for a target sequence if the primer-target duplex stability is greater than the stability of a duplex formed between the primer and any other sequence found in the sample. One of skill in the art will recognize that various factors, such as salt conditions as well as base composition of the primer and the location of the mismatches, will affect the specificity of the primer, and that routine experimental confirmation of the primer specificity will be needed in most cases. Hybridization conditions can be chosen under which the primer can form stable duplexes only with a target sequence. Thus, the use of target-specific primers under suitably stringent amplification conditions enables the specific amplification of those target \n\n sequences which contain the target primer binding sites. The use of sequence-specific amplification conditions enables the specific amplification of those target sequences which contain the exactly complementary primer binding sites.\n\n\n[0158] A \"primer set\" or \"primer pair\" refers to a specific combination of a forward primer and a reverse primer. The \"primer set\" or \"primer pair\" may be used in a PCR reaction to generate a specific PCR product or amplicon.\n\n\n10 ] 591 In certain embodiments, the term \"primer'\n\"\n' is also intended to encompass the oligonucleotides used in ligation-mcdiated amplification processes, in which one oligonucleotide is \"extended\" by ligation to a second oligonucleotide which hybridizes at an adjacent position. Thus, the term \"primer extension\", as used herein, refers to both the polymerization of individual nucleoside triphosphates using the primer as a point of initiation of DNA synthesis and to the ligation of two oligonucleotides to form an extended product.\n\n\nOligonucleotide Preparation\n\n\n[ 0160 ] Oligonucleotides can be prepared by any suitable method, including direct chemical synthesis by a method such as the phosphotricstcr method of Narang et al, 1979, Mctli. Enzymol. 68:90-99; the phosphodiester method of Brown et al., 1979, Mcth. Eπzymol. 68: 109-151; the diethylphosphoraraidite method ofBcaiicage ct al., 1981, Tetrahedron Lett. 22: 1859-1862; and the solid support method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066, each incorporated herein by reference. A review of synthesis methods of conjugates of oligonucleotides and modified nucleotides is provided in Goodchild, 1990, Bioconjugate Chemistry 1{3): 165-187. incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nComplementary\n\n\n10161 J As used herein, \"complementary\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule that can form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid molecule by either traditional Watson- Crick base pairing or other non-traditional types of pairing (e.g., Hoogsteεn or reversed Hoogstcen hydrogen bonding) between complementary nucleosides or nucleotides. \n\n Target sequence, region or nucleic acid\n\n\n[0162] The terms \"target, \"target sequence\", \"target region\", and \"target nucleic acid,\" as used herein, arc synonymous and refer to a region or subsequence of a nucleic acid which is to be amplified or detected.\n\n\nAmplification Reaction\n\n\n101631 The tenii \"amplification reaction\" refers to any chemical reaction, including an enzymatic reaction, which results in increased copies of a template nucleic acid sequence or results in transcription of a template nucleic acid. Amplification reactions include reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), including Real Time PCR (see U.S. Pat. Nos.4.683,195 and 4,683,202; PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis ct al., eds, 1990)). Exemplar}' \"amplification reactions conditions\" or \"amplification conditions\" typically comprise either two or three step cycles. Two step cycles have a denaturation step followed by a hybridization/elongation step. Three step cycles comprise a denaturation step followed by a hybridization step followed by a separate elongation step.\n\n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction\n\n\n10164] Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method that allows exponential amplification of short DNA sequences (usually 100 to 600 bases) within a longer double stranded DNA molecule. PCR entails the use of a pair of primers, each about 20 nucleotides in length, that arc complementary to a defined sequence on each of the two strands of the DNA. These primers arc extended by a DNA polymerase so that a copy is made of the designated sequence. After making this copy, the same primers can be used again, not only to make another copy of the input DNA strand but also of the short copy made in the first round of synthesis. This leads to logarithmic amplification. Since it is necessary to raise the temperature to separate the two strands of the double strand DNA in each round of the amplification process, a major step forward was the discovery of a thermo-stable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) that was isolated from Thermus aquaHcus, a bacterium that grows in hot pools; as a result it is not necessary to add new polymerase in every round of amplification. After several (often about 40) rounds of amplification, the PCR product is analyzed on an agarose gel and is abundant enough to be detected with an cthidium bromide stain. \n\n Real-time or Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n\n[0165J In other embodiments, real-time PCR, also called quantitative real time PCR. quantitative PCR (Q-PCR/qPCR), or kinetic polymerase chain reaction, is a laboratory technique based on PCR, which is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted DNA molecule. qPCR enables both detection and quantification (as absolute number of copies or relative amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes) of a specific sequence in a DNA sample. For example, in the embodiments disclosed herein. qPCR may be used to quantify the amount of fungal DNA in a patient sample. The procedure follows the general principle of PCR; its key feature is that the amplified DNA is quantified as it accumulates in the reaction in real time after each amplification cycle. Two common methods of quantification are the use of fluorescent dyes that intercalate with double-stranded DNA. and modified DNA oligonucleotide probes that fluoresce when hybridized with a complementary DNA. The qPCR results may be quantitated using the ΔΔCt method. This method involves calculating a ΔCt between the average target gene Ct and average housekeeping gene Ct for a given target in each treatment group. The ΔΔCt is used to calculate the \"n-fold\" change in gene expression between groups.\n\n\nPolymerase\n\n\n[0166J As used herein, a \"polymerase\" refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides. Generally, the enzyme will initiate synthesis at the 3'-end of the primer annealed to a nucleic acid template sequence. \"DNA polymerase\" catalyzes the polymerization of dcoxyribonucleolidcs. Known DNA polymerases include, for example, Pyrococcihsfuriosiis (Pfu) DNA polymerase (Lundberg ct a!.. 1991 , Gene. 108: 1), E. cυli DNA polymerase I (Lccomtc and Doublcday, 1983, Nucleic Acids Res. 11 :7505). T7 DNA polymerase (Nordstrom et al., 1981, J. Biol. Chem. 256:3112). Thermits thermophilics (Tth) DNA polymerase (Myers and Gelfand 1991, Biochemistry 30:7661), Bacillus stearυthermophilus DNA polymerase (Stenesh and McGowan, 1977, Biochim Biophys Acta 475:32). Thermocacats H (oralis (TIi) DNA polymerase (also referred to as Vent DNA polymerase. Caricllo et al., 1991, Nucleic Acids Res, 19: 4193), Thermotυga maήlima (Tma) DNA polymerase (Diaz and Sabino, 1998 Braz J. Med. Res, 31:1239), Thermits aquations (Taq) DNA polymerase (Chicn ct al, 1976, J. Bacteoriol, 127: 1550), Pyrococciis kodakaraensis KOD DNA polymerase (Takagi ct al., 1997, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63:4504), JDF-3 DNA polymerase (Patent application WO 0132887). and \n\n P)ψococcus GB-D (PGB-D) DNA polymerase (Juncosa-Ginesta et al., 1994, Biotechniques. 16:820). The polymerase activity of any of the above enzymes can be determined by means well known in the art.\n\n\nReaction Mixture\n\n\n[0167J The term \"reaction mixture,\" as used herein, refers to a solution containing reagents necessary to cany out a given reaction. An '\"amplification reaction mixture\", which refers to a solution containing reagents necessary to carry out an amplification reaction, typically contains oligonucleotide primers and a DNA polymerase or ligase in a suitable buffer. A \"PCR reaction mixture\" typically contains oligonucleotide primers, a DNA polymerase (most typically a thermostable DNA polymerase), dNTPs, and a dh'alent metal cation in a suitable buffer. A reaction mixture is referred to as complete if it contains all reagents necessary to enable the reaction, and incomplete if it contains only a subset of the necessary reagents. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that reaction components are routinely stored as separate solutions, each containing a subset of the total components, for reasons of convenience, storage stability, or to allow for application- dependent adjustment of the component concentrations, and that reaction components are combined prior to the reaction to create a complete reaction mixture. Furthermore, it will be understood by one of skill in the art that reaction components are packaged separately for commercialization and that useful commercial kits may contain any subset of the reaction components which includes the blocked primers of the disclosure.\n\n\nLigation and Ligase\n\n\n10168] The term \"ligation\" as used herein refers to the covalent joining of two polynucleotide ends. In various embodiments, ligation involves the covalent joining of a 3' end of a first polynucleotide (the acceptor) to a 5' end of a second polynucleotide (the donor). Ligation results in a phosphodiester bond being formed between the polynucleotide ends. In various embodiments, ligation may be mediated by any enzyme, chemical, or process that results in a covalent joining of the polynucleotide ends. In certain embodiments, ligation is mediated by a ligase enzyme.\n\n\n[ 0169] As used herein, \"ligase\" refers to an enzyme that is capable of covalcntly linking the 3' hydroxyl group of a nucleotide to the 5' phosphate group of a second nucleotide. Examples of ligascs include E. coli DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase, etc. \n\n (01701 The ligation reaction can be employed in DNA amplification methods such as the \"ligase chain reaction\" (LCR), also referred to as the \"ligase amplification reaction\" (LAR), see Barany, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL, 88:189 (1991); and Wu and Wallace, Genomics 4:560 (1989) incorporated herein by reference. In LCR, four oligonucleotides, two adjacent oligonucleotides which uniquely hybridize to one strand of the target DNA, and a complementary set of adjacent oligonucleotides, that hybridize to the opposite strand arc mixed and DNA ligase is added to the mixture. Provided that there is complete complementarity at the junction, ligase will covalently link each set of hybridized molecules. Importantly, in LCR, two probes arc ligatcd together only when they base-pair with sequences in the target sample, without gaps or mismatches. Repeated cycles of dcnaturation, hybridization and ligation amplify a short segment of DNA. LCR has also been used in combination with PCR to achieve enhanced detection of single-base changes, sec Segcv, PCT Public. No. WO9001069 Al (1990).\n\n\nOrthologs\n\n\nJOlTl] As used herein, the term \"orthologs\" refers to genes in different species that apparently evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Normally, orthologs retain the same function through the course of evolution. Identification of orthologs can provide reliable prediction of gene function in newly scqucnced genomes. Sequence comparison algorithms that can be used to identify orthologs include without limitation BLAST, FASTA. DNA Stridor, and the GCG pilcup program. Orthologs often have high sequence similarity. The present invention encompasses all orthologs of the desired protein.\n\n\nOperatively Associated\n\n\n101721 By \"operatively associated with\" is meant that a target nucleic acid sequence and one or more expression control sequences (e.g., promoters) arc physically linked so as to permit expression of the polypeptide encoded by the target nucleic acid sequence within a host cell.\n\n\nPercent Sequence Similarity or Percent Sequence Identity\n\n\n[01731 The terms \"percent (%) sequence similarity\", \"percent (%)\n\"\nsequencc identity\", and the like, generally refer to the degree of identity or correspondence between different nucleotide sequences of nucleic acid molecules or amino acid sequences of proteins that \n\n may or may not share a common evolutionary origin (see Reeck et al., supra). Sequence identity can be determined using any of a number of publicly available sequence comparison algorithms, such as BLAST, FASTA, DNA Stridor, GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Program Manual for the GCG Package, Version 7, Madison, Wisconsin), etc.\n\n\n[0174] To determine the percent identity between two amino acid sequences or two nucleic acid molecules, the sequences arc aligned for optimal comparison purposes. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., percent identity = number of identical positions/total number of positions (e.g., overlapping positions) x 100). In one embodiment, the two sequences are, or are about, of the same length. The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described below, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent sequence identity, typically exact matches arc counted.\n\n\n[0175] The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 87:2264, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1993, 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., J. MoL Biol. 1990; 215: 403. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength = 12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to sequences of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to protein sequences of die invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul ct al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997, 25:3389. Alternatively, PSI-Blast can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationship between molecules. See Altschul ct al. (1997) supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. Sec ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ on the WorldWideWeb. Another non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm ofMyers and Miller, CABIOS 1988; 4: 11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into die ALIGN program (version 2.0), which is part of the GCG sequence \n\n alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.\n\n\n[0176] In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the algorithm of Needlcnian and Wunsch (J. MoI. Biol. 1970, 48:444-453). which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (Accclrys, Burlington, MA; available at acccli-ys.com on the WorldWidcWeb), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, a gap weight of 16. 14, 12, 10. 8, 6, or 4, and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix, a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80, and a length weight of 1 , 2.3, 4, 5, or 6. A particularly preferred set of parameters (and the one that can be used if the practitioner is uncertain about what parameters should be applied to determine if a molecule is a sequence identity or homology limitation of the invention) is using a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap open penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. fO 177] In addition to the cDNA sequences encoding various desired proteins, the present invention further provides polynucleotide molecules comprising nucleotide sequences having certain percentage sequence identities to any of the aforementioned sequences. Such sequences preferably hybridize under conditions of moderate or high stringency as described above, and may include species orthologs.\n\n\nVariant\n\n\n[0178 J The term \"variant\" may also be used to indicate a modified or altered gene. DNA sequence, enzyme, cell, etc., i.e., any kind of mutant.\n\n\nImmune Response\n\n\n[0179] An \"immune response\" refers to the development in the host of a cellular and/or antibody-mediated immune response to a composition or vaccine of interest. Such a response usually consists of the subject producing antibodies, B cells, helper T cells, and/or cytotoxic T cells directed specifically to an antigen or antigens included in the composition or vaccine of interest. The immune response also may include regulatory T-cells, whose \n\n activity may suppress other immune or allergic responses. In certain embodiments, \"immune response\" or \"innate immune response\n\"\n\" may also refer to the initial response of immune cells to the presence of microbial organism or to the presence of \"pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)\", which arc evolutionarily conserved amino acid or πucleic acid sequences recognized by pattern recognition receptors on immune cells. This initial response is characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other pro- immune mediators by the detecting immune cells and is usually necessary for the induction of the cellular and/or antibody-mediated \"adaptive\" immune responses discussed above. TLR ligands expressed by E. coli and Citrobacler rodentium include but are not limited to LPS (TLR4 ligand), PGN (TLR2 ligand), triacyl lipopetides (TLR2 ligand), lipoproteins (TLR2 ligand), unmethylated DNA (TLR9 ligand), and single stranded RNA (TLR7 and TLR8). Other preferred microbes for the present invention include bacterial strains selected for use as live attenuated vaccines. Examples of these include but arc not limited to Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine against tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi Ty21a vaccine against typhoid fever, and Vibrio cholerae CVD 103-HgR vaccine against cholera. These microorganisms may additionally express the TLR5 ligand Flagelϊin in addition to the PAMPs shared by E. coli and Citrobacler rodentium.\n\n\nAntigen and Imraunogen\n\n\n101801 An \"antigen\" (from antibody-generating) or \"immunogen\" is a substance that prompts the generation of antibodies and can cause an immune response. For example, in the present invention, proteins associated with tumors may be used as antigens or immunogens to stimulate an immune response against a tumor. An \"immunodominant antigen\" is defined as an antigen for which a higher relative number of T cells will be specific during an immune response, compared to the numbers of T cells with T cell receptors that recognize other antigens.\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n[0181] Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins (Ig)) arc gamma globulin proteins that are found in blood or other bodily fluids of vertebrates, and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses. They are typically made of basic structural units — each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains — to form, for example, monomers with one unit, dimers with two units or \n\n pentamers with five units. Antibodies are produced by B cells. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypcs based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypcs arc known, in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.\n\n\n101821 Although the genera! structure of all antibodies is very similar, a smal 1 region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with, slightly different rip structures to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different target, known as an antigen. This huge diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide diversity of antigens. The unique part of the antigen recognized by an antibody is termed an \"epitope.\" These epitopes bind with their antibody in a highly specific interaction, called induced fit, which allows antibodies to identify and bind only their unique antigen in the midst of the millions of different molecules that make up an organism. Recognition of an antigen by an antibody tags it for attack by other parts of the immune system. Antibodies can also neutralize targets directly by, for example, binding to a part of a pathogen that it needs to cause an infection. Production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELiSA)\n\n\n[0183] Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, also called ELISA, Enzyme lmmunoAssay or EIA, is a biochemical technique used to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. In ELISA, an unknown amount of antigen is affixed to a surface, and then a specific antibody is washed over the surface so that it can bind to the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step a substance is added that the enzyme can convert to some detectable signal. Thus in the case of fluorescence ELISA, when light of the appropriate wavelength is shone upon the sample, any antigen/antibody complexes will fluoresce so that the amount of antigen in the sample can be inferred through the magnitude of the fluorescence. Performing an ELlSA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a polystyrene microliter plate) either non-spccifically (via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a \"sandwich\" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The \n\n detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme, or can itself be detected by a secondary antibody which is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation. Between each step the plate is typically washed with a mild detergent solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that arc not specifically bound. After the final wash step the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample. Older ELISAs utilize chromogenic substrates, though newer assays employ fluorogenic substrates enabling much higher sensitivity.\n\n\nTransgenic Mouse\n\n\n[G 1841 A transgenic mouse contains additional, artificially-introduced genetic material in every cell. This often confers a gain of function, for example the mouse may produce a new protein, but a loss of function may occur if the integrated DNA interrupts another gene. A transgenic mouse is a very useful system for studying mammalian gene function and regulation because analysis is carried out on the whole organism. Transgenic mice are also used to model human diseases that involve the overexpression or misexpression of a particular protein. There arc two major methods. Methods for making transgenic mice include \"promiclear microinjection\", in which the foreign DNA is introduced directly into the mouse egg just after fertilization. Using a fine needle, the DNA is injected into the large male pronucleus, which is derived from the sperm. The DNA tends to integrate as many tandcmly arranged copies at a random position in the genome, often after one or two cell divisions have occurred. Therefore, the resulting mouse is only partially transgenic. If the transgenic cells contribute to the germ line, then some transgenic eggs or sperm will be produced and the next generation of mice will be fully transgenic. In another method, DNA is introduced into embryonic stem cells (ES cells). These are derived from the very early mouse embryo and can therefore differentiate into all types of cell when introduced into another embryo. DNA introduced into ES cells may integrate randomly, as in the case of promiclear microinjection. However, if the introduced DNA is similar in sequence to part of the mouse genome, it may undergo \"homologous recombination\" and integrate as a single copy at a specific site. ES cells will colonize a host embryo and often contribute to the germ line, resulting in the production of some sperm carrying die extra DNA. When these transgenic sperm fertilize a normal egg, a transgenic mouse is produced with the same foreign DNA in every cell. \n\n Knockout Mouse\n\n\n[0185] A knockout mouse is a laboratory mouse in which researchers have inactivated, or \"knocked out,\" an existing gene by replacing it or disrupting it with an artificial piece of DNA. The loss of gene activity often causes changes in a mouse's phcnotypc, which includes appearance, behavior and other observable physical and biochemical characteristics. Researchers begin by harvesting embryonic stem (ES) cells from carly- stagc mouse embryos four days after fertilization. ES cells arc used because they arc able to differentiate into nearly any type of adult cell, which means that if a gene is knocked out in an ES cell, flic effects can be observed in any tissue in an adult mouse. In addition, ES cells grown in the lab can be used to make knockout mice as long as 10 years after they were harvested. To produce knockout mice, researchers use one of two methods to insert artificial DNA into the chromosomes contained in the nuclei of ES cells. Both methods arc carried out in vitro that is in cultured cells grown in laboratory conditions. In the first strategy, called gene targeting or homologous recombination researchers specifically manipulate a gene in the nucleus of an ES cell. Typically, this is done by introducing an artificial piece of DNA that shares identical, or homologous, sequence to the gene. This homologous sequence flanks the existing gene's DNA sequence both upstream and downstream of the gene's location on the chromosome. The cell's own nuclear machinery automatically recognizes the identical stretches of sequence and swaps out the existing gene or portion of a gene with the artificial piece of DNA. Because the artificial DNA is inactive, bearing only a genetic tag, or \"reporter gene,\" designed for use in tracking, the swap eliminates, or \"knocks out,\" the function of the existing gene.\n\n\n[01861 In the second strategy, called gene trapping, researchers again manipulate a gene in an ES cell. However, instead of directly targeting a gene of interest, a random process is used. A piece of artificial DNA containing a reporter gene is designed to insert randomly into any gene. The inserted piece of artificial DNA prevents the cell's RNA \"splicing\" machinery from working properly, thus preventing the existing gene from producing its designated protein and knocking out its function. As in the first strategy, researchers can track the activity of the artificial reporter gene to determine the existing gene's normal pattern of activity in mouse tissues. For both gene targeting and gene trapping, the vehicle used to ferry the artificial DNA into ES cells often consists of a modified viral vector or a linear fragment of bacterial DNA. After the artificial DNA is \n\n inserted, the genetically altered ES cells are grown in a lab dish for several days and injected into early-stage mouse embryos. The embryos are implanted into the uterus of a female mouse and allowed to develop into mouse pups. The resulting mouse pups have some tissues in which a gene has been knocked out - those derived from the altered ES cells. However, they also have some normal tissues derived from the non-altered embryos into which the altered ES cells were injected. Consequently, they are not complete knockout mice. It is necessary to crossbreed such mice to produce ϋnes of mice in which both copies of the gene (one on each chromosome) arc knocked out in all tissues. These mice are referred to as homozygous knockouts. f()187| In certain embodiments, \"double knockout\" mice are used. Double knockout mice have two genes that have been deleted, as described above. Examples of knockout mice of the present invention include TLR 4 knockout mice (TLR4\n\"\"\n), ΪL6\n\"\n'\\ and MyD88\n\" \"\n /TRIF\n\"\"\n double knockout mice.\n\n\nPharmaceutically Acceptable\n\n\n[0188] When formulated in a pharmaceutical composition, a therapeutic compound of the present invention can be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. As used herein, the phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" refers to molecular entities and compositions that are generally believed to be physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, dizziness and the like, when administered to a human.\n\n\nPharmaceutically Acceptable Derivative\n\n\n[0189] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable derivative\" as used herein means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug, e.g. ester, of a compound of the invention, which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of the invention, or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Such derivatives are recognizable to those skilled in the art, without undue experimentation. Nevertheless, reference is made to die teaching of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, VoI 1 : Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent of teaching such derivatives. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives arc salts, solvates, esters, carbamates, and phosphate esters. Particularly \n\n preferred pharmaceutical Ij' acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates, and esters. Most preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts and esters.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Administration\n\n\n[01901 While it is possible to use a composition provided by the present invention for therapy as is, it may be preferable to administer it in a pharmaceutical formulation, e.g., in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, diluent, or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition or formulation comprising at least one active composition, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, and/or carrier. The excipient. diluent and/or carrier must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n[0191 ] The compositions of the invention can be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Carrier\n\n\n101921 The term \"carrier\" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient. or vehicle with which the compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Alternatively, the carrier can be a solid dosage form carrier, including but not limited to one or more of a binder (for compressed pills), a glidant. an encapsulating agent, a flavorant, and a colorant. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\" by E.W. Martin (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042).\n\n\n[ 0193 ] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is conveniently administered as a liquid oral formulation. Although there are no physical limitations to delivery of the formulation, oral delivery is preferred because of its ease and convenience, and because oral formulations readily accommodate additional mixtures, such as milk, yogurt, and infant formula. Other oral dosage forms are well known in the art and include \n\n tablets, caplets, gelcaps, capsules, and medical foods. Tablets, for example, can be made by well-known compression techniques using wet, dry, or fluidized bed granulation methods.\n\n\n[0194] Such oral formulations may be presented for use in a conventional manner with the aid of one or more suitable excipients, diluents, and carriers. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients assist or make possible the formation of a dosage form for a bioactivc material and include diluents, binding agents, lubricants, glidants, disintcgrants, coloring agents, and other ingredients. Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used. An excipient is pharmaceutically acceptable if, in addition to performing its desired function, it is non-toxic, well tolerated upon ingestion, and does not interfere with absorption of bioactive materials.\n\n\n[0195] Acceptable excipients, diluents, and carriers for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (A.R. Gennaro edit. 2005). The choice of pharmaceutical excipient, diluent, and carrier can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n[0196] The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines. The pharmaceutical compositions and vaccine compositions of the invention include at least one of the compositions of the invention, a suitable antigen (for vaccines), and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Methods of formulating pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, as described in Remington's, supra.\n\n\nFormulations\n\n\n[0197] The compositions, vaccines and formulations of the present invention may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Twccn 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants {e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfϊte), preservatives {e.g., Thimersσl, benzyl alcohol) and bulking \n\n substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol); incorporation of the materia) into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid. etc. or into liposomes. Hylauromc acid may also be used. Sec, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 1 R042) pages 1435 L712 which arc herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n10198 J Contemplated for use herein are oral solid dosage forms, which arc described generally in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. 1990 (Mack Publishing Co. Eastern PA 18042) at Chapter 89, which is herein incorporated by reference. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches or lozenges, cachets, pellets, powders, or granules. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be used to formulate the present compositions (as. for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in U.S. Patent No. 4.925,673). Liposomal encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be dcrivatiκed with various polymers (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556). A description of possible solid dosage forms for the therapeutic is given by Marshall, K. In: Modem Pharmaceutics Edited by G. S. Banker and CT. Rhodes Chapter 10, 1979, herein incorporated by reference. In general, the formulation will include the therapeutic agent and inert ingredients which allow for protection against the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material in the intestine.\n\n\n10199 J Also contemplated for use herein are liquid dosage forms for oral administration, including pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, and syrups, which may contain other components including inert diluents; adjuvants, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents; and sweetening, flavoring, coloring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\n10200] For oral formulations, the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejuncm, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine, e.g., by the use of an enteric coating. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that arc used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcelliilosc phthaiate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthaiate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthaiate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S, and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films. \n\n [0201 ] A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic (i.e. powder), for liquid forms a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing techniques can be used. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs, or even as tablets. These therapeutics could be prepared by compression.\n\n\n[02021 One may dilute or increase the volume of the therapeutic agent with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Aviccll.\n\n\n[0203] Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic agent into a solid dosage form. Materials used as disintegrates include but arc not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlitc, sodium carboxymcthylcclluiosc, ultramylopcctin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and bcntonitc may all be used. The disintegrants may also be insoluble cationie exchange resins. Powdered gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders, and can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants. Binders may be used to hold die therapeutic agent together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidonc (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the peptide (or derivative).\n\n\n10204] An antifrictional agent may be included in the formulation to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the peptide (or derivative) and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylcnc (PTFE), liquid paraffin, \n\n vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants ma)' also be used such as sodium latiryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000.\n\n\n[0205] Glidants that might improve the flow properties drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogcnic silica and hydratcd silicoalumϊnatc.\n\n\n[02061 To aid dissolution of the therapeutic agent into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium laury] sulfate, dioctyl sodium suifosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include benzalkonium chloride or benzcthomium chloride. The list of potential nonionic detergents that could be included in the formulation as surfactants arc iauromacrogol 400, poJyσxyl 40 stearatc, polyoxycthylenc hydrogcnatcd castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostcaratc, polysorbatc 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of the protein or derivative either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.\n\n\n10207J Controlled release oral formulations may used in practicing the present invention. The therapeutic agent could be incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, e.g., gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incoiporated into the formulation. Some enteric coatings also have a delayed release effect. Another form of a controlled release is by a method based on the Oros therapeutic system (Alza Corp.). i.e. the therapeutic agent is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water to enter and push agent out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects.\n\n\n102081 Other coatings may be used for the formulation. These include a variety of sugars which could be applied in a coating pan. The therapeutic agent could also be given in a film coated tablet and the materials used in this instance arc divided into 2 groups. The first arc the noncntcric materials and include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxycthyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methy] cellulose, sodium carboxy-mcthyl cellulose, providonc and the polyethylene glycols. The second group consists of the enteric materials that arc \n\n commonly esters of phthalic acid. A mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating may be carried out in a pan coater or in a flαidized bed or by compression coatmg.\n\n\n[0209] Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or cmuisions. Examples of nonaqueous solvents or vehicles arc propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl olcatc. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants, preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.\n\n\nVaccines\n\n\n[0210] In the case of vaccines, it is often observed that a primary challenge with an antigen alone, in the absence of an adjuvant, will fail to elicit a humoral or cellular immune response. Therefore the vaccines of the invention may contain adjuvants including, but not limited to, cholera toxin, fragments and mutants or derivatives with adjuvant properties, E. coti heat-labile enteratoxin. fragments and mutants or derivatives with adjuvant properties, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, toll-like receptor ligands such as muramyl dipcptide, E. coh LPS, oligonucleotides comprised of unmethylated DNA, poly I:C, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan. Enterotoxins and their adjuvant active derivatives such as cholera toxin, heat-labile E. eoli cnterotoxin, pertussis toxin, shiga toxin and analogs. Other adjuvants can be used such as complete Freund's adjuvant, incomplete Freund's adjuvant, saponin, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, phironic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil or hydrocarbon emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as N-acctyl- muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutaminc (thr-MDP), N-acctyl-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamine, N-acety lmurarøyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-( 1 '~2'-dipalmitoyl- sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryIoxy)-e&ylaminc, BCG {bacille Calmette-Gucrin) and Corynebacterium parvum. An adjuvant can serve as a tissue depot that slowly releases the antigen and also as a lymphoid system activator that non-specifically enhances the immune \n\n response (Hoocl et al, Immunology, Second EcL. 1984, Benjamiπ/Cummings: Menlo Park, California, p. 384). Where the vaccine is intended for use in human subjects, the adjuvant should be pharmaceutically acceptable.\n\n\nVaccine Administration\n\n\n(021 1 [ The pharmaceutical formulations and vaccines ma}' be for administration by oral (solid or liquid), parenteral (intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous injection), transdermal (either passively or using ionophoresis or electroporation), transmucosal (nasal, vaginal, rectal, or sublingual), or inhalation routes of administration, or using bioerodiblc inserts and can be formulated in dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n[0212] In a preferred embodiment, the compositions or vaccines are administered by pulmonary deliver}'. The composition or vaccine is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream [sec, eg.. Adjei, et al. Pharmaceutical Research 1990; 7:565 569; Adjei, ct al. Int. J. Pharmaceutics 1990; 63: 135 144 (lcuprolidc acetate); Braquet, et al. J. Cardiovascular Pharmacology ]989;13(sup5):143 146 (endothelin- 1 ); Hubbard, et al. (1989) Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. Ill, pp. 206212 (αl antitrypsin); Smith, ct al. J. Clin. Invest. 1989;84;1 145-1146 (α 1- protcinasc); Osvvein, et al. \"Acrosolization of Proteins\", 1990; Proceedings of Symposium on Respirator}' Drug Delivery II Keystone, Colorado (recombinant human growth hormone); Debs, ct al. J. Immunol 1988; 140:3482 3488 (interferon γ and tumor necrosis factor α); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,656 to Platz, ct al. (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for pulmonary delivery of drags for s}'stcmic effect is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,569 to Wong, et al. See also U.S. 6,651,655 to Licalsi et al.\n\n\n[ 0213 j Contemplated for use in the practice of diis invention arc a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, mctcrcd dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which arc familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultraveπt nebulizer (Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, MO): die Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Englcwood, CO); the Ventolin metered dose inhaler (Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC); and the \n\n Spinhaler powder inhaler (Fisons Corp., Bedford, MA). All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of the therapeutic agent. Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propcllant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants, surfactants and/or carriers useful in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers is contemplated.\n\n\n102141 Formulations for use with a mctered dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing the therapeutic agent suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propcllant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofiuorocarbon. or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethanc, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1 , 1 , 1 ,2 tetrafluorocthanc, or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant.\n\n\n[0215] Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing the therapeutic agent, and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to 90% by weight of the formulation. The therapeutic agent should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5 mm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.\n\n\n10216] Nasal or other mucosal delivery of the therapeutic agent is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage to the blood stream directly after administering the composition to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dcxtran or cyclodexfran and saponin as an adjuvant.\n\n\n[ 0217] The composition or vaccine of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with one or more additional active ingredients, pharmaceutical compositions, or vaccines. The therapeutic agents of the present invention may be administered to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human. \n\n Dosage\n\n\n10218] The dosage of the therapeutic formulation or vaccine of the present invention will vary widely, depending upon the nature of the disease, the patient's medical history, the frequency of administration, the manner of administration, the clearance of the agent from the host, and the like. The initial dose may be larger, followed by smaller maintenance doses. The dose may be administered as infrequently as weekly or biweekly, or fractionated into smaller doses and administered daily, semi-wccHy, etc., to maintain an effective dosage level.\n\n\n[02191 Following methodologies which arc well-established in the art, effective doses and toxicity of the compounds, vaccines and compositions of the instant invention, which performed well in in vitro tests, arc then determined in preclinical studies using small animal models (e.g., mice or rats) in which the tumor-associated antigens, dendπtic cells, polypeptides, apoptotic cells, TLR adjuvants or agonists, apoptotic cell-associated agents, pharmaceutical, or vaccine compositions have been found to be therapeutically effective and in which these drugs can be administered by the same route proposed for the human clinical trials.\n\n\n[0220J For any pharmaceutical composition or vaccine used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from animal models. Dose-response curves derived from animal systems are then used to determine testing doses for the initial clinical studies in humans. In safety determinations for each composition, the dose and frequency of administration should meet or exceed those anticipated for use in the clinical trial.\n\n\n10221 1 As disclosed herein, the dose of the components in the compositions, vaccines and formulations of the present invention is determined to ensure that the dose administered continuously or intermittently will not exceed an amount determined after consideration of the results in test animals and the individual conditions of a patient. A specific dose naturally varies depending on the dosage procedure, the conditions of a patient or a subject animal such as age. body weight sex, sensitivity, feed, dosage period, drugs used in combination, and seriousness of the disease. The appropriate dose and dosage times under certain conditions can be determined by the test based on the above- described indices but may be refined and ultimately decided according to the judgment of \n\n the practitioner and each patient's circumstances (age, general condition, severity of symptoms, sex, etc.) according to standard clinical techniques. DC are loaded with apoptotic cells or TLR-ligand carrying apoptotic cells or apoptotic cells carrying inactivated microbes at a ratio of 1 DC to 2 apoptotic cells. DC vaccines will be administered every 28 to 30 days at 1-12x10\n6\n DCs/vaccination. As a safety measure, vaccination may be initialized at 1x10\nΛ\n DC/vaccination for the first 4 vaccines. If no toxicity is observed, after completion of 4 vaccinations, doses may be increased to 4x10\n6\n DC, and finally to a maximum of 12x10\n6\n DC/vaccine. These are suggested guidelines based on DC vaccinations of patients with metastatic melanoma in the study by Palucka et al. (2006) J Immunother; 29:545-57. Actual dosage and composition or pharmaceutical formulations of TLR Iigands in combination with apoptotic ccll-sssociated agents may be determined in prc-clinical and clinical trials by standard practices known in the art.\n\n\n[0222] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compositions, vaccines, and formulations of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 {the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio ED50/LD50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices arc preferred.\n\n\n[02231 The data obtained from animal studies can be used in formulating a range of doses for use in humans. The therapeutically effective doses of in humans lay preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Ideally, a single dose of each drug should be used daily.\n\n\nKits\n\n\n[0224] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a kit comprising any one of the compositions or formulations of the present invention. The compositions or formulations included in the kit may be useful for inducing Tn 17 responses, or for inhibiting T\nH\n17 responses, or for inducing T,\ne?\n responses.

Scmi-adhcrent cells were harvested on ice on day 5 and rc-plated immediately in fresh GM-CSF medium at 1x10\nf>\n cells/well in 24-well tissue culture-treated plates. Soluble or phagocytic stimuli were added right away to the plates in the same medium and the cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm. Supcrnatants (conditioned medium, CM) were collected after 18 hours. LPS (fromi;\n'\n. cυli, serotype 055 :B5, L-2880) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. BMDC were treated with various doses of soluble LPS or 2:1 A20 LPS blasts:DC to titrate the LPS such that levels of IL-6 produced by DC in response to these stimuli was similar. Soluble LPS was used at a final concentration of 1 ng/niL. The A20 B-cell line was obtained from the ATCC (TIB- 208). A20 LPS blasts were prepared by culturing A20 cells at IxIO\n6\n ceils/mL, 3 rnL/weH in 6- well tissue culture plates for four days in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, with 100 μg/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutaminc, 10 mM HEPES, 1 nM sodium pyruvate, plus 25 μg/mL LPS, as previously described in Blander, J. M. and Medzhitov, R. (2004) Science 304(5673): 1014. Apoptosis of A20 cells and A20 LPS blasts was induced by culturing cells with 0.5 μg/mL anti-CD95 (clone Jo2; BD) for four hours. Necrotic A20 cells were prepared by submitting cells (rcsuspendcd at 2x10\n6\n cclls/mL in PBS) to two cycles of freezing/thawing by successive incubations in dry ice/ethanol and water at 37°C. Neutrophils and neutrophfls/£. coli were prepared as follows: C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoncally with cither 1 mL thioglycollatc \n\n (Fisher) or J niLthioglycollate spiked with K)\n5\n live DH5 E. coli (Escherichia coir K 12, ATCC 23716). After 14 hours, the mice were sacrificed and cells were collected from a peritoneal wash of the contents of the abdominal cavity. Cells were ccntrifugcd, counted, and apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation at 350 mJ. After irradiation, neutrophils were incubated for four hours at 37\n0\nC before use as phagocytic cargo for DC. Apoptosis of A20 B-ccJls and neutrophils were confirmed by staining cells with cell death Anncxin-V-PE detection kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and observing a majority of Anncxin-V /7AAD cells after four hours. Apoptotic cells were added to BMDC at a ratio of 2: 1.\n\n\nIn vitro T-cell differentiation\n\n\n10230 J Naϊvc CD4 T cells were isolated first by sorting with MACS® CD4\n\"\n beads (Miltcnyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions and then by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a MoFlo™.

Cells were grown in complete IMDM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS, K)U μg/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutaminc, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 nM sodium pyruvate, and activated on 48-well tissue-culture plates which had been coated with 4 μg anti-CD3 (clone 2Cl 1 ) for 3 h at 37\n0\nC, then washed 3 times with PBS. Cultures were supplemented with 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 (clone 37-51, a kind gift from J. Allison, Sloan-Kcttcring Cancer Center) and aπti-IL-4 ascites (clone 1 1 Bl 1, a kind gift from T. Moran, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, ATCC number HB 188) at 1 :500. mAbs 2Cl 1 and 37-51 were purified from hybridoma superπatants by BioXCell Company (West Lebanon, NH). When cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from BMDC, T cells were grown in 1:1 CMifresh complete IMDM. Cytokines and neutralizing antibodies were added at the following concentrations where indicated: IL-6 (Peprotcch, Rocky Hill, NJ) 50 ng/mL; TGF-β (Pcprotech) 5 ng/mL: IL- 12 (eBiosciεnce™) 10 ng/mL; IL-23 (cBiosciencc™) 10 ng/mL; anti-IFN-γ (clone XMG 1.2, a kind gift from T.

Colons of mice of either strain that had been infected with C. rodentmm wiϊd-type or mutant strains showed inflammation grossly, with thickening of the intestinal walls and development of Pcyer's patch-like tertiary lymphoid structures. To prepare IEL/LPL, small intestines and colons were flushed with HBSS medium without calcium or magnesium (Gibco). Intestines were cut longitudinally and washed twice briefly in HBSS, 2% FBS in 6-well plates and then placed in 15 mL ice-cold HBSS, 2% FBS in 50-mL conical tubes and vortexcd at maximum setting for 15-20 seconds. Tissue was removed using long forceps into a new tube with 15 mL ice-cold HBSS, 2% FBS and vortexed again twice, for a total of three washes. The tissues were then placed in 50-mL conical tubes containing 25 mL HBSS, 5% FBS, and I mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich). Tubes were incubated on a rocker at 37\n0\nC for 20 minutes followed by vortexing extensively at maximum setting. For IEL, fractions were collected after two rounds of 20 minutes in HBSS/FBS/DTT. Tissues were then placed in -fresh tubes containing 25 mL of PBS with 1.3 mM EDTA, incubated on a rocker for 60 minutes at 37\n0\nC and vortexed. Tissues were then rinsed twice in RPMl, 2% FBS in 14 6-well plates, placed in new 6-well dishes with 5 mL (colons) or 7 mL (small intestines) of RPMI, 5% FBS, 1.6 mg/mL collagcnase D (Roche), and cut into small pieces. Tissues were then incubated for one hour at 37\n0\nC before homogcnization using a 20 gauge syringe and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD) into a 50-mL conical tube. Wells and strainers were washed with RPMI, 5% FBS to reduce cell loss. Tubes were centrifuged to collect die cell pellet and cells were washed again in RPMI + 5% FBS. Cell pellets were then rcsuspcnded in 8 mL 44% iso-osmotlc Percoll™ (OE Healthcare) in RPMΪ and transferred to FBS-coated 15 mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes. 5 mL of 66% iso-osmotic Percoll™/RPMI was carefully layered underneath the cell layer using Pasteur pipets. Tubes were then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 2800 rpm, 4\n0\nC, with brakes in the lowest setting. After the spin, interface cells were collected using a plastic collection pipet, placed in 15-mL conical tubes, and washed twice with RPML 5% FBS. To rcstimulatc the cells for measuring intracellular cytokine production, cells were then resuspended in complete IMDM with 0.1 μg/mL Phorbol 12- myristatc 13-acctatc (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 μg/mL ionomycin calcium salt, from Streptomyees conglobatus (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 μg/mL Brefeldin A, from \n\n Eiipemcillhim brφldanhtm (Sigma- Aldrich), and cultured for four hours at 37\n0\nC before intracellular cytokine staining.\n\n\nPreparation of tissues and imnninostaining\n\n\n10232 j Colons of C3H/HcOuJ mice were harvested on day 6 and flushed with PBS. Tissues were fresh-frozen in O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finctek, Zoetcrwoudc. The Netherlands) and stored at -8O\n0\nC. Sections of 6 μra were cut and fixed with either 4% paraformaldehyde or ice-cold acetone for 1 h. dried, and stored at -2O\n0\nC. TLJNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR Red (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. For immuuostaining, sections were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies in a humidified atmosphere for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 35 minutes. The slides were then washed and mounrcd with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Tissues were stained with Alcxa Fluor© 594-coπjugated Phalloidin (Invitrogcn, Carlsbad, CA), and E. coli O antigen, polyvalent 8, 0152 (Denka Sciken, Accurate Chemical US distributers, Westbury. NY) [Mundy, R. ct al. (2204) Infect Immun 72 (4), 22881 followed by secondary Alcxa Fluor® 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Analyses were performed using K)X and 2OX dry objectives on a Nikon Eclipse E-600 fluorescence microscope and AdobcOC Photoshop® software (Adobe Systems. San Jose, CA).\n\n\nCitrohacler roάentium inoculation\n\n\nJ0233J Wild-type (WT) C. rodenthim as well as two mutants of C. rodenthim, one with a mutation in EPEC-secreted protein F (ΔEspF) [McNamara, B.

WT, ΔEspF, and ΔMap mutant C. rodenthim strains exhibit similar attachment to and effacement of a colonic cell line [Crane, J. K., et al. (2001) Cell Microbiol 3 (4): 197; McNamara, B. P. etal. (2001) j Clin Invest 107 (5):621 J, and all three strains colonize the intestinal epithelium to similar levels as shown by staining intestinal epithelium sections of infected mice for C. rodenlhim O antigen 01522. In addition. WT, ΔEspF- and ΔMap-infected mice all have similar numbers \n\n of C. rodeniiwn in shed stools, and similar levels of colonic hyperplasia demonstrated by increased colon weight |Mundy, R. et al., sιιpra\\.\n\n\n10234] WT and mutant C. roάentium were prepared by incubation with shaking at 37\"C for 8 hours in LB broth medium. After 8 hours, the bacterial density was assessed at an optical density of 600 ntn and confirmed by plating of serial dilutions. Inoculation of mice was by oral administration with 2.5xlO\ns\n (for C3H/HeOuJ strain) or 2x10\n9\n (for C57BL/6J strain) colony forming units (CFU). Before inoculation, mice were deprived of food and water for 8-12 hours. Tissues were collected for immunostaining and/or flow cytometry at times indicated after inoculation. Mice treated with Q-VD-OPH pan-caspase inhibitor (SM Biochemicals)\n7\n received intraperitoneal injections of 0.4 mg in 15% DMSO/85% PBS at 90 minutes, 24 h, and 48 h after inoculation. C3H/HeOuJ mice also were treated on days 3 and 5 (total 5 doses) and C57BL/6J were treated on daj's 4, 6, and 8 (total 6 doses). Mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (Sigma-Aldrich) were given water containing 2.5 mg/mL DSS for seven days [Okayasu, I. ct al. (1990) Gastroenterology 98 (3):694] at which point the DSS-watcr was removed and replaced with plain water for the remainder of the experiment. For anti-CD3-injcctcd mice, mice were injected with 20 μg of anti-CD3 (clone 2C 1 1 ) i.p. three times with an interval of two days and sacrificed four hours after the final injection [Kamanaka, M. et al. (2006) Immunity 25 (6):941J\n\n\nFlaw cytometry\n\n\n[0235J T cells were stimulated for four hours with 0.1 μg/mL Phorbol 12-myristatc 13- acetate (PMA\n5\n Sigma), 0.5 μg/mL ionomycin calcium salt, from Streptomyces conglobatits (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 μg/mL Brcfeldin A, from Eupeniciffium brefeldanium (Sigma- Aldrich). Cells were then pelleted and resuspendcd in cold FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.1 % NaNs and 1% heat-inactivated FBS). Cells were surface stained for 20 minutes at 4\n0\nC with either: 1) APC-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (clone GK 1.5), or 2) APC-conjugatcd anti-CD3 mAb (clone 17A2), PE-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (clone GKl.5), and FITC- conjugated anti-CD8α mAb (clone 53-6.7)(all from eBioscicnce™), in FACS buffer. Cells were then fixed and pcrmcabilized using the IC Staining kit (eBioscience™) according to manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications (washing four times with perrneabilization buffer before incubation with intracellular cytokine antibody). For Foxp3 staining in Figures 8 and 15, eBioscience™ Foxp3 staining kit was used according to \n\n manufacturer's instructions. Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained intracellularly with PE-conjugated anti-IL- 17 mAb {clone TC 11 - 18H 10, BD. Pharmingen) or PE- conjugatcd anti-Foxp3 mAb (clone FJK-J 6s, cBioscicncc™), and FITC-conjugated anti- IFN-γ mAb (clone XMGl .2, BD, Pharmingen) or FITC-conjugated anti-IL- 10 mAb (clone JES5-16E3, BD, Pharmingen). Samples were acquired on a FACSCaiibur™ (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer, and data analyses were conducted using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).\n\n\nTGF- β bioassay\n\n\n102361 Analysis of bioactivc TGF-β was performed as previously described in Tesscur, I. ct al.(2006) BMC Cell Biol 7; 15. MFB-Fl 1 mouse fibroblast cells stably transfectcd with a reporter plasmid consisting of TGF-β-rcsponsive Smad-binding elements coupled to a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene (SBE-SE AP) were seeded at 3x10\n4\n cells/well in 96-wcll flat bottom tissue culture plates and cultured overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicilϊin'streptomycin (DMEM/P/S). Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 50 μL scrum-free DMEM for 2 hours. Conditioned medium from DC was diluted 1:5 in scrura-free DMEM/P/S and 5 μL was added to the MFB-FI 1 ceils. For detection of total TGF-β, diluted conditioned medium was activated by adding 1.5 μL 6M HCl to 150 μL of sample and incubating 10 minutes at room temperature. Neutralization was performed by adding 1.5 μL 6M MaOH, 10 μL of the cultured supernatant from MFB-Fl 1 cells was collected after 24 hours. SEAP activity was measured using Great EscAPc™ SEAP Reporter System 3 (Qontcch, Mountain View. CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 96-wcll white/flat bottom plates. Lucifcrasc activity was measured with a FLUOStar Optima reader (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC), For each sample, the concentration of biologically active TGF-β was calculated as follows: (lucifcrasc activity of bio-activc TGF-β/lucifcrase activity for total TGF-β) x 100.\n\n\nT cell proliferation assay\n\n\n102371 Day 5 WT C57BL/6J BMDC were left untreated or cultured for 6-8 hours with heat-killed C rodentnnn at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were harvested from uninfected or infected mice that had been treated or not with Q-VD-OPH and MLN cells were isolated. These cells were incubated either with \n\n untreated BMDC in the presence or absence of 0.1 μg/mL anti-CD3 or with C. rodentium- exposed BMDC at two different DC:MLN cell ratios in triplicate in 96-wcll round-bottom plates. At 72 hours, 1 μCi of \n3\nH-thymidine was added to each well. 18 hours after pulsing with Η-thymidinc, cells were harvested with a multiple-sample harvester and counted with a Wallac 1450 microbeta PLUS liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).\n\n\nRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR\n\n\n10238) T cells cultured for 48 hours under the indicated conditions were lysed and RNA isolated by TRIzolΦ\n)\n extraction (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For restimulated T cell cultures, cells were collected after four days and plated on new plates coated with anti-CD3 in the presence or absence of 20 ng/mL recombinant (rra)IL-23 (eBioscience™) for six hours.

Reactions were run in duplicates and samples were normalized to the internal controls β-actin and HPRT. \"Fold inductions\" were calculated using the ΔΔCt method relative to T cells activated under neutral conditions (No cytokines or CM).\n\n\nEnzyme-linked imrmmoabsorbent assays (ELISA)\n\n\n10241 ] Supernatant from cultured DC or T cells was collected at the times indicated. ELISA monoclonal Ab (mAb) pairs used were as noted below in Table 1. All mAbs were obtained from BD, Pharmingen except the IL-23p l 9 capture antibody, clone 5B2, from cBioscicncc™. All ELISA antibodies were used at 1.5 μg/mL capture and Ϊ.5 μg/mL \n\n detection with the following exceptions: IL-23pl9 capture mAb was used at 4 μg/mL, IL- 10 capture and detection niAbs were used at 2 μg/mL.\n\n\nTable 1: ELISA Antibody Pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nDC Cytokine Production Following Concomitant Exposure to LPS and Apoptotic Cells\n\n\n[0242] The following example demonstrates the cytokines produced by DC following exposure to various inflammatory stimuli and the ability of treated DC to stimulate Tu 17 cell differentiation.\n\n\n[0243] It was next determined which innate immune recognition events trigger simultaneous synthesis of IL-6 and TGF-β. Whereas phagocytosis of apoptotic cells induces TGF-β synthesis by macrophages', IL-6 synthesis is strongly induced in innate immune cells when microbial structures activate pattern recognition receptors like Toll-like receptors (TLRs)\n6\n' \niA\n. However, it was unknown whether concomitant ligation of TLRs during phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells might constitute a scenario where IL-6 and TGF-β may be induced together.\n\n\n[0244] In these experiments, cither apoptotic neutrophils isolated from the peritoneal cavity of mice following injection of live E. coli (Apop./Ncutrophils/E coli), or apoptotic B-cells carrying the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) generated from LPS-treated B- cells (ApopA20/LPS-blasts)\nl:>\n were used. As controls for the requirement for a microbe or TLR adjuvant for T\nH\n 17 induction, either apoptotic neutrophils (Apop ./Neutrophils) or apoptotic A20 B cells (Apop./A20) were used. Bone marrow DC were stimulated with\n\n\nLPS or phagocytic cargo as indicated in Figure 1 and cytokine production was measured by \n\n ELISA in culture supematants following 18 hours of culture. DC that phagocytosed apoptoτic LPS-biasts secreted more TGF-β and IL-23 than DC treated with free LPS and similar amounts of IL-6 where the concentration of free LPS chosen approximated IL-6 levels induced by apoptotic LPS-blasts (Figure 1). Importantly, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and apoptotic LPS-blasts uniquely induced production of biologically active TGF-β whereas free LPS did not (Figure 1). Notably, despite similar IL-6 levels, the level of TL- 12 produced by DC following phagocytosis of apoptotic LPS B cell-blasts was consistently lower than that in response to free LPS (Figure 1 ), which may also favor Tn 17 over T\nH\n I development.\n\n\n[02451 The mRNA expression of DC stimulated in vitro by the stimuli indicated in Figure 2 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. Analysis by qPCR of RNA from these DC further showed induction of IL-6, IL-23pl9, IL-12p35, IL-12p4(). IL-IO, and TNF family member, TLlA (Tnfi/15), which promotes T\nH\n I 7 proliferation\n16\n, in response to apoptotic LPS-blasts and apoptotic ueutrophiis/E. colt. For all cytokines tested, the levels of induction were similar to levels induced by free LPS (Figure 2). These transcripts were also induced in DC in response to infected apoptotic neutrophils, but not to uninfected apoptotic B-ccIls or uninfected apoptotic neutrophils (Figure 2). The raw data was normalized to β-actin and HPRT and expressed as fold-induction over unstimulated DC.\n\n\nExample 3 T\nJI\n 17 and T\necg\n Cell Differentiation\n\n\n[0246] The following example describes whether the cytokine milieu created by the conditions of DC activation described in Example 2, above, is conducive for T\nH\nI 7 induction.\n\n\n10247] Naive (CD25\n~\nTD62L\nhieli\nCD44\nknv\n) CD4 T-cells, isolated from C57BL/6J mice and activated with 4 μg anti-CD3 and 2 μg/mL anti-CD2B plus anti-lL-4, were cultured for three days in conditioned media (CM) derived from DC that phagocytosed apoptotic LPS- blasts or apoptotic B cells (control) with or without IFN-γ neutralizing antibody. Following rcstimulation with PMA and ionoemycin, the CD4 T-cclls cultured with DCCM-apoptotic \n\n LPS-blasts secreted IL- 17, as determined by ELlSA of the culture supernatants, strongly suggesting differentiation into the Tn 17 lineage (Figure 3, filled bars).\n\n\n10248] Standard in vitro protocols for generating TH 17 require neutralizing the antagonistic effects of the cytokine iπterferon-γ (IFN-γ)'\n1 1Ul\n \", and TLR ligands arc classically considered to induce THI cells producing IFN-y\n6\n. Neutralization of this cytokine allowed some induction of IL- 17 secreting (TL-I T) CD4 T-cells by CM from DC treated with free LPS (Figure 3, open bars). In contrast, antϊ-IFN-γ was not required for IL- 17 production by T-cells activated in DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts (Figure 3, open bars), indicating that DC stimulation by TLR ligands within the context of apoptotic cells creates particularly efficient conditions, which more closely mimic physiological settings, for the generation of IL-17' CD4 T-cclls. No IL-17 was detected when naϊvc CD4 T-cells were cultured in the presence of CM from DC that phagocytoscd apoptotic B-ccllε not carrying TLR ligands (DCCM-apoptotic B-cells), and supplementation of this CM with IL-6 restored IL-17 production, indicating the presence of TGF-β and reinforcing the contribution of TLRs to IL-6 production (Figure 3, filled bars). Here, anti-IFN-y consistently increased the levels of IL-17 (Figure 3, open bars).\n\n\n10249] Moreover, qPCR performed with RNA from sorted naive CD4 T-cells after 48 hours of culture with DCCM from the indicated groups. qPCR analysis showed high induction of the TH 17 lineage specific transcription factor RORγf\n4\n (Rorc) and IL- 17A when these cells were activated in the presence of DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts, and DCCM- apoptotic B-cells supplemented with IL-6 (Figure 4). Notably, induction of the IL-10 family cytokine, IL-22, synthesis of which is induced by ΪL-23\n1\n ', was greatest in response to DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts (Figure 4), consistent with the ability of apoptotic LPS- blasts, but not apoptotic cells, to induce IL-23 cytokine synthesis (Figure 1). IL-22 was not induced upon stimulation with TGF-β plus IL-6, likely due to the absence of IL-23 under these conditions (Figure 4). As expected, none of the T-cells, except the ones activated in the presence of IL- 12, expressed the T\nH\n1 lineage-specific transcription factor T-bet\n18\n (Figure 4). Collectively, these results confirmed that IL-I T CD4 T-cells generated in response to phagocytosis of TLR ligand-containing apoptotic cells were bonaflde THI 7 cells. \n\n [02501 Because development of T,\nβ\n« cells is reciprocally related to Tjil 7 cells\n10\n expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor unique to T\nieg\n cells\n19\n was examined. After 3 days of culture with DCCM from the indicated groups, T cells were rcstimulatcd with PMA and ionomycin for 4 hours with Brcfcldin A before intracellular cytokine staining for IL-17 and IFN-γ was performed, and expression of these cytokines was determined by FACS. In Figure 5, FACS plots are gated on CD4+ cells and quadrant percentiles of cells staining positive for the indicate cytokines arc shown.\n\n\n[ 025 i I IL- 1 T CD4 T-cells developed in DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts and DCCM- apoptoxic neutrophils//;. cσΛ and, as expected, did not express Foxp3 (Figure 5). In contrast, Foxp3-cxprcssing cells were generated in response to DCCM-apoptotic B-cclls or DCCM- apoptotic neutrophils. No IL- 17 producing cells were obtained under these conditions, indicating preferential T\nrcg\n development (Figure 5). Addition of 1L-6 to DCCM-apoptotic B-cclls or to DCCM-apoptotic neutrophils restored IL-17 production and markedly impaired Foxp3 expression (Figure 5). Quantitative RT-PCR showed Foxp3 induction inversely mirrored RORγt, with highest induction when T-ccIIs were activated in the presence of DCCM-apoptotic B-cclls or TGF-β (Figure 4). Foxp3 induction was impaired when IL-6 was added consistent with the ability of IL-6 to inhibit Foxp3 induction\n10\n, and when T-cells were activated in the presence of DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts (Figure 4), which contains IL-ό (Figure 1 ). Although Foxp3 induction was not completely abrogated under the latter two conditions, this had no negative impact on Tn 17 development (Figures 3 and 5) perhaps owing to the high levels of RORγt induced under these two conditions (Figure 4. RORc panel). Persistence of Foxp3 transcripts in the TGF-β plus IL-6 conditions (unlike previous reports \n\"\n ) may be a consequence of the comparatively high levels of TGF-β (5ng/ml) that were used. This concentration was chosen as it approximates the average concentrations of TGF-β present within DCCM-apoptotic B-cclls, or DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts (Figure 1). These data collectively demonstrate that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by DC instructed development of Foxp3 expressing T\nreg\n cells and phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells (which have TLR ligands) instructed development of TnI 7 cells.\n\n\n102521 Figure 6 shows that the absence of TLR signaling in DC impairs TnI 7 cell development in response to phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells, and supports T\nreg\n development instead. Naϊvc CD4 T cells were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and activated \n\n with 4 μg anti-CD3 and 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 plus anti-IL-4 with conditioned medium from wild-type C57BL/6J, Myd88 /Trif \n'\n , or Tlr4\n~\n\"\n\"\n BMDC under the indicated conditions. IL-6 and TGF-β cytokines were added to T cell - DC conditioned medium cultures. Cells were recovered after three days and surface staining for CD4 and intracellular cytokine staining for Foxp3 were performed. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and in the plots shown in Figure 6, plots are gated on CD4' cells and quadrant percentiles of cells staining positively for the indicated cytokines or markers are shown. Under these conditions, CM from DC derived from Myd88~\n\"\n Trif\n'\n mice (Figure 6, where absence of the signaling adaptors MyD88 and Trif abrogates responses through all TLRs\n14\n) or Tϊr4\n\"\n mice (Figure 6, where absence of TLR4 abrogates responses to LPS\n14\n) did not support Tn 17 development, but rather supported development of Foxp3 expressing T\nrc£\n cells.\n\n\n|Q253] Figure 7 demonstrates that phagocytosis of necrotic cells by BMDC docs not induce THI 7 differentiation. Naive CD4 T cells were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and activated with 4 μg anti-CD3 and 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 plus anti-IL-4 with conditioned medium from C57BL/6J BMDC that plmgocy tosed either apoptotic A20 LPS blasts, apoptotic A20 cells, or necrotic A20 cells. Cells were recovered after three days and restimulated with PMA plus ionomycin with Brefeldin A before intracellular cytokine staining for IL-17 and IFN-γ, and analysis by flow cytometry. Plots were gated on CD4+ ceils and quadrant percentiles of cells staining positively for the indicated cytokines arc shown.\n\n\n[0254] The TLR ligand and apoptotic cell cannot be administered as separate entities as this combination does as such does not lead to the induction of TH 17 responses. The TLR ligand must be physically incorporated and present within the apoptotic cell in order to effectively mimic an infected apoptotic cell and induce a Tn 17 response. See Example 5 and Figure 25 below.\n\n\n[0255] Next, naϊve CD4 T-cclts were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and activated with 4 μg anti-CD3 and 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 plus anti-IL-4 with CM from C57BL/6J (WT) BMDC that had phagocytosed apoptotic LPS B cell-blasts. Neutralizing mAbs were added (or not) as indicated (anti-TGF-β 1 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL; anti-IL-23pl9 5 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL; anti-iL-6 1 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL). After four days, cells were re-plated on anti-CD3-coated plates for 48h. Cytokines were quantified in supematants by ELISA. \n\n As shown in Figure 8, development of T\nH\nI 7 cells in the presence of DCCM-apoptotic LPS- blasts was severely compromised in a dose dependent manner in the presence of neutralizing antibody to TGF-β, with no further synergistic inhibition with a neutralizing antibody to the pl9 polypeptide of [L-23 (Figure H). Neutralization of pl9 alone still permitted the existence of a fraction of Tπl7 ceils, consistent with the role of JL -23 in expanding but not initiating development of these cells (Figure 8). Neutralization of IL-6 also strongly inhibited IL- 17 secretion (Figure 8). Its requirement was further documented by the fact that U-6\"\n\"\nDCCM-apopιotic LPS-blasts failed to support development of Tn 17 cells (Figure 9). Addition of exogenous IL-6 to DCCM-apoptotic B-cells from both WT and 11-6\n\" \"\nDC, led to similar levels of IL-17 production from activated naϊve CD4 T-ccIls (Figure 9). Figure 10 shows the levels of IL-6 and IL- 12 produced by CD4 T cells following culture with DCCM treated with the conditions shown (resting, LPS. apoptotic B cells, or LPS blasts) in WT or IL-6 \n\" \"\n mice. IL-6 \n\"\n'\n\"\n failed to produce IL-6, but produced similar levels of IL- 12 following exposure to LPS or apoptotic A20 LPS blasts. Collectively, these data suggest that DC phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells results in production of cytokines strongly conducive for T\nH\n 17 differentiation.\n\n\nExample 4 Role of Toll-like Receptor Signaling in T\nϊ(\n17 Development\n\n\n10256] The following example describes whether development of IL- 17\n\"\n CD4 T-cells required TLR signaling within DC upon phagocytosis of infected apoptotic neutrophils or apoptotic LPS-blasts.\n\n\n10257 [ Under the same conditions as in Example 3, CM from DC derived from Myd88\n~\n 'Trif \"mice (Figure 1 1, where absence of the signaling adaptors MyD88 and Trif abrogates responses through all TLRs'\n4\n) or Tlr4\n'/\"\nmice (Figure 12, where absence of TLR4 abrogates responses to LPS\n1\"1\n) did not support Tni7 development. However, consistent with the lack of involvement of TLRs in recognition of apoptotic cells per se, generation of T\nH\nI 7 cells was unaffected by the absence of TLR signaling under conditions when DCCM-apoptotic B-cells or DCCM-apoptotic neutrophils were supplemented with IL-6 (Figures 1 1 and 12). Furthermore, DC derived from MyD88\n\" '\nTrif \n\"\nand Tlr4\n* \"\n mice were able to direct induction of IL- 17\n\"\n CD4 T-cclls when stimulated with curdlan. a fungal β-glucan that activates DC\n\n\n19 \n\n independently of TLR4, Trif or MyD88, and induces T\nH\n 17 development when TGF-β is concomitantly present\n21\n.\n\n\nExample 5 Induction of IL-10 Regulatory Component\n\n\n[0258J The following example describes the ability of TLR ligands and apoptotic cells to induce IL-IO secreting, \"regulatory\" T cells in addition to Tn 17 cells.\n\n\n[0259] Given the reported implications of Tn 17 cells in autoimmunity, and the present finding that infected apoptotic cells can drive Tn 17 development, it was next asked whether this process is accompanied by the induction of a regulatory component that might curb the pathogenic potential of these T-cells. Naϊvc CD4 T-cclls were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and activated with 4 μg anti-CD3 and 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 plus anti-IL-4 with CM from C57BL/6J, Myd88\"Trif '\n\"\nor Tlr4\n\" \"\nBMDC under the indicated conditions. For the data shown in Figure 13, 17 and 24, after three days, cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for four hours with Brcfeldin A before intracellular cytokine staining for IL- 17 and IFN-γ, or IL- 17 and IL-H), and analyzed by flow cytometry. Plots were gated on CD4\n1\n cells and quadrant percentiles of cells staining positively for the indicated cytokines are shown.\n\n\n[0260J It was found that 25% of the IL-17\" CD4 T-cells induced by DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts, also secreted IL-IO, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine\n22\n (Figure 13) (for IFN-γ, IL- 17 and Foxp3 profiles, see Figure 24). Notably, a distinct IL-K) secreting (IL- HF) CD4 T-cell population that did not secrete IL- 17 was also induced. Similar 'IL- 10\nH\n only' cells and 'dual IL-IO\n\"\n and IL-I T ' cells were induced in response to DCCM-apoptotic B-cells supplemented with IL-6 (Figure 13). It was found that induction of IL-10 transcripts in response to DCCM-apoptotic B-cells, although by staining IL-Hf CD4 T- cells could not be detected in response to apoptotic cells alone, perhaps due to differences in the kinetics of expression (Figure 13). Consistent with previous reports\n23\n'\n24\n, TGF-β plus IL-6 also induced three distinct populations: \"IL-I T only', 'IL-IO\n*\n' only, and 'dual IL-10\n\"\n and IL-17\n*\n' CD4 T cells (Figure 13).\n\n\n[0261 ] In some experiments, after four days, cells were re-ρlatcd on anti-CD3 -coated plates for 48h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/niL IL-23. Re-stimulation of these \n\n cultured CD4 T-cells in the presence of IL-23 oniy slight!}' increased the levels of IL- 17 produced, consistent with lL-23\n'\ns primary role in expanding TuI 7 cells\n10\"12\n (Figure 14, top panel). However, the total levels of IL-K\n)\n produced were markedly impaired, as previously reported\n2'1\n, when IL-23 was present upon rc-sthmilation (Figure 14, bottom panel). In contrast to IL- 17, 30-45% of lL-10 secretion remained in response to DCCM-apoptotic LPS-blasts or DCCM-ncutrophils/ii. coll when TLR signaling was absent in the phagocytic DC (Figures 15 and 16), and was confined to the 'IL- K\n)\"\n only' cells (Figure 17). As expected, all three populations were intact in response to MyD88\n\"\n Trif \n\"\nDCCM- apoptotic+IL-6 compared to WT DCCM-apoptotic+IL-6 (Figure 17). These data collectively suggest that the initial development of IL- 17 secreting cells in response to apoptosis of infected cells is accompanied by concomitant induction of IL-IO secreting populations. IL-10 production may serve to limit excessive inflammatory responses mediated by these cells during infections\n22\n. Moreover, the inflammatory cytokines prevailing upon reactivation of these cells may directly impact their IL-I O-røediated rather than EL-17-mediatεd effector functions.\n\n\n[0262] In one set of experiments, the results of which are shown in Figure 25, naive CD4 T cells were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and activated with 4 μg anti-CD3 and 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 plus anti-IL-4 with CM from wild-type C57BL/6J BMDC under various conditions, as indicated in the Figure. When apoptotic cells and LPS were co-admiπistercd, but as separate entities (Apoptotic A20 + LPS), a surprising result was found. CM derived from DC stimulated with LPS during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells induced neither IL-17 nor IL-10 secreting cells despite the expectation that LPS would induce DC production of IL-6 (Figure 25). However, when DC were stimulated with apoptotic A20/LPS blasts (where the apoptotic cell and TLR ligand arc physically associated), CM derived from these cultures induced IL-17 and IL-10 secreting CD4 T cells (Figure 25). These results demonstrated that the TLR ligand and apoptotic cell should be delivered to DC as one entity (which allows them to be internalized together by a DC. These results also strengthened the discovery of the present invention that an infected apoptotic cell is uniquely capable of inducing TH 17 responses and that TLR ligands must be physically present within the apoptotic cell to accurately mimic an infected apoptotic cell. These results also demonstrated that the T\nH\n17-inducing effects of A20/LPS blasts were riot due to contaminating free LPS. Furthermore, CM from cultures of DC stimulated with apoptotic A20 cells and IL-6 (Apoptotic A20+IL-6) stimulated IL- 17 and IL- 10 secreting CD4 T \n\n ceils, indicating that addition of IL-6 can overcome the need for the presence of a TLR ligand {or adjuvant) associated as a single entity with an apoptotic cell for the induction of a Ti[17-inducing DC.\n\n\nExample 6 Blockade of Apoptosis\n\n\n102631 The following example describes whether blockade of apoptosis impairs development of Tn 17 cells in vivo during bacterial infections known to trigger TH 17 responses.\n\n\n[0264] Citrobacier rodentium is a rodent pathogen that serves as a model for human infections with the attaching and effacing enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coif. C3H/HeOuJ mice were infected orogastrically with C. rodenύum wild-type (WT), C. rodentium ΔEspF, or C. rodentium ΔMap, and/or treated with 20 mg/kg caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH intraperitoneally on days 0, 1 , 2, 3, and 5. Mice were sacrificed on day 6 and colons were harvested and frozen for tissue sectioning and TUNEL analysis.\n\n\n(0265) Figure 1 H shows the inhibition of apoptosis by pan-caspasc inhibitor Q-VD- OPH. A20 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of anti-Fas (artti-CD95) to induce apoptosis with or without the indicated concentrations of Q-VD-OPH for four hours before staining for Annexin-V and 7-AAD and analysis by flow cytometry. When A20 LPS blasts were incubated with Q-VD-OPH during Fas treatment, they were protected from undergoing Fas-induced apoptosis as shown by Anncxin V/7AAD staining. In the absence of Q-VD-OPH treatment, 100% of the cells become apoptotic at later time points.\n\n\n102661 Importantly, orogastrie infection with this pathogen resulted in massive apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells\n23\n'\n26\n , as measured by TUNEL staining and quantified in the graph in Figure 19. Moreover, IL-17' CD4 T-cells were increased in number and predominate within the lamina propria\n1 ll π\n (LP) of C. rodentium infected mice (shown in Figure 20), to a lesser degree in intraepithelial lymphocytes and Peyer's patches, and not detectable in the mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 23) and spleen. Such infection also led to increased numbers of IL-17\n4\n CD4 T-cells in the small intestinal and colonic LP of the more susceptible C3H/HeOuJ mice\n26\n (Figure 21 ). \n\n [02671 Treatment of C. rodenlium infected mice with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD- OPH resulted in decreased numbers of TUNEL\n\"\n cells (Figure 19) and also profoundly diminished ihc number of IL- 17\n'\n CD4 T-cells in both strains of infected mice, and in C57BL/6J mice to levels similar to those found in uninfected mice (Figures 20 and 21). Thus, caspasc inhibition results in blockade of epithelial cell apoptosis in a relevant infection model in vivo, and profoundly interferes with the generation of a T\nn\n 17 response.\n\n\n102681 Given that Q-VD-OPH is a broad-spectrum caspasc inhibitor, it likely affects processes independent of apoptosis, like activation of the iπflammasotne. which is important for generation of immune responses\n27\n. Secretion of cytokines such as IL-I and IL-J 8 may thus be perturbed by Q-VD-OPH. Therefore, the requirement for apoptosis in Tnl7 induction was tested by a fundamentally different approach, based on the usage of a C. rodenlium mutant incapable of inducing apoptosis. EspF (EPEC-sccretcd protein F) and Map (mitochondrial associated protein) are effectors encoded by the locus of cntcrocytc cffacement (LEE) pathogenicity island\n28\n. Despite similar colonization (Figure 19), shedding in the stool, and colonic hyperplasia, only WT and ΔMap induce apoptosis and tight junction disruption in vitro and in vivo, while ΔEspF mutants fail to do so\n25\n'\n26\n' \n2% m\n. This is indicated by the increased numbers of apoptotic TUNEL\n\"\n cells in the distal colon of WT- and ΔMap-infcctcd mice, but not ΔEspF-infccted compared to uninfected mice (Figure 19). Thus, development of Tn 17 cells in the intestinal LP in response to infection with these strains of C. rυdenthim was assessed. Equivalent numbers of CD4 and CD8 T- cclls were present in the LP of all WT-, ΔEspF- and ΔMap-infccted C57BL/6J (Figure 20, leftmost panels) and C3H/Hc0uJ mice. Compared to uninfected mice, modest increases were observed in IL- 17\n\"\n CD4 T-cells in the small intestinal LP in response to WT and ΔMap infection, and not in response to ΔEspF infection (Figures 20 and 21 , small intestine panels). WT and ΔMap infection induced larger increases in the FL- 17\n\"\n CD4 T-cells in the colonic LP, but notably the numbers of IL- 17 ' CD4 T-cells in ΔEspF-infectcd mice were similar to those in uninfected controls (Figures 20 and 21, colon panels). In contrast to IL- 17, similar levels of IFN-γ\n\"\n CD4 T-ccIls were found in the small intestinal LP of C57BL/6J mice infected with WT, ΔEspF, and ΔMap C. rodenlium (Figure 20, small intestine panels) consistent with intact expression of the bacterial outer membrane protein, intimin, reported to drive TnI responses in C. rodenfium infections\n1\n*' \". \n\n 102691 Because ΔEspF can neither induce apoptosis nor disrupt tight junctions, it remained possible that tight junction disruption per se could drive the observed T\nH\n17 response. However, tight junction disruption should not be affected in Q-VD-OPH treated WT C. rodenlium infected mice as Q-VD-OPH despite reducing apoptosis, has no effects on infection induced barrier function\n30\n. Furthermore, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- induced damage of the intestinal epithelium did not increase IL-17\n*\n CD4 T-celis over uninfected controls (Figure 22). For DSS experiments, C57BL/6 mice treated with DSS and sacrificed on day 9. Lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) were isolated from small intestines (srn. Intest) and colons. LPL were then restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 hours with Brefeldin A before surface staining for CD4 and intracellular cytokine staining for IL- 17 and IFN-γ, and analysis by flow cytometry. Plots were gated on CD4\n'\n cells and quadrant percentiles of cells staining positively for the indicated cytokines arc shown. These results argue against a role for disruption of intestinal epithelium integrity as a stimulus for TH 17 development.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nTLR Ligand-carrying or Infected Apoptotic Cell Engineered to Express an Exogenous Immune Antigen\n\n\n[0270J Generation of a TLR ligand-catrying or infected apoptotic cell engineered to express an exogenous immune antigen derived of microbial or host origin is desirable for inducing a T\nH\n17 immune response directed against a tumor-associated immune antigen as a form of tumor immunotherapy, or for inducing a TH 17 immune response directed against a particular immunodominant antigen expressed by a given bacterium. Such apoptotic cells may be prepared, by way of non-limiting example, by the following method:\n\n\n10271 ] 1) A cell line is transfectcd with the exogenous immune antigen of interest (e.g., a tumor-associated antigen, an immunodominant antigen associated with an autoimmune disease or chronic inflammatory disease). This cell line cart be a phagocytic cell line, such as one of monocytic or macrophage origin. The antigen may be a tumor-associated antigen, for example where Tn 17 immune responses are desired against a given tumor, or an immunodominant antigen derived from a bacterium. TMs antigen can be expressed from a recombinant mammalian expression vector or viral vector engineered to encode the gene sequence for the antigen. This gene sequence can either be the full gene or a portion of it \n\n encompassing immunodominant regions, if these arc known. Clones derived from this transfected cell line are then propagated where they stably express the exogenous immune antigen at high levels. Alternatively, a tumor cell line is chosen that represents the tumor in the mammal. This tumor cell line would naturally express the tumor-associated antigen.\n\n\n[02721 2) TLR Iigands arc introduced into the cell line. For non-phagocytic cell lines, a TLR. ligand such as CpG or Poly(l:C) may be clectroporatcd into the cell line. For phagocytic cell lines {e.g., a macrophage or monocytic cell line), an innocuous microbe such as E. coli K12 may be given to the cells at a ratio of 10 microbes to one cell. Alternatively, attenuated Mycobacterium bovi.s BCG strain may be used, for example. For safety, the innocuous microbe is further inactivated by exposure to heat. UV, or fixative. Viable microbes are not necessary to induce the desired Tn i 7 response. The microbe here serves only to provide a source of mixed TLR Iigands.\n\n\n102731 A variation of the above method is to choose a phagocytic cell line to which an inactivated form of the infecting microbe is given. In this variation, step I above is eliminated. For example, if TuI 7 responses against a respiratory infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae are desired, a phagocytic monocytic cell line is given heat-inactivated K. pneumonia at a ratio of 10 bacteria to one cell for a period of 30-45 minutes. The cells would then internalize the inactivated K. pneumonia thus in effect carry not only the TLR Iigands derived from K. pneumonia, but all the exogenous antigens derived from K. pneumonia as well. The cells are then washed to remove excess extracellular K. pneumonia that may not have been internalized.\n\n\n[0274] 3) Apoptosis is induced in the transfected cell line or tumor cell line now carrying TLR Iigands. Alternatively, apoptosis is induced in the phagocytic cell line following its internalization of the desired microbe. The trigger chosen to induce apoptosis depends on the cell type. This trigger can be UV irradiation at a dose sufficient to induce Annexin-V\n\"\n 7-AAD\n~~\n at early time points (4 hours). High doses of U V should be avoided as these induce necrosis (which does not induce Tu 17 responses) measured by the appearance of Annexin-V\n\"\n 7-AAD\n\"\n as early as 2 hours after UV irradiation. Other triggers might be anti-Fas antibody or treatment with Staurosporinc. Staurosporine (antibiotic AM- 2282 or STS) is a natural product originally isolated from bacterium Strep tomyces staurosporeus [Omura S, et al. (1977) J. Antibiot. 30 (4): 275-282J. \n\n Example 8\n\n\nApoptotic Cell Engineered to Express an Exogenous Immune Antigen\n\n\n[0275] Generation of an apoptotic cell engineered to express an exogenous immune antigen is desirable for inducing a Ti\nCg\n immune response. This immune response may be directed against a tumor-associated immune antigen as a form of tumor immunotherapy, or for inhibiting THI 7 immune responses directed against an exogenous antigen of microbial origin. Such apoptotic cells may be prepared, for example, as follows:\n\n\n102761 1) A cell line is transfected with the exogenous immune antigen of interest. For example, the antigen may be a tumor-associated antigen where Tπl7 immune responses arc desired against a given tumor or an immunodominant antigen derived from a bacterium or other source. This antigen can be expressed from a recombinant mammalian expression vector or viral vector engineered to encode the gene sequence for the antigen. This gene sequence can either be the full gene or a portion of it encompassing immunodominant regions if these are known. Clones derived from this transfected cell line are then propagated where they stably express the exogenous immune antigen at high levels. Alternatively, a tumor cell line is chosen that represents the tumor in the mammal. This tumor cell line would naturally express the tumor-associated antigen.\n\n\n[0277J 2) Apoptosis is induced in the transfected cell line or tumor cell line. The trigger chosen to induce apoptosis depends on the cell type. A skilled artisan will be able to determine the appropriate method for inducing apoptosis in a given cell line. This trigger can be UV irradiation at a dose sufficient to induce Anncxin-V\n\"\n 7-AAD\n\"\n at early time points (4 hours). High doses of UV should be avoided as these induce necrosis (which does not induce TnI 7 responses) measured by the appearance of Annexin-V\n\"\n 7- A AD\n1\n as early as 2 hours after UV irradiation. Other triggers might be anti-Fas antibody or treatment with Staurosporinc.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nInduction of a T^l 7 Response In vivo by Transfer of Tyl7-ϊnducing DC\n\n\n102781 Immunization with a Tjil7-mducing DC would be useful for inducing antigen- specific Tn 17 responses in vivo. An example of this approach is provided for the mouse, \n\n but may be modified for immunization of humans; an example of which is also provided below. Tu 17-inducing DC may be generated, for example, by the following steps:\n\n\n[ 02791 1 ) Derivation of murine DC : Bone marrow (BM)-derived GM-CSF DC cultures arc grown in RPMI medium supplemented with GM-CSF and 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS), phis J 00 μg/mL penicillin, 100 μg/rαL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, ] 0 mM HEPES, 1 nM sodium pyruvate, IX MEM nonessential amino acids, and 2.5 μM β- mercaptoethanol (all from Sigma-Aldrich. St. Louis. MO). as previously described [Blander, J. M. & Mcdzhitov, R. (2006) Nature 440, 808- 121.\n\n\n102801 2) Preparation of TLR-ligand carrying apoptotic cells expressing an exogenous immune antigen. The B cell line A20 stably expressing the exogenous immune antigen chicken ovalbumin (A20-OVA) is stimulated with 25 μg/mi of the TLR ligand LPS for 4 days to generate A20-OVA LPS blasts. Apoptosis of A20-OVA LPS blasts is induced by culturing cells with 0.5 μg/mL anti-CD95 (clone Jo2; BD) for four hours. Cells arc then washed and counted.\n\n\n10281 ] 3) Semi-adherent dendritic cells arc harvested on ice on day 5 of GM-CSF DC cultures, and re-platcd immediately in fresh GM-CSF medium at 1x10\n6\n cells/well in 24- wcll tissue culture-treated plates. Apoptotic A20-OVA LPS blasts arc added right away to the plates in the same medium and the cells were centrifuged for 2 mm at 2000 rpm. DC arc incubated with the phagocytic cells for a period of 4-6 hours then harvested and washed. These cells now provide the T\nH\nI 7-inducing DC.\n\n\n[0282J 4) Mice are injected intravenously with 10\" OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic CD4\n\"\n T cells called OT-ϊl (available from the Jackson Laboratory)- These OT- II T cells are introduced into the mouse as a readout for the activation of OVA-spccific Tϋl 7 CD4\ni\n T cells. T\nH\n I 7-inducing DC are injected intravenously into the tail veins of these mice 6 hours later.\n\n\n10283] 5) Immunized mice are sacrificed on day 6. Single cell suspensions are prepared from the spleens and lymph nodes of these mice. These suspensions are enriched for CD4' T cells by sorting with MACS® CD4\n4\n beads (Miltcnyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. A feeder layer of irradiated syngeneic splcnocytes is added to these CD4\n\"\n T ceils, and co-cultures arc immediately pulsed with \n\n various doses of OVA-derived peptide (0.1, 1, and K) μg/mt). The peptide sequence is ISQAVHAAHAE1NEAGR (SEQ ID NO: 91) and represents the immunodominant peptide derived from OVA encompassing residues 323-339 and presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Il molecule, I-A\nb\n. Culture supcrnatants arc harvested at 48 hours and the levels of the T\nH\n 17 cytokine IL- 17 are measured by ELlSA. Supematants arc also tested for the production of IFN-γ and 1L-4 as markers of T\nH\nI and TH2 responses, respectively. Production of IL- 17 by these CD4 T cells will indicate the induction of an antigen-specific Tu 17 immune response.\n\n\n[0284] 6) Protective immunity against tumor may be measured for example. Mice are immunized with the T\nH\n 17 inducing DC as in steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 above (without adoptive transfer of OT-II CD4\n1\n T cells). One week and 21 days later, mice are challenged with a small number (5x10\n4\n- 10\ns\n) of tumor cells expressing OVA. These tumor cells may be an EL4 thymoma cell line engineered to express the exogenous antigen OVA, or the B cell lymphoma A20 engineered to express OVA. Tumor cells are injected subcutancously and tumor development is monitored by measuring tumor size every 2 days over a period of 30 days. Tumor size will be measured on two perpendicular axes using a vernier caliper as described [Helmich, B. K. & Dutton, R. W. (2001) J Immunol 166, 6500-8; Tactic, R..ct al. (1987) Cancer Treat Rep 71, 297-304], and tumor size will be approximated by multiplying the measured widths and lengths [Tactic, R.,et al, supra ]. Mean tumor volume and standard errors of the mean will be averaged from 8-10 identically treated mice per group. Tumor development is compared between groups of immunized and unimmunized mice (8-10 mice per group, sex and age matched).\n\n\nModification for humans:\n\n\n10285 J Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are enriched from apheresis by Ficoll gradient centrifugation, frozen, and stored at -180\n0\nC as described [Palucka, A. K. el. al. (2006) ./. Immunotherapy. 29:545-557]. The T\nH\n 17-inducing DC vaccine is generated under cGMP conditions by culturing monocytes, enriched from thawed PBMCs by 2 hours adherence, for 6 days in X-VIVO 15 (BioWhittakcr. Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 1 % autologous scrum, GM-CSF (200 ng/mL, Leukine, Bcrlcx lnc.(Baycr HcalthCarc), Montvillc, NJ) and IL-4 (50 ng/mL, R&D Systems) as described [Palucka ct al, sitpra]. A third of the vaccine is loaded with control antigen keyhole limpet hcmocyanin (KLH) (Biosyn Corp., Carlsbad. CA), and two-thirds are loaded with apoptotic TLR-ligand \n\n carrying or microbe-infected cells expressing an exogenous immune antigen. The TLR- ligaiid carrying or microbe-infected apoptocic cells are prepared as described in Example 7, above. The exogenous antigen ma}' be a known immunodominant antigen derived from a bacterium, or other source, for example. Alternatively, if an immunodominant antigen is not defined, an inactivated form of, e.g., a bacterium is given to a phagocytic cell line, which is then induced to undergo apoptosis by UV irradiation (sec Example 7). Following the loading procedure, DC are activated by adding tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (20 ng/mL) and soluble CD40 ligand (200 ng/mL, both from R&D Systems) in the last 30 hours of culture as described fPalucka et al, supra\\. DC are defined by CDl 1 c surface expression, high levels of HLA-DR, CD83, and the costimulatory molecule CD80. The expression of the costimulatory molecule CD 80 serves as a phcnotype consistent with the activation and maturation of the TyI 7-inducing DC.\n\n\n[0286] An example of clinical monitoring can be in the form of intracellular cytokine analysis for IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-J 7. Frozen/thawed PBMCs are resuspendcd in 2x 10\n6\n cells/mL and 2x1 Q\n(\n' PBMCs are stimulated with either the immunodominant microbial derived peptide (K) μM), the control EXH, or heat inactivated bacteria at a dose of 2-5 bacteria to I cell. The mAbs anti-CD28/CD49d arc also added (BD Bioscicncc) as described (Palucka et al, supra]. At 2 hours of stimulation, Golgi-stop (BD Pharmingen) is added to the culture. At 6 hours of stimulation, cells are harvested, and stained with anti- CD3 PcrCP and/or anti-CD4 APC mAbs before fixation and pcrmcabilizalion with BD Cytofix/Cytopcrm solution (BD Pharmingen or cBioscicfl.ee). The cells arc then stained with anti-IFN-γ-FlTC and anti-IL-17-PE (BD Pharmingen or cBioscience). PBMCs should respond to KLH as this serves as a positive control. Staining for IL- ] 7 will indicate pruning (induction) of a T\nt\njl7 CD4 T cell response against the exogenous immune antigen.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n[0287J The results described herein demonstrate that sensing by DC of infected apoptotic cells during infections triggers instructive signals critical for TnI 7 development. They also explain the puzzling observations that some but not all microbial pathogens induce Tn 17 cells, and indicate the importance of examining the induction of apoptosis by pathogens inducing Tn 17 cells. Thus, Tn 17 cells can be induced not only by the dcctin-1 pathway in case of fungal infections\"', but also by the TLR pathway in. case of infected apoptotic cells. The findings of the present invention additionally show a novel role for \n\n apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions along epithelial surfaces. Thus, these data highly suggest that Tn 17 cells are critical in mediating effector functions during bacterial infections associated with significant apoptosis and tissue damage. In addition to neutrophil and macrophage recruitment, tissue repair processes uniquely associated with the effector functions of Tn 17 cells'\" \n!7\n would aid host response against these pathogens. Since Tu 17 cells have been correlated with autoimmune diseases\n1\"'\n', investigation of the pathways of innate recognition of infected apoptotic cells might lead to improved understanding of the causative defects in autoimmunity.\n\n\n[0288] Moreover, the present invention describes a previously unappreciated role of apoptosis on host-pathogen interactions across the intestinal epithelium. The association of Ti\nf\nl 7 cells with autoimmune diseases, combined with a previously unrecognized apoptotic cell component for instructing Tn 17 development in conjunction with TLR signaling, suggest breakdown in critical regulatory pathways that direct TuI 7 specificities to microbial components rather than to self. This novel understanding will be critical for design of the next generation of therapeutic agents and vaccines aimed at treating or preventing autoimmune diseases.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Weaver, C.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/169,058, filed Apr. 14, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention was made with government support under grants from the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights to this invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns chemotherapeutic molecules and compositions thereof, and methods of use thereof for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States and is a serious public health concern. The current generation of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of cancer is not curative for a majority of patients. For many cancer patients, the use of chemotherapy extends patient-life by only a few months and often results in serious side effects that reduce the quality of life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnticancer drugs that are utilized for cancer chemotherapy include cytotoxic nucleoside analogs (Pratt et al., “Antimetabolites” in The Anticancer Drugs, 2″ ed. Oxford University Press, New York. pp. 69-107 (1994)), such as analogs of the four nucleotides that are the principal components of DNA. Examples of cytotoxic analogs include the fluoropyrimidines (FPs) such as 5FU and FdU, which are analogs of Ura and dU, the precursor for dT, the arabinosyl nucleotides AraC and AraA, which are analogs of dC and dA, respectively, dFdC (gemcitabine), which is an analog of dC, and 6-mercaptopurine, which is an analog of dI, the precursor of dG.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA first aspect of the invention is a compound of the formula A-B-C, wherein: A is a first nucleic acid that specifically binds to an extracellular surface protein expressed by a cell of interest, B is an alkyl linker; and C is a second nucleic acid that hybridizes to a complementary nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the first nucleic acid is an aptamer. In some embodiments, the first nucleic acid is from 30 to 150 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the alkyl linker comprises C2-C6 loweralkyl. In some embodiments, the second nucleic acid is from 8 to 100 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the cell of interest is a cancer cell, microbial cell, or parasite cell. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid comprises an active compound, particularly cytotoxic nucleotides such as poly-FdUMP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second aspect of the present invention is a composition comprising a pair of compounds as described above and further herein, each member of the pair having a second nucleic acid that is complementary to and hybridized to the second nucleic acid of the other member of the pair. The composition may be provided in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention is the use of a composition as described above, and further herein, for treating and/or detecting cancer, or for the preparation of a medicament for treating and/or detecting cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention is a method of introducing a nucleic acid of interest into a cell of interest, comprising contacting a composition as described above, and further herein, to the cell under conditions in which the nucleic acid of interest is internalized into the cell. In some embodiments the method is carried out in vitro; in other embodiments the method is carried out in vivo. For example, the cell of interest may be a cancer cell in a subject afflicted with cancer (e.g., prostate cancer), and the contacting is carried out by administering the composition to the subject in an amount effective to treat or detect the cancer.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n. Fluorescence microscopy images of the PSMA01 DNA aptamer binding to (A) C4-2 cells; (B) LNCaP cells; (C)PC3 cells. (D) Binding of the A10-3 RNA aptamer to C4-2 cells. Live cells were incubated in PBS with 1×10\n−6 \nM Rhodamine-conjugated aptamer for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 min prior to visualization using an Olympus inverted microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n. Depiction of dimeric aptamer complex formation through Watson-Crick base pair formation. PSMA01 aptamers were synthesized with either a dA16 or dT16 tail and dimers were formed upon annealing the individual aptamer conjugates in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n. Fluorescence microscopy images of (A) a monomeric aptamer conjugate of PSMA01 with a dT16 tail; (B) a dimeric aptamer complex consisting of 1:1 ratio of monomeric PSMA01 conjugates with dA16 and dT16 tails; (C) the J591 mAb. All images were obtained using live C4-2 cells. For (A) and (B) cells were prepared as described in \nFIG. 4\n. For (C), live cells were incubated with J591, fixed with formalin, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X prior to addition of secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse) and post-fixed with formalin prior to visualization. Yellow arrows point to internalized signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n. Split x-y images using confocal microscopy to detect two fluorescent dyes (Quasar 670 and Quasar 570). The PSMA01 aptamer with the dA16 tail was labeled with Quasar 670 while the PSMA01 aptamer with the dT16 tail was labeled with Quasar 570. The unconjugated PSMA01 aptamer was also labeled with Quasar 570. In each panel of four images is shown: (A) Quasar 670 image; (B) Quasar 570 image; (C) overlay of (A) and (B); (D) Nomarski image. (Left) The PSMA01 monomeric aptamer is shown in the leftmost panel; (Center) Dimeric aptamer complex consisting of a 1:1 stoichiometry of PSMA01 aptamers with dA16 and dT16 tails; (Right) Dimeric Aptamer Complexes that also contain a flexible linker (see \nFIG. 5\n). The dimeric aptamer complex has greater internalized signal relative to the monomeric aptamer. Inclusion of the alkyl spacer results in enhanced cellular internalization relative to dimeric complexes that do not have alkyl spacer (see \nFIG. 9\n). Arrows point to internalized aptamer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n. Inclusion of flexible alkyl spacers (denoted by “X”) in dimeric aptamer complexes. The flexible linkers allow each aptamer to rotate relative to the linker construct to obtain maximal binding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n. Flow cytometry evaluation of the binding of fluorescently labeled aptamers and dimeric aptamer complexes with and without flexible linkers to C4-2 cells. Aptamer labeling with Quasar 570 and Quasar 670 was done as described in \nFIG. 8\n. The mean fluorescence intensity for the monomeric aptamer is right-shifted relative to background. Monitoring of Quasar 670 fluorescence clearly shows the dimeric complex shifted relative to background. Introduction of flexible linkers further increases the mean fluorescence intensity. The results are consistent with dimeric aptamer complexes having enhanced cellular binding relative to monomeric aptamers and with flexible linkers further enhancing cell binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n. Plot of tumor size versus time for PC3 xenografts in nude mice. Data are shown for four treatment groups (n=8 in each group): 1) \ncontrol\n 1; 2) FdUMP[10]; 3) \ncontrol\n 2; 4) 5-FU. The FdUMP[10] and 5FU studies were done consecutively (rather than concurrently) so that two control groups were required. Tumors from animals treated with FdUMP[10] displayed statistically significant reduced growth throughout the study while 5FU did not reduce tumor growth rates relative to control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n. (Top) Western blot demonstrating expression of PSMA in PSMA-transduced PC3 cells but not in mock-transfected PC3 cells or PC3 cells obtained from ATCC. (Bottom)—Confocal microscopy images demonstrating a lack of binding by both the J591 mAb and the dimeric aptamer complex to PSMA−PC3 cells (top panels). Significant surface binding is observed for both the dimeric aptamer complex and the mAb to the PSMA+PC3 cells (bottom panels).\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is explained in greater detail below.

Extracellular surface proteins of interest may be those “differentially expressed” by a targeted cell of interest, in comparison to a cell that is not to be targeted by a cytotoxic nucleotide. For example, the cancer cells differ from normal cells in many respects, including the up- or down-regulation of numerous genes. Among the genes that are differentially regulated in cancer cells are genes that encode proteins that are expressed on the extracellular surface. As an example, specific proteins are expressed on the extracellular surface of prostate cancer (PC) cells that are not expressed (or are expressed at very low levels) by normal prostatic epithelial cells and cells from other normal tissues. Extracellular proteins that are expressed exclusively by PC cells are excellent candidates for specific targeting of malignant cells with anticancer drugs. Cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) may be internalized by malignant cells that express specific ODN receptor proteins (Corrias et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 55: 1221-1227 (1998)). The expression of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is limited to PC cells and cells of the tumor neovasculature (Schulke et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 12590-12595 (2003)). A second protein that displays characteristics suitable for developing targeted therapeutics for PC is prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA; Saffran et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 2658-2663 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, extracellular proteins that form dimers are preferred. Examples include, but are not limited to, PSMA and transferrin receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, extracellular proteins that are associated with the development of tumor neovasculature are preferred. PSMA is a non-limiting example thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Viral disease” as used herein includes, but is not limited to, those caused by viruses belonging to the viral families including, but not limited to, Flaviviridae, Arenaviradae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Poxyiridae, Togaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Papovaviridae, Parvoviridae, Adenoviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Coronaviridae, Retroviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae.

Thus, the term “treat” refers to both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimes. Compounds generated by the methods of the present invention may be used for the diagnosis and/or treatment of human subjects, or animal subjects for veterinary or drug development purposes. Examples of animal subjects include mammalian (e.g., dog, cat, mouse, rat, horse, cow, pig, sheep, etc.), reptile, amphibian, and avian (e.g., parrot, budgie, chicken, turkey, duck, geese, quail, pheasant) subjects.\n\n\n \n2. ACTIVE COMPOUNDS\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, compounds (sometimes also referred to as “active compounds” herein) are compounds of the general formula A-B-C, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA is a first nucleic acid that specifically binds to an extracellular surface protein expressed by a cell of interest,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB is an alkyl linker; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC is a second nucleic acid that hybridizes to a complementary nucleic acid. Each of these is discussed in further detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. First nucleic acid. The first nucleic acid is, in general, selected to specifically bind to an extracellular surface protein expressed by a cell of interest. The first nucleic acid optionally but preferably contains cytotoxic nucleotides. Numerous such nucleic acids, including those sometimes referred to as “aptamers”, are known or can be identified in accordance with known techniques, such as described in William H. Gmeiner, Cytotoxic nucleotides for targeted therapeutics, US Patent Application 20080026947 (published Jan. 31, 2008). Other methods of identifying nucleic acids that can be used as the first nucleic acid herein include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,329,742; 7,312,325; 6,867,289; 6,858,390; and 6,369,208, or variations thereof that will be apparent to those skilled in the art given the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, an aptamer would be selected as a species of a nucleic acid pool, and then synthetically resynthesized in whole or in part to provide active compounds. As such, the elements of the aptamer will depend upon the features of the nucleic acid with the pool from which the aptamer is produced. In some embodiments, the size of the nucleic acids species within the pool can be in a range of about 30 nucleotides to about 150 nucleotides. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid species of the present invention comprises three regions: a “random” region flanked by two “constant” regions. It should be noted while the sequence in this region is random during the course of SELEX or other procedure to identify sequences that have the desired characteristics (e.g. binding to extracellular protein) these sequences are not random, but selected for in the course of practicing the invention. The two “constant” regions need not be identical to each other, but comprise known nucleotide sequences. These “constant” regions are used for the annealing of PCR primers during PCR amplification. The lengths of the “constant” regions can be in a range of about 8 nucleotides to about 35 nucleotides. In some embodiments the lengths of the “constant” regions are in a range of about 12 nucleotides to about 22 nucleotides. The length of the constant regions need not be the same as one another, and indeed each region may be modified in length and/or sequence based on folding predictions or results following the identification of optimal “random” regions. The “random” region of the nucleic acids species within the pool consists of random arrangements of nucleotide sequences. The length of the “random” region is not critical, but in general can be from 10 or 20 nucleotides in length up to 80 or 100 nucleotides in length, or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesizing a nucleic acid having a sequence corresponding to a selected nucleic acid and incorporating a compound of interest may done according to any method standard in the art including, but not limited to, de novo chemical synthesis of polynucleotides, such as by presently available automated DNA synthesizers, and standard phosphoramidite chemistry. De novo chemical synthesis of a polynucleotide can be conducted using any suitable method, including, but not limited to, the phosphotriester or phosphodiester methods. See Narang et al., \nMeth. Enzymol., \n68:90 (1979); U.S. Pat. No. 4,356,270; Itakura et al., \nAnn. Rev. Biochem., \n53:323-56 (1989); Brown et al., \nMeth. Enzymol., \n68:109 (1979); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,310 issued to Heller. In one embodiment of the present invention, automated nucleic acid synthesis is conducted using an Applied Biosystem 394™ automated DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Alkyl linkers. Alkyl linkers (also referred to as alkyl spacers) may for example be partially saturated or fully saturated C2-C6 or C10 alkyl groups, which can be linear or branched and may optionally contain one or more hetero atoms (e.g., one, two, three or four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S), as long as their is at least one alkyl bond, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, in the main chain between the two linked groups (though in some preferred embodiments, heteroatoms are excluded therefrom). Alkyl linkers include groups of the formula —X—Y—Z—, where X and Y may be present or absent; at least one of X, Y, and Z is an alkyl group of the formula —[CH\n2\n]\nn\n— where n is an integer of from 1, 2 or 3 up to 5 or 10; and otherwise each of X, Y, and Z can be selected from the group consisting of alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, etc. The linker may be of any suitable length, for example, 10, 20 or 50 Angstroms in length, up to 100, 200 or 500 Angstroms in length, or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlkyl linkers suitable for phosphoramidite synthesis of nucleic acids are known and available. A currently preferred example is 3-(4,4′-Dimethoxytrityloxy)propyl-1-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite, commercially available as Spacer Phosphoramidite C3 (Product No. 10-1913-xx) from Glen Research Corporation, 22825 Davis Drive, Sterling, Va. 20164 USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Second nucleic acid. The second nucleic acid (which optionally but preferably contains cytotoxic nucleotides) can be of any suitable length to provide hybridization to another nucleic acid, according to the well-known principles of Watson-Crick pairing. In general, the second nucleic acid can be of from 5 or 10 to 40 or 60 nucleotides in length, or more. Depending upon how the alkyl linker is synthesized in the molecule, the second nucleic acid can be continuously synthesized onto the growing polymer molecule in a continuous automated fashion, or synthesized separately and then covalently coupled to other portions of the molecule. Flexible linkers as described above can optionally be included in the second nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD. Additional features. To aid in detection, the at least one nucleic acid from the first subpopulation may be labeled with a detectable label using methods standard in the art, wherein the detectable label can include, but is not limited to, fluorescent dyes, fluorophores, chromophores, affinity labels, metal chelates, chemically reactive groups, enzymes, radionuclides, electrochemically detectable moieties, and energy absorbing or energy emitting compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescent dyes that can be used with the present invention are any capable of binding to nucleic acids as defined herein and include, but are not limited to, the coumarin dyes, acetyl azide, fluorescein isothiocyanate, 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 8-(6-aminohexyl)\namino adenosine\n 3′,5′-cyclicmonophosphate, bis(triethylammonium) salt, rhodamine dyes, sulfonyl chloride, CyDye™ flors, and carboxynaphtofluorescein. The haptenes that may be used for labeling include, but are not limited to, biotin, digoxigenin, and 2,4-dinitrophenyl. The haptenes require fluorescently-labeled antibodies or specific proteins for visualization/detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLabeling of nucleic acids with electrophore mass labels is described, for example, in Xu et al., J. Chromatography 764:95-102 (1997). Electrophores are compounds that can be detected with high sensitivity by electron capture mass spectrometry (EC-MS). Electrophore mass labels can be attached to a probe using chemistry that is well known in the art for reversibly modifying a nucleotide (e.g., well-known nucleotide synthesis chemistry teaches a variety of methods for attaching molecules to nucleotides as protecting groups). Electrophore mass labels are detected using a variety of well-known electron capture mass spectrometry devices. Further, techniques that may be used in the detection of electrophore mass labels include, for example, fast atomic bombardment mass spectrometry (See Koster et al., Biomedical Environ. Mass Spec. 14:111-116 (1987)); plasma desorption mass spectrometry; electrospray/ionspray (See Fenn et al., J. Phys. Chem. 88:4451-59 (1984), PCT Appln. No. WO 90/14148, Smith et al., Anal. Chem. 62:882-89 (1990)); and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (Hillenkamp et al. \nBiological Mass Spectrometry \n(Burlingame and McCloskey, eds.), Elsevier Science Pub., Amsterdam, pp. 49-60, 1990); Huth-Fehre et al., \nRapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, \n6:209-13 (1992)).

No. 6,979,548 issued to Ford et al.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for conjugation of detectable labels to nucleic acids are well known in the art, for example, Schubert et al., \nNucleic Acids Research \n18:3427 (1990) Smith et al., \nNature, \n321:674-679 (1986); Agarawal et al., \nNucleic Acids Research, \n14:6227-6245 (1986); Chu et al., \nNucleic Acids Research, \n16:3671-3691 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, modified oligonucleotides incorporate activated anticancer drugs into three-dimensional nucleic acid structures that selectively bind to and are internalized by cancer cells. Modified oligonucleotides are comprised, in part, of relatively low molecular weight activated drugs. Thus, the three-dimensional structures of modified oligonucleotides that facilitate selective binding to and penetration of targeted cells are formed based upon the chemical and structural properties of the component drugs or cytotoxic nucleotides. In preferred embodiments, the activated drug is 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-O-monophosphate (FdUMP).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncorporation of a compound of interest into a selected nucleic acid sequence requires that the selected nucleic acid sequence retains its original three-dimensional structure of the native sequence following the incorporation. In some embodiments, folding calculations are performed to compare the predicted folding patterns of the chemical structure of the native nucleic acid sequence with that of a nucleic acid sequence incorporating one or more compound of interest. Calculations can be performed with, e.g., folding programs such as mFOLD (Michael Zuker, Burnet Institute). Such calculations apply an algorithm to the native sequence of the nucleic acid to determine folding patterns that yield the most stable secondary structures. This approach provides insight into the likely location of double helical regions that occur within the three-dimensional structure of the nucleic acid. The structural characteristics of the native and modified nucleic acids can also be determined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and ultraviolet (UV) hyperchromicity measurements. Other methods of comparison will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Preferred nucleic acids of interest are those that incorporate compounds of interest in such a way as to not significantly alter the folding characteristics of the native sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, modified nucleic acids are further evaluated for the extent to which they selectively kill cells of interest, e.g., through the release of cytotoxic nucleotides by 3′-O-exonucleolytic degradation. Cell viability can be evaluated, e.g., using 3-(4,5-dimethylhiazole-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assays. Preferred nucleic acids are those that are cytotoxic towards cells of interest and not cytotoxic to non-targeted cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, a synthetic nucleic acid may comprise one compound of interest. In other embodiments, a synthetic nucleic acid may incorporate more than one compound of interest. In some embodiments, one of the compounds of interest incorporated into the synthetic nucleic acid may be a detectable compound, and/or an active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides are oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that contain one or more cytotoxic nucleoside analogs. Once incorporated into an ODN, the 5′-O-monophosphate form of the nucleoside is present as an intact unit that is embedded in the ODN polymer. The cytotoxic nucleoside analogs may be incorporated as a stretch of several ODNs, or may be incorporated at various places in the nucleotide species. In some embodiments, cytotoxic ODNs are arranged as a stretch of 2, 3, 4, or 5 to 20, 25, 30, or 40 ODNs. A preferred example of a cytotoxic ODN is FdUMP[10], a linear homopolymer of FdUMP, the thymidylate synthase inhibitory metabolite of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU). (Gmeiner, Curr. Med. Chem. 12: 1345-1359 (2005); Gmeiner et al., Nucl. Nuct. Nucl. Acids 23: 401-410 (2004)). Another preferred example is FdUMP[5]. The cytotoxic ODNs may be included in the synthesis of a desired nucleotide species, or may be appended to a desired nucleotide species. Synthesis and toxicity of FdUMP are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,457,187 (Gmeiner et al.); 5,614,505 (Gmeiner et al.); 5,663,321 (Gmeiner et al.); 5,741,900 (Gmeiner et al.); and 6,342,485 (Gmeiner).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, ODNs may be synthesized to incorporate compounds of interest such as cytotoxic nucleoside analogs, either before or after the enrichment selections of candidate ODN sequences. In a preferred embodiment, ODNs selected in the first and second pools do not comprise a compound of interest. The selected ODNs are sequenced and analyzed to determine whether the incorporation of a compound on interest will affect their activity towards a biological target of interest. Cytotoxic ODNs are then subsequently synthesized consistent with analysis predictions (e.g. predicted folding). However, synthesis of ODNs containing a compound on interest such as a cytotoxic nucleoside analog may also be performed prior to the enrichment steps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified ODNs of the present invention can be optimized, e.g., for treatment of PC and other malignancies. In some embodiments of the present invention, the modified ODNs target xPSM using FdUMP as the active drug. In other embodiments, the modified ODNs target extracellular surface proteins that are differentially expressed specifically on the surface of certain PC cells (e.g. prostate stem cell antigen). In further embodiments the modified ODNs administered to a particular patient may be customized to reflect the protein profile expressed by a specific patient. Additionally, the choice of drugs for inclusion into the modified ODN structure may be expanded to reflect the drug-profile that provides the maximum response for a particular malignancy. The ODNs of the present invention are compatible with a wide-range of cytotoxic compounds, including, but not limited to, nucleoside analogs, cytotoxic drugs, radionuclides, modifiers of gene expression and nanoparticles.\n\n\n \n3. COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nInitially, a pair of active compounds of the present invention, as described above, are hybridized to one another in accordance with well-known techniques (e.g., simply mixing together in an aqueous solution, or annealing by gentle heating and cooling in accordance with known techniques) to produce a hybridized composition. They hybridized composition is, for convenience, sometimes also referred to as an “active compound” herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds described above may be formulated for administration in a pharmaceutical carrier in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., Remington, \nThe Science And Practice of Pharmacy \n(9\nth \nEd. 1995). In the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention, the active compound (including the physiologically acceptable salts thereof) is typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a tablet, which may contain from 0.01 or 0.5% to 95% or 99% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy comprising admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces) and transdermal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound which is being used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more accessory ingredients as noted above). In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the active compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid binder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising the active compound in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injection solutions of the active compound(s), which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit\\dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. For example, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile composition comprising an active compound(s), or a salt thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid composition suitable for injection thereof into a subject. The unit dosage form typically comprises from about 10 mg to about 10 grams of the compound or salt. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent which is physiologically acceptable may be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which may be used include petroleum jelly, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, transdermal enhancers, and combinations of two or more thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis (see, for example, \nPharmaceutical Research \n3 (6):318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Suitable formulations comprise citrate or bis\\tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol/water and contain from 0.1 to 0.2M active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the present invention provides liposomal formulations of the compounds disclosed herein and salts thereof. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound or salt thereof is an aqueous-soluble salt, using conventional liposome technology, the same may be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the compound or salt, the compound or salt will be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed may be of any conventional composition and may either contain cholesterol or may be cholesterol-free. When the compound or salt of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the salt may be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer which forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes which are produced may be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf course, the liposomal formulations containing the compounds disclosed herein or salts thereof, may be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which may be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared from the water-insoluble compounds disclosed herein, or salts thereof, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such an instance, the composition will contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the compound or salt thereof. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines, and lecithin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to active compound(s), the pharmaceutical compositions may contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the compositions may contain microbial preservatives. Useful microbial preservatives include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. The microbial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multidose use. Of course, as indicated, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\n \n4. USE\n\n\n \n \n \nAs noted above, compounds of the present invention may be used to detect and/or selectively kill or inhibit the growth of cells of interest, including but not limited to cancer cells, tissue cells generally (e.g., muscle, bone, nerve, liver, lung, etc.), pathological and non-pathological microbial cells (e.g., bacterial, mycobacterial, spirochetal rickettsial, chlamydial, mycoplasmal, and fungal, etc.), parasitic cells (e.g., protozoal, helminth, etc.), and plant cells, etc. Such methods may be carried out in vitro or in vivo (e.g., by administering the compound to a plant or animal host carrying or harboring undesired cells of interest, such as cancer cells, pathological microbial cells, parasitic cells, etc.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention may also be used to control, e.g., kill or inhibit the growth of, microbes that may otherwise contaminate an industrial fermentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, compounds of the present invention may be used as an herbicide. The compounds of the present invention may be applied to the surface of the plant including, but not limited to, leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, roots, cells or callus tissue. Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be introduced into the plant via methods standard in the art including, but not limited to, microinjection, electroporation, particle bombardment, and \nAgrobacterium\n-mediated transformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, compounds of the present invention may also be used for treatment of infection of plants and plant cells by plant pathogens, the plant pathogens including, but not limited to, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, viruses, and nematodes. For the purpose of treatment of plant pathogenic infections, the compounds of the present invention may be applied to the surface of a plant including, but not limited to, leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, roots, cells or callus tissue. Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be introduced into the plant via methods standard in the art including, but not limited to, microinjection, electroporation, particle bombardment, and \nAgrobacterium\n-mediated transformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically effective dosage of any specific compound, the use of which is in the scope of present invention, will vary somewhat from compound to compound, and patient to patient, and will depend upon the condition of the patient and the route of delivery. As a general proposition, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg will have therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments, a dosage from about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg may be employed for oral administration. In some embodiments, a dosage from about 0.5 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg may be employed for intramuscular injection. For agricultural use, the compounds may be applied to plants or crops by any suitable technique, such as by spraying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is explained in greater detail in the following non-limiting Examples.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nDeveloping DNA Aptamers to PSMA. We have has formed an affinity matrix using recombinant PSMA expressed from baculovirus. This affinity matrix has been used in completion of two SELEX procedures to identify novel DNA aptamers to PSMA. These are the first DNA aptamers to PSMA that we are aware of. We contracted with Kinakeet Biotechnology (Richmond, Va.) to express the 706 amino acids comprising the extracellular domain of PSMA from Sf9 cells using baculovirus. RNA was extracted from pelleted LNCaP cells and primers were designed for cloning of the extracellular domain of PSMA from the corresponding cDNA. The accuracy of all cloning steps was verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Protein purity was determined by gel electrophoresis and the identity of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting and mass spectrometry. The recombinant PSMA includes a His-tag that was used for attachment of the recombinant protein to Dynabeads Talon (Dynal Biotech) for use as an affinity matrix for aptamer selection. The suitability of the affinity matrix for DNA aptamer selection was verified by demonstrating that the A10-3 RNA aptamer to PSMA bound the affinity matrix. SELEX methodology was used to identify DNA aptamers to PSMA. The DNA library used for SELEX included a 45 nucleotide random sequence flanked by two 21 nucleotide fixed regions. The ssDNA was converted to dsDNA using a series of “fill-in” reactions with T7 DNA polymerase. These “fill-in” reactions were each run on a 2 μg scale. The resulting dsDNA was amplified using multiplex PCR to create 20-30 μg of dsDNA. PCR was done using a primer to the original ssDNA that was 5′-phosphorylated. Following amplification, the dsDNA was converted to ssDNA using exonuclease λ. The ssDNA product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and quantified by UV absorption. Typically 5-10 μg ssDNA were used for binding reactions for SELEX. The ssDNA was incubated with the PSMA affinity matrix for 60 min at 37° C. The supernatant was removed, and bound material was eluted from the affinity matrix by heating to 90° C. ssDNA was converted to dsDNA, PCR amplified, converted back to ssDNA and repeated rounds of forward and counter SELEX were performed to create a DNA pool enriched in sequences that bound with high affinity to PSMA. The resulting DNA was cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega) which was then used to transform competent BL21 \nE. coli \ncells. DNA sequences were determined from individual clones at the core DNA sequencing facility of the CCCWFU. The initial SELEX procedure resulted in identification of 10 DNA sequences—several of which were chemically synthesized and shown to bind selectively to recombinant PSMA (BSA as the negative control) using fluorescence anisotropy. These sequences were also shown using fluorescence microscopy to bind selectively to PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, C4-2) relative to PC3 cells. While we had identified DNA aptamers that were suitable for the next stage of Cytotoxamer development, a few of our experiments using scrambled sequences as negative controls had ambiguous results. Further, while we consistently observed surface binding to PSMA-expressing cells by fluorescence microscopy, we observed little evidence for cellular internalization. Somewhat surprisingly, only surface binding was also observed with the A10 RNA aptamer that was reported to be internalized into PSMA-expressing cells by other research groups (Lupold et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2006). We thus decided to repeat the SELEX procedure. The second SELEX procedure used different primer sequences, but was otherwise undertaken using identical methodology. Sequencing of 10 clones from this procedure resulted in nine of the clones having a single sequence indicating the final DNA pool was highly enriched in this sequence which we termed PSMA01. The sequence of PSMA01 is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-GCGTTTTCGCTTTTGCGTTTTGGGTCATCTGCTTACGATAGCAATCGT\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies with the PSMA01 DNA aptamer verified that this sequence selectively binds to PSMA-expressing cells and has no affinity for cells that do not express PSMA (\nFIG. 1\n). In these studies, live (non-fixed cells) cells were incubated in the presence of fluorescently-labeled aptamer for 2 h at room temperature. In these studies, C4-2 and LNCaP cells were used to evaluate binding to PSMA+ cells while PC3 cells were used as a PSMA− negative control. The PSMA01 DNA aptamer that we identified in our laboratory displayed selective binding to PSMA+C4-2 and LNCaP cells and displayed no binding to PSMA−PC3 cells. The binding of PSMA-01 was similar to the A10-3 RNA aptamer that had been previously described. Neither our PSMA-01 DNA aptamer nor the A10-3 aptamer were internalized into PSMA+ cells to any significant extent under any of the conditions analyzed (incubation at room temperature or 37° C.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDimeric Aptamer Complexes Show Enhanced Cellular Internalization: At this time, we obtained a sample of the J591 mAb to PSMA (kindly provided by Dr. Neil Bander, Cornell-Weill Medical School). During the course of studies with J591, it became clear that the mAb not only had somewhat greater surface binding to PSMA-expressing cells relative to PSMA01 (and other aptamers, both DNA aptamers developed in our laboratory and RNA aptamers that had been previously described), but J591 was also more efficiently internalized into PSMA-expressing cells. In contemplating the physical basis for the increased binding and internalization of the J591 antibody relative to the monomeric aptamer conjugates, we focused on the bivalent structure of the mAb as likely contributing significantly to the observed more favorable binding and cellular internalization characteristics of the mAb. We designed bivalent dimeric aptamer complexes that were formed through Watson-Crick base pairing (\nFIG. 2\n). Initial constructs used homopolymeric dA and dT tails since this strategy readily permits rendering these dimeric aptamer complexes potentially cytotoxic through T→FdU substitution. The tails were designed to form a 16 base pair linker sequence that would be stable at 37° C. but not be so stable as to inhibit nuclease degradation following cellular internalization. Although this linker is probably not of optimal geometry, the dimeric aptamer complex displayed greater surface binding and fluorescence microscopy images were consistent with increased cellular internalization relative to the monomeric aptamer conjugates (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConfocal Microcopy Demonstrates Enhanced Cell Internalization of Dimeric Aptamer Complexes: The cellular internalization of dimeric aptamer complexes was further investigated using confocal microscopy. For these studies, both component monomeric aptamer conjugates were fluorescently labeled. PSMA01-dA16 was labeled with Quasar 670 and PSMA01-dT16 was labeled with Quasar 570. These long wavelength dyes are resistant to bleaching and have minimal spectral overlap permitting simultaneous scanning of these two wavelengths to demonstrate through co-localization studies to what extent the dimer structure was formed and whether the aptamer remained in dimeric form while bound to the cell surface and following cellular internalization. Representative images are shown in \nFIG. 4\n. The data confirmed co-localization of the Quasar 570 and Quasar 670 dyes indicating that the aptamer complexes bound as dimers. The images indicated cellular internalization and retention of the dimeric complexes within endocytic vesicles. The two dyes co-localized in endocytic vesicles, as well, consistent with the aptamer complex remaining in dimeric form following cellular internalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased Flexibility Enhances Cellular Uptake of Dimeric Aptamer Complexes: While the linker domain consisting of 16 Watson-Crick base pairs was stable at 37° C. and conferred an advantage in terms of cellular binding and internalization relative to the monomeric aptamer conjugates, we reasoned that additional binding avidity of the dimeric aptamer complex for PSMA could be conferred by including one or more alkyl linkers into the structure. Alkyl linkers are highly flexible, with flexibility that surpasses the deoxyribonucleotide components of the dsDNA that composes the linker sequence (\nFIG. 5\n). We reasoned that this increased flexibility would allow each component aptamer to adopt an optimal conformation for binding to PSMA with minimal penalty in terms of free energy associated with structural distortion. Preliminary studies are promising, with dimeric aptamer complexes including one alkyl linker between the PSMA01 aptamer and the tail (either dA16 or dT16) showing enhanced cellular binding and internalization relative to dimeric aptamer complexes that do not include an alkyl linker (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative binding of the PSMA01 DNA aptamer in monomeric form as well as in dimeric form with and without flexible linkers was also evaluated towards C4-2 cells using flow cytometry. The results are summarized in \nFIG. 6\n. Cells were treated in the same manner as described for the confocal microscopy experiments and were detached using an enzyme-free cell-dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto flow cytometry system and the data were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and Efficacy of FdUMP[10] Towards Prostate Cancer Xenografts: The principal strategy that will be used to render the dimeric aptamer complexes we have developed selectively cytotoxic towards targeted cancer cells is to include cytotoxic nucleotides, such as FdU, in the structure. While other modalities may also be included to render these modified aptamers cytotoxic to cancer cells (e.g. siRNA, toxins), there is considerable merit to the concept that dimeric aptamer complexes are the best method for delivery of FdU and other cytotoxic nucleotide analogs in the future. In principle, delivery of cytotoxic nucleotide analogs in aptamers increases the selectivity and potency of these drugs while minimizing systemic toxicities. In this regard, it is important to consider the advantages obtained by inclusion of FdU in single-stranded DNA (e.g. FdUMP[10]) relative to delivery as the nucleobase (5FU). We have shown that not only does delivery of fluoropyrimidine (FP) as FdUMP[10] increase efficacy and decrease toxicity, it also changes the spectrum of malignancies that are responsive to FP treatment. Recent unpublished data from our laboratory has demonstrated that FdUMP[10] is efficacious towards PC3 xenografts, a model of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (\nFIG. 7\n). PSMA, the target for the dimeric aptamer complexes being developed by us, is frequently expressed in advanced prostate cancer. PSMA is also frequently expressed in tumor neovasculature. As FPs are widely used for treatment of solid tumors, the dimeric aptamer complexes developed in these studies should provide an improved mechanism for tumor-specific delivery of FPs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe recently completed an in vivo xenograft study evaluating the anti-tumor activity of FdUMP[10] and 5FU towards PC3 xenografts (\nFIG. 8\n). All groups had comparable size tumors at baseline. FdUMP[10] (150 mg/kg) was injected i.v. 1× per week via jugular vein catheter. 5FU (100 mg/kg) was also injected 1× per week by the same route. The dose of 5FU administered was the maximum tolerated dose and 5FU-treated animals lost weight compared to the controls. FdUMP[10] was well-tolerated at the administered dose. A mixed effects model was fit to examine whether there were differences between groups over the first 44 days after administration of FdUMP[10] or 5FU. In this model, individual animals were considered as random effects and the group and day variables were considered as fixed effects. The FdUMP[10]-treated mice displayed significantly reduced tumor growth relative to control beginning on day 18 of treatment and persisting for all subsequent time points (p<0.0003 (day 30)). We expect that with dimeric aptamer complexes including FdU, we will further increase the selectivity for malignant cells and further reduce systemic toxicities. Thus, dimeric aptamer complexes may ultimately become the preferred method for administering fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in the era of molecularly targeted cancer therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe plan to conduct clonogenic assays with dimeric aptamer complexes containing FdU in a matched pair of PC3 cells (PSMA+ and PSMA−). These cells were provided by Dr. W. D. Heston (Cleveland Clinic). Since these cells differ only in PSMA expression, differences in cytotoxicity can be attributed directly to PSMA-mediated endocytosis of dimeric aptamer complexes. PC3 cells also have mutant p53 while C4-2 cells have wtp53. Ongoing studies from our laboratory show that PC3 cells are more sensitive to activated FPs (e.g. FdUMP[10] than C4-2 cells and that the relative cytotoxicity difference can be reduced either by shRNA knockdown of p53 in C4-2 cells or viral transduction of wtp53 into PC3 cells. As p53 mutations are among the most frequent mutation in cancer and that mutated p53 generally makes tumors less responsive to chemotherapy, these finding bode well for the future clinical use of activated FPs, and especially dimeric aptamer complexes containing FdU, for molecularly-targeted chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective Uptake Into PC3 PSMA+/− cells. We have evaluated the selective binding and uptake of our dimeric aptamer complexes using in a matched pair of PC3 cells (PSMA+ and PSMA−). These cells were provided by Dr. W. D. Heston (Cleveland Clinic). Since these cells differ only in PSMA expression, differences in surface binding and internalization can be attributed directly to PSMA-mediated processes. Western blots confirmed PSMA expression selectively in the PSMA-transduced PC3 cells (\nFIG. 8\n). Representative confocal images demonstrating PSMA-specific binding are also shown in \nFIG. 8\n. Neither the J591 mAb nor the dimeric aptamer complex displayed either surface binding or internalization into the PSMA−PC3 cells. Both the mAb and the dimeric aptamer complex, however, displayed considerable surface binding upon incubation with the PSMA+ PC3 cells at 4° C. and considerable internalized signal was evident upon incubation at 37° C. When incubation proceeds at 4° C., clustered signal, or surface “patching” is observed for both the J591 mAb and the dimeric aptamer complex. This surface “patching” (Hopwood et al., 1982) is observed over the Golgi apparatus in PSMA+ PC3 cells. Patching is characteristic of multivalent ligands and facilitates endocytosis. Both the dimeric aptamer complex and the mAb are present in internalized vesicles in PSMA+ PC3 cells following incubation at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing is illustrative of the present invention, and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein."

Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl coenzyme A in vivo via the mevalonic acid pathway via 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (hereinafter also referred to as HMGCoA), mevalonic acid (hereinafter also referred to as MVA), and the like. Since the conversion of HMGCoA to MVA by hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase is the rate-limiting step in this mevalonate pathway, the amount of cholesterol synthesis in vivo can be estimated by measuring the amount of mevalonate (non-patent literature) 1).

The enzyme cycling method is derived from the measurement target A by an enzyme cycling reaction through hydrogen acceptor X and hydrogen donor Y (where hydrogen donor Y and reduced hydrogen acceptor X are not the same substance). Is a method of amplifying the signal. The outline of the enzyme cycling method is as follows: \n \n \n \n And reaction 4: \n \n \n \n It is expressed using a combination of Here, A is a measurement target, and the hydrogen donor Y and the reduced hydrogen acceptor X are not the same substance, and an enzyme that catalyzes Reaction Formula 3 and Reaction Formula 4 to a test solution containing the measurement target A, Hydrogen acceptor X and hydrogen donor Y are added to carry out the above enzyme reaction. Measured object A is cycled between A and A (oxide) during the reaction, and reduced hydrogen acceptor X and oxidized hydrogen donor Y are generated according to the number of cycles. Measured by colorimetric measurement of the amount of reduced hydrogen acceptor X or the amount of oxidized hydrogen donor Y or the amount of reduced hydrogen acceptor X or the amount of reduced hydrogen donor Y High-sensitivity measurement of object A can be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　一般に、酵素サイクリング反応において反応液中に加える酵素量を増加させると、単位時間当たりの酵素サイクリング反応の回数が増加して感度が上がるが：1)反応に関与する酵素の反応速度定数kcat；2)反応液に溶解することができる酵素の量；3)用いる酵素の純度；などにより、一定量以上の酵素を反応液に添加することは不可能であるか測定感度の向上に効果が無い。したがって、酵素サイクリング反応において、測定可能な測定対象濃度の下限値が存在する。上記の酵素サイクリング法において、水素受容体Xが酸化型チオニコチンアミドアデニンジヌクレオチド(以下、T-NADともいう)または酸化型チオニコチンアミドアデニンジヌクレオチドリン酸(以下、T-NADPともいう)であり、水素供与体Yが還元型ニコチンアミドアデニンジヌクレオチド(以下、NADHともいう)または還元型ニコチンアミドアデニンジヌクレオチドリン酸(以下、NADPHともいう)であるとき、測定対象について測定可能な濃度の下限値は、通常1～10μM程度であった(特許文献1、特許文献2、非特許文献7、非特許文献8)。\n\n\nIn general, increasing the amount of enzyme added to the reaction solution in the enzyme cycling reaction increases the number of enzyme cycling reactions per unit time and increases the sensitivity: 1) Reaction rate constant kcat of the enzyme involved in the reaction; 2 It is impossible to add a certain amount or more of enzyme to the reaction solution depending on the amount of the enzyme that can be dissolved in the reaction solution; 3) the purity of the enzyme used; Therefore, in the enzyme cycling reaction, there is a lower limit value of the concentration to be measured that can be measured. In the above enzyme cycling method, the hydrogen acceptor X is oxidized thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (hereinafter also referred to as T-NAD) or oxidized thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (hereinafter also referred to as T-NADP). Yes, when the hydrogen donor Y is reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (hereinafter also referred to as NADH) or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (hereinafter also referred to as NADPH), the concentration of the measurement target is measurable. The lower limit was usually about 1 to 10 μM (\nPatent Document\n 1, Patent Document 2, Non-Patent \nDocument\n 7, Non-Patent Document 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　酵素サイクリング法を用いた、より高感度な測定方法における測定可能な濃度の下限値の例として：測定対象Aがコール酸、酵素サイクリング反応を触媒する酵素が3α-ステロイドデヒドロゲナーゼである場合の下限値は0.2μM(特許文献3)；測定対象Aがグルコース-6-リン酸、酵素サイクリング反応を触媒する酵素がグルコース-6-リン酸デヒドロゲナーゼである場合の下限値は0.2μM(特許文献4)；測定対象Aがコレステロール、酵素サイクリング反応を触媒する酵素がコレステロールデヒドロゲナーゼである場合の下限値0.1μM(非特許文献9)であった。また、水素受容体Xが酸素、水素供与体YがNADHまたは還元型NADPHである場合、リゾフォスファチジン酸をリゾフォスファチジン酸リパーゼで分解して得られるグリセロール-3-リン酸を測定対象として、グリセロール-3-リン酸オキシダーゼ、グリセロール-3-リン酸デヒドロゲナーゼをサイクリング反応の酵素として用いて、還元型水素受容体Xである過酸化水素をパーオキシダーゼ、4-アミノアンチピリン、TOOSを用いて検出することで、0.03μMの下限値まで測定可能であった(非特許文献10)。\n\n\nAs an example of the lower limit of measurable concentration in a more sensitive measurement method using the enzyme cycling method: Lower limit when the measurement target A is cholic acid and the enzyme that catalyzes the enzyme cycling reaction is 3α-steroid dehydrogenase 0.2 μM (Patent Document 3); the lower limit when the measurement target A is glucose-6-phosphate and the enzyme that catalyzes the enzyme cycling reaction is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is 0.2 μM (Patent Document 4); The lower limit value was 0.1 μM (non-patent document 9) when the measurement target A was cholesterol and the enzyme that catalyzes the enzyme cycling reaction was cholesterol dehydrogenase. In addition, when hydrogen acceptor X is oxygen and hydrogen donor Y is NADH or reduced NADPH, glycerol-3-phosphate obtained by decomposing lysophosphatidic acid with lysophosphatidic acid lipase is measured. As a cycling reaction, glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are used, and hydrogen peroxide that is reduced hydrogen acceptor X is used with peroxidase, 4-aminoantipyrine, and TOOS. By detecting, it was possible to measure up to the lower limit of 0.03 μM (Non-patent Document 10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　特に、水素受容体XがT-NADまたはT-NADP、水素供与体YがNADHまたはNADPHである場合の酵素サイクリング反応としては、例えば：測定対象Aに対するデヒドロゲナーゼを用いた、以下の反応式5：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nおよび反応式6：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nの組み合わせによる反応(特許文献1、特許文献3、特許文献4、非特許文献7、非特許文献8)；測定対象がグルタミン酸もしくはα-ケトグルタル酸またはアンモニアであり、これらに対するグルタミン酸デヒドロゲナーゼを用いた、反応式7：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nおよび反応式8：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nの組み合わせによる反応(特許文献2)；あるいは測定対象がD-グリセロアルデヒド-3-リン酸、無機リン、または1,3-ジホスホグリセリン酸であり、これらに対しD-グリセロアルデヒド-3-リン酸デヒドロゲナーゼを用いた反応式9：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nおよび反応式10：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nの組み合わせによる反応(特許文献５)等が知られていた。そして、特許文献2においては、塩化アンモニウム測定の下限値として40μM、L-グルタミン酸測定の下限値として40μM、グルタミン酸デヒドロゲナーゼの代わりにロイシンデヒドロゲナーゼを用い、反応式7および反応式8においてグルタミン酸をロイシンに、α-ケトグルタル酸を2-オキソイソカプロエイトに変更した酵素サイクリング反応におけるL-ロイシンの測定の下限値として4μMが報告されていた。特許文献4においては、リン酸測定の下限値として10μM、3-ホスホグリセリン酸キナーゼを用いて3-ホスホグリセリン酸を1,3-ジホスホグリセリン酸に変換した後に測定した下限値として0.2μMが報告されていた。\n\nIn particular, as the enzyme cycling reaction when the hydrogen acceptor X is T-NAD or T-NADP and the hydrogen donor Y is NADH or NADPH, for example: the following \nreaction formula\n 5 using dehydrogenase for the measurement target A: \n \n \n \n \n And Reaction Scheme 6: \n \n \n \n \n (\nPatent Document\n 1, Patent Document 3, Patent Document 4, Non-Patent \nDocument\n 7, Non-Patent Document 8); the measurement object is glutamic acid or α-ketoglutaric acid or ammonia, and glutamic acid dehydrogenase for these is used, Reaction formula 7: \n \n \n \n \n And Scheme 8: \n \n \n \n \n (Patent Document 2); or the measurement object is D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, inorganic phosphorus, or 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, and D-glyceroaldehyde-3-\nphosphorus Reaction formula\n 9 using acid dehydrogenase: \n \n \n \n \n And Scheme 10: \n \n \n \n \n The reaction by the combination of (patent document 5) etc. was known.

Since it is necessary, and the measurement method using an antibody utilizes an antigen-antibody reaction, it cannot be said that it is a method that can process a large number of specimens and perform measurement with high sensitivity and high accuracy simply. Similar to MVA, HMGCoA, which is considered to be important as an indicator of cholesterol metabolism in vivo, and CoA, which is considered to be important as an indicator of lipid metabolism in vivo, can process multiple samples, and can be used easily and easily. A method capable of measuring with high sensitivity and high accuracy has not been known so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、酵素サイクリング法を用いても、被検液中の測定対象物質の検出限界はこれまでの報告から0.03μM程度であると考えられ、被検液中の測定対象物質の濃度が30nMより低濃度の場合、例えば20nM、10nM、1nM、0.5nM、0.25nM等の場合には、酵素サイクリング法を用いても高感度で高精度な測定はできなかった。特に、水素受容体XがT-NADまたはT-NADP、水素供与体YがNADHまたはNADPHであり、反応式5および反応式6の組み合わせによる酵素サイクリング反応において、被検液中の測定対象物質の濃度が100nMより低濃度の場合、例えば50nM、25nM、20nM、10nM、1nM、0.5nM、0.25nM等の場合に、高感度で高精度な測定はできなかった。\n\n\nEven with the enzyme cycling method, the detection limit of the measurement target substance in the test solution is considered to be about 0.03 μM from previous reports, and the concentration of the measurement target substance in the test liquid is lower than 30 nM. In the case of concentration, for example, 20 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.25 nM, etc., high-sensitivity and high-accuracy measurement could not be performed even using the enzyme cycling method.

For example, when the reduced hydrogen acceptor X is T-NADH or T-NADPH, a method by colorimetric analysis at an absorbance at a wavelength of 380 to 430 nm is desirable. In the present specification, “colorimetric analysis” is also referred to as absorption spectrometry or absorptiometry, and the absorbance is obtained by transmitting light having a specific wavelength (for example, light having a wavelength of 340 ± 5 nm) through the solution to be measured.

For example, when the measurement target in the test solution is MVA and / or HMGCoA, the concentration of MVA and / or HMGCoA in the test solution is not less than the minimum detection limit concentration and is 1000 nM or less, preferably 500 nM or less.

In addition, D, L-MVA can also be used here, but when expressed in terms of D, L-MVA concentration, the concentration is about twice the MVA concentration, which is an index used in the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、本発明の測定方法においては、被検液中の測定対象の超高感度および高精度な濃度測定が可能となるため、被検液中の測定対象がCoAである場合、被検液中のCoAの濃度は、最小検出限界濃度以上であって、10μM以下、好ましくは5000nM以下、より好ましくは1000nM以下、さらに好ましくは500nM以下であり、被検液中の最小検出限界濃度は100nM以下、好ましくは50nM以下である。なお、ここで言う最小検出限界濃度とは、いくつかの濃度系列の被検液を複数回測定したときの測定値の平均値±3SDの範囲が、濃度0の被検液を同じく測定したとき測定値の平均値±3SDの範囲と交差しない最小の濃度をあらわすものとする。\n\n\nFurther, in the measurement method of the present invention, it becomes possible to measure the concentration of the measurement target in the test liquid with ultra-high sensitivity and high accuracy.

It shall represent the minimum concentration that does not cross the range of the mean value ± 3SD of the measured values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明に係る測定方法において、被検液中の測定対象がMVAまたはHMGCoAであって、被検液中にMVAおよびHMGCoAの両物質が存在する場合、測定により、両物質の和の濃度が得られ、MVAまたはHMGCoAのいずれかのみの濃度は得られない。そこで、被検液中にMVAおよびHMGCoAの両物質が存在する場合であって、HMGCoAのみの濃度を測定しようとする際には、1)被検液中のHMGCoAを除去したサンプルと除去しないサンプルの2つを準備し、それぞれのサンプルに反応式1および反応式2の反応を触媒する酵素を作用させ、それらの測定量の差から被検液中のHMGCoAを算出する、または2)被検液に反応式1および反応式2の反応を触媒する酵素を作用させる工程に先立って、被検液中のMVAを除く工程を行うことが望ましい。上記1)については後述する被検液中のHMGCoAを除く工程を用いて被検液のHMGCoAを除去したサンプルを準備して行うことができる。上記2)について、被検液中のMVAを除く工程は、測定対象であるHMGCoAを除くことなく行うことができれば特に制限されず、例えば、MVA特異的な吸着剤や選択的な膜によって被検液を処理する方法や、MVAを反応式1に関与しないような物質に変換する方法を用いることができる。MVAを反応式1に関与しないような物質に変換する方法としては例えば酵素反応を用いる方法が挙げられる。酵素を用いて、例えば以下の反応式21：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n記載のようにATPのようなリン酸供与体およびマグネシイムイオンまたはマンガンイオンの存在下、MVAを、反応式1に関与しないメバロン酸リン酸に変換することができる。該酵素の例として、例えばメバロン酸キナーゼ(EC2.7.1.36：以下、MVKともいう)が挙げられる。酵素反応によってMVAを除く工程において、反応液のpH、緩衝液、塩濃度等を最適になるように変化させることができる。また、必要に応じ、反応式21の生成物であるメバロン酸リン酸をさらにリン酸化するホスホメバロン酸キナーゼ(EC2.7.4.2)の添加、ADPを除去する目的でのホスホエノールピルビン酸とピルビン酸キナーゼの添加、またはグルコースとADP依存ヘキソキナーゼの添加を行うことができる。\n\nIn the measurement method according to the present invention, when the measurement target in the test solution is MVA or HMGCoA and both the MVA and HMGCoA substances are present in the test solution, the concentration of both substances is obtained by the measurement. Concentration of either MVA or HMGCoA is not obtained. Therefore, when both the MVA and HMGCoA substances are present in the test solution, and when trying to measure the concentration of only HMGCoA, 1) the sample with and without the removal of HMGCoA in the test solution Prepare the two samples, and let each sample react with the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of \nreaction formula\n 1 and reaction formula 2, and calculate the HMGCoA in the test solution from the difference between the measured amounts, or 2) Prior to the step of allowing the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of \nReaction Formula\n 1 and Reaction Formula 2 to act on the solution, it is desirable to perform a step of removing MVA in the test solution. The above 1) can be carried out by preparing a sample from which the HMGCoA in the test liquid has been removed using a process for removing HMGCoA in the test liquid described later. Regarding the above 2), the step of removing MVA in the test solution is not particularly limited as long as it can be performed without removing HMGCoA as a measurement target. For example, the test is performed using an MVA-specific adsorbent or a selective membrane. A method of treating the liquid or a method of converting MVA into a substance that does not participate in \nReaction Scheme\n 1 can be used. Examples of a method for converting MVA into a substance that does not participate in \nReaction Formula\n 1 include a method using an enzyme reaction. Using enzymes, for example, the following reaction formula 21: \n \n \n \n \n MVA can be converted to mevalonate phosphate not involved in \nReaction Scheme\n 1 in the presence of a phosphate donor such as ATP and magnecime ions or manganese ions as described. Examples of the enzyme include mevalonate kinase (EC2.7.1.36: hereinafter also referred to as MVK). In the step of removing MVA by enzymatic reaction, the pH, buffer solution, salt concentration, etc. of the reaction solution can be changed to be optimal. If necessary, add phosphomevalonate kinase (EC2.7.4.2) to further phosphorylate mevalonate phosphate, the product of reaction formula 21, and remove phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate for the purpose of removing ADP. Addition of kinase or addition of glucose and ADP-dependent hexokinase can be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　上述のように、酵素(例えばMVK)反応を用いて被検液中のMVAを除く工程の後、そのまま反応式1および反応式2の組み合わせによる酵素サイクリング反応に供すると、反応式2によってHMGCoAから変換されたMVAに前記酵素(例えばMVK)が作用することになる。したがって、酵素反応を用いて被検液からMVAを除く工程の後、用いた酵素を取り除くか、または酵素の反応を停止させることが望ましい。例えば、膜を用いた限外ろ過によって、酵素を取り除くことができ、酵素がMVKである場合、例えば分画分子量5000～30000の膜を用いて限外ろ過することで、HMGCoAを除くことなくMVKを除くことができる。また、酵素の反応を停止させるには、加熱処理、酸処理、アルカリ処理、酵素失活物質の添加など、HMGCoAを分解することなく所望の酵素を失活させる方法、所望の酵素(例えばMVK)の活性を阻害するが、反応式1および2の反応を触媒する酵素(例えば、HMGR)の活性を阻害しない物質を反応液に加える方法などを用いることができる。例えば、MVKの反応を阻害するがHMGRの酵素サイクリング反応を阻害しない物質として、マグネシウムイオンをキレートするキレート剤(例えばEDTA、EGTA、NTAなど)が挙げられる。上記の酵素を取り除くか、または酵素の反応を停止させる方法のうち、アルカリ処理による方法およびキレート剤を添加する方法は、分離操作を必要とせず、自動分析機において同一反応槽で一連の操作を行うことができるため好ましい。ここで、分離操作とは、被検液中のHMGCoAを測定する一連の工程の過程で行われる、カラムクロマトグラフィー操作、膜ろ過操作、吸着分離操作、抽出分離操作、沈殿分離操作などをいう。\n\n\nAs described above, after the step of removing MVA in the test solution using an enzyme (for example, MVK) reaction, if subjected to the enzyme cycling reaction by the combination of \nreaction formula\n 1 and reaction formula 2 as it is, the reaction formula 2 from HMGCoA The enzyme (for example, MVK) acts on the converted MVA. Therefore, it is desirable to remove the used enzyme or stop the enzyme reaction after the step of removing MVA from the test solution using the enzyme reaction. For example, the enzyme can be removed by ultrafiltration using a membrane. When the enzyme is MVK, for example, by performing ultrafiltration using a membrane having a molecular weight cut off of 5000 to 30000, the MVK can be obtained without removing HMGCoA. Can be excluded. In order to stop the reaction of the enzyme, a method of inactivating the desired enzyme without decomposing HMGCoA, such as heat treatment, acid treatment, alkali treatment, addition of an enzyme deactivating substance, the desired enzyme (for example, MVK) For example, a method of adding a substance that inhibits the activity of the reaction, but does not inhibit the activity of an enzyme (for example, HMGR) that catalyzes the reaction of \nreaction formulas\n 1 and 2 to the reaction solution can be used. For example, as a substance that inhibits the MVK reaction but does not inhibit the HMGR enzyme cycling reaction, a chelating agent that chelates magnesium ions (for example, EDTA, EGTA, NTA, etc.) can be mentioned. Among the methods for removing the enzyme or stopping the reaction of the enzyme, the method by alkali treatment and the method of adding a chelating agent do not require a separation operation, and a series of operations are performed in the same reaction tank in an automatic analyzer. Since it can be performed, it is preferable. Here, the separation operation refers to a column chromatography operation, a membrane filtration operation, an adsorption separation operation, an extraction separation operation, a precipitation separation operation, and the like performed in the course of a series of steps for measuring HMGCoA in a test solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　MVAを除く工程において用いることのできる酵素は、MVAを反応式1に関与しないような物質に変換することができるものであれば限定されず、例えば反応式21を触媒する酵素を用いることができる。そのような酵素の特定の例として、例えばヒト、マウス、ラットなどの哺乳類由来、酵母などの真核生物由来、Enterococcus faecalisなどの原核生物由来のMVKが挙げられる。またそれらのMVKと、アミノ酸配列において、60%以上、好ましくは75%以上、より好ましくは90%以上の相同性を有するタンパク質であって、酵素反応によりMVAを除くことができる酵素もまた、これらの安定性、反応性、生産性などを考慮し適宜選択して用いることができる。例えばSaccharomyces cerevisiae由来の配列番号5の塩基配列(Curr. Genet. 1991 Jan;19(1):9-14)でコードされるアミノ酸配列をもつタンパク質は反応式21を触媒する酵素であり、これを用いることができる。さらにMVKの塩基配列またはアミノ酸配列を改変し、そのアミノ酸配列において欠失、付加、および／または置換を加えたものであって、反応性、安定性、生産性、精製効率などの性能を向上させた、酵素反応によりMVAを除くことができる酵素も用いることができる。MVKをPEG等で化学修飾または重合化して反応性、安定性などの性能を向上させた、酵素反応によりMVAを除くことができる酵素も用いることができる。\n\n\nThe enzyme that can be used in the process excluding MVA is not limited as long as it can convert MVA into a substance that does not participate in \nReaction Formula\n 1. For example, an enzyme that catalyzes Reaction Formula 21 can be used. . Specific examples of such enzymes include MVKs derived from mammals such as humans, mice and rats, eukaryotic organisms such as yeast, and prokaryotic organisms such as Enterococcus faecalis. In addition, these MVKs and proteins having homology of 60% or more, preferably 75% or more, more preferably 90% or more in amino acid sequence, which can remove MVA by enzymatic reaction, In consideration of stability, reactivity, productivity and the like, it can be appropriately selected and used. For example, a protein having an amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 (Curr. Genet. 1991 Jan; 19 (1): 9-14) derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an enzyme that catalyzes reaction formula 21, Can be used. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence of MVK is modified, and deletion, addition, and / or substitution is added to the amino acid sequence to improve performance such as reactivity, stability, productivity, and purification efficiency. An enzyme capable of removing MVA by an enzymatic reaction can also be used. An enzyme capable of removing MVA by an enzymatic reaction, in which MVK is chemically modified or polymerized with PEG or the like to improve performance such as reactivity and stability, can also be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　MVAを除く工程において用いることのできる酵素は、上記HMGRの製造について記載したように、当業者に公知の手法に準じて行うことができる。例えば、MVKを生産する酵母、古細菌、真性細菌等を培養し、その細胞内に蓄積させて、または培養液に分泌させて生産した後、一般に用いられる酵素精製法に従って精製すればよい。\n\n\nThe enzyme that can be used in the step of removing MVA can be performed according to a method known to those skilled in the art as described for the production of HMGR.

By using this for measurement of MVA and / or HMGCoA, the blank reaction is reduced and the S / N ratio is improved, so that the measurement sensitivity is also improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　一方、本発明に係る測定方法において、被検液中にMVAおよびHMGCoAの両物質が存在する場合であって、MVAのみの濃度を測定しようとする際には、1)被検液中のMVAを除去したサンプルと除去しないサンプルの2つを準備し、それぞれのサンプルに反応式1および反応式2の反応を触媒する酵素を作用させ、それらの測定量の差から被検液中のMVAを算出する、または2)被検液に反応式1および反応式2の反応を触媒する酵素を作用させる工程に先立って、被検液中のHMGCoAを除く工程を行うことが望ましい。上記1)については上述の被検液中のMVAを除く工程を用いて被検液中のMVAを除去したサンプルを準備して行うことができる。上記2)について、被検液中のHMGCoAを除く工程は、測定対象であるMVAを除くことなく行うことができれば特に制限されず、例えば、HMGCoA特異的な吸着剤や選択的な膜によって被検液を処理する方法や、HMGCoAを反応式2に関与しないような物質に変換する方法を用いることができる。HMGCoAを反応式2に関与しないような物質に変換する方法としては例えば酵素反応を用いる方法が挙げられる。酵素反応を用いる方法の例として：酵素として例えばハイドロキシメチルグルタリルコエンザイムAリアーゼ(EC4.1.3.4：以下、HMGLともいう)を用い、以下の反応式22：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nに記載のように、HMGCoAをアセト酢酸とアセチルコエンザイムAに変換する方法；\n\n酵素として例えばハイドロキシメチルグルタリルコエンザイムAハイドロラーゼ(EC3.1.2.5)を用い、以下の反応式23：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nに記載のように、HMGCoAを3-ハイドロキシメチルグルタリル酸とコエンザイムAに変換する方法；\n\n酵素として例えばハイドロキシメチルグルタリルコエンザイムAシンセターゼ(EC2.3.3.10)を用い、以下の反応式24：\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nに記載のように、HMGCoAをアセチルコエンザイムAとアセトアセチルコエンザイムAに変換する方法などが挙げられる。酵素反応によってHMGCoAを除く工程において、反応液のpH、緩衝液、塩濃度等を最適になるように変化させることができる。また、必要に応じ、生成物にさらに作用する酵素(例えば、反応式22の生成物であるアセト酢酸を二酸化炭素と酢酸に分解するアセト酢酸脱炭酸酵素(EC4.1.1.4))添加を行うことができる。\n\nOn the other hand, in the measurement method according to the present invention, when both the MVA and HMGCoA substances exist in the test solution, and when trying to measure the concentration of only MVA, 1) MVA in the test solution Prepare two samples, one with and without sample removed, and act on each sample with an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of \nReaction Formula\n 1 and Reaction Formula 2, and calculate the MVA in the test solution from the difference in the measured amount. It is desirable to perform the step of calculating or 2) removing HMGCoA in the test solution prior to the step of allowing the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of \nReaction Formula\n 1 and Reaction Formula 2 to act on the test solution. The above 1) can be performed by preparing a sample from which the MVA in the test solution has been removed using the above-described step of removing the MVA in the test solution. Regarding the above 2), the step of removing HMGCoA in the test solution is not particularly limited as long as it can be performed without removing the measurement target MVA. A method of treating the liquid or a method of converting HMGCoA into a substance that does not participate in Reaction Scheme 2 can be used. An example of a method for converting HMGCoA into a substance that does not participate in Reaction Formula 2 is a method using an enzyme reaction. As an example of a method using an enzymatic reaction: For example, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase (EC4.1.3.4: hereinafter also referred to as HMGL) is used as an enzyme, and the following reaction formula 22: \n \n \n \n \n A method of converting HMGCoA to acetoacetic acid and acetylcoenzyme A as described in \n For example, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A hydrolase (EC3.1.2.5) is used as an enzyme, and the following reaction formula 23: \n \n \n \n \n A method for converting HMGCoA to 3-hydroxymethylglutaric acid and coenzyme A as described in \n For example, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthetase (EC 2.3.3.10) is used as an enzyme, and the following reaction formula 24: \n \n \n \n \n And a method of converting HMGCoA into acetyl coenzyme A and acetoacetyl coenzyme A, as described in. In the step of removing HMGCoA by enzymatic reaction, the pH, buffer solution, salt concentration, etc. of the reaction solution can be changed to be optimal. If necessary, an enzyme that further acts on the product (for example, acetoacetate decarboxylase (EC4.1.1.4) that decomposes acetoacetate, which is the product of reaction formula 22) into carbon dioxide and acetic acid, is added. be able to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　上述のように、酵素(例えばHMGL)反応を用いて被検液中のHMGCoAを除く工程の後、そのまま反応式1および反応式2の組み合わせによる酵素サイクリング反応に供すると、反応式1によってMVAから変換されたHMGCoAに前記酵素(例えばHMGL)が作用することになる。したがって、酵素反応を用いて被検液からHMGCoAを除く工程の後、用いた酵素を取り除くか、または酵素の反応を停止させることが望ましい。例えば、膜を用いた限外ろ過によって、酵素を取り除くことができ、酵素がHMGLである場合、例えば分画分子量5000～30000の膜を用いて限外ろ過することで、MVAを除くことなくHMGLを除くことができる。また、酵素の反応を停止させるには、加熱処理、酸処理、アルカリ処理、酵素失活物質の添加など、MVAを分解することなく所望の酵素を失活させる方法、所望の酵素(例えばHMGL)の活性を阻害するが、反応式1および反応式2の反応を触媒する酵素(例えば、HMGR)の活性を阻害しない物質を反応液に加える方法などを用いることができる。上記の酵素を取り除くか、または酵素の反応を停止させる方法のうち、アルカリ処理による方法は、分離操作を必要とせず、自動分析機において同一反応槽で一連の操作を行うことができるため好ましい。ここで、分離操作とは、被検液中のMVAを測定する一連の工程の過程で行われる、カラムクロマトグラフィー操作、膜ろ過操作、吸着分離操作、抽出分離操作、沈殿分離操作などをいう。\n\n\nAs described above, after the step of removing HMGCoA in the test solution using an enzyme (for example, HMGL) reaction, when subjected to the enzyme cycling reaction by the combination of \nreaction formula\n 1 and reaction formula 2, The enzyme (for example, HMGL) acts on the converted HMGCoA. Therefore, it is desirable to remove the used enzyme or stop the enzyme reaction after the step of removing HMGCoA from the test solution using the enzyme reaction. For example, the enzyme can be removed by ultrafiltration using a membrane. When the enzyme is HMGL, for example, by performing ultrafiltration using a membrane having a molecular weight cut off of 5000 to 30000, HMGL can be obtained without removing MVA. Can be excluded. In addition, in order to stop the reaction of the enzyme, heat treatment, acid treatment, alkali treatment, addition of an enzyme deactivating substance, a method of deactivating a desired enzyme without decomposing MVA, a desired enzyme (for example, HMGL) For example, a method of adding a substance that inhibits the activity of the reaction but does not inhibit the activity of the enzyme (for example, HMGR) that catalyzes the reaction of \nReaction Scheme\n 1 and Reaction Scheme 2 to the reaction solution can be used. Among the methods for removing the enzyme or stopping the reaction of the enzyme, an alkali treatment method is preferable because it does not require a separation operation and a series of operations can be performed in the same reaction tank in an automatic analyzer. Here, the separation operation refers to a column chromatography operation, a membrane filtration operation, an adsorption separation operation, an extraction separation operation, a precipitation separation operation, and the like performed in the course of a series of steps for measuring MVA in a test solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　HMGCoAを除く工程において用いることのできる酵素は、HMGCoAを反応式2に関与しないような物質に変換することができるものであれば限定されず、例えば上記の反応式22～24を触媒する酵素を用いることができる。そのような酵素の特定の例として、例えばヒト、マウス、ラットなどの哺乳類由来、Pseudomonas mevaloniiなどの原核生物由来のHMGLが挙げられる。またそれらのHMGLと、アミノ酸配列において、60%以上、好ましくは75%以上、より好ましくは90%以上の相同性を有するタンパク質であって、酵素反応によりHMGCoAを除くことができる酵素もまた、これらの安定性、反応性、生産性などを考慮し適宜選択して用いることができる。例えば配列番号6のアミノ酸配列を有するPseudomonas mevalonii由来のHMGL(J Bacteriol. 1989 Dec;171(12):6468-72)と60%の相同性を有する、配列番号7のアミノ酸配列を有するPseudomonas putida KT2440(ATCC47054)由来のタンパク質は、反応式22を触媒する酵素であることを本発明者は見出したので、これを用いることができる。さらにHMGLの塩基配列またはアミノ酸配列を改変し、そのアミノ酸配列において欠失、付加、および／または置換を加えたものであって、反応性、安定性、生産性、精製効率などの性能を向上させた、酵素反応によりHMGCoAを除くことができる酵素も用いることができる。HMGLをPEG等で化学修飾または重合化して反応性、安定性などの性能を向上させた、酵素反応によりHMGCoAを除くことができる酵素も用いることができる。\n\n\nThe enzyme that can be used in the step of removing HMGCoA is not limited as long as it can convert HMGCoA into a substance that does not participate in Reaction Formula 2. For example, an enzyme that catalyzes the above Reaction Formulas 22 to 24 can be used. Can be used. Specific examples of such enzymes include HMGLs derived from mammals such as humans, mice and rats, and prokaryotic organisms such as Pseudomonas mevalonii. Moreover, these HMGLs are proteins having a homology of 60% or more, preferably 75% or more, more preferably 90% or more in amino acid sequence, and enzymes capable of removing HMGCoA by an enzymatic reaction are also used. In consideration of stability, reactivity, productivity and the like, it can be appropriately selected and used. For example, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 having 60% homology with HMGL (\nJ\n 60 Bacteriol. 1989 Dec; 171 (12): 6468-72) from Pseudomonas mevalonii having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 and having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 Since the present inventor has found that the protein derived from (ATCC47054) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction formula 22, it can be used. Furthermore, the base sequence or amino acid sequence of HMGL is modified, and deletions, additions, and / or substitutions are added to the amino acid sequence to improve performance such as reactivity, stability, productivity, and purification efficiency. An enzyme that can remove HMGCoA by an enzymatic reaction can also be used. An enzyme capable of removing HMGCoA by an enzymatic reaction in which performance such as reactivity and stability is improved by chemically modifying or polymerizing HMGL with PEG or the like can also be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　HMGCoAを除く工程において用いることのできる酵素は、上記HMGRの製造について記載したように、当業者に公知の手法に準じて行うことができる。例えば、HMGLを生産する酵母、古細菌、真性細菌等を培養し、その細胞内に蓄積させて、または培養液に分泌させて生産した後、一般に用いられる酵素精製法に従って精製すればよい。\n\n\nThe enzyme that can be used in the step of removing HMGCoA can be performed according to a method known to those skilled in the art as described for the production of HMGR.

A calibration curve that represents the relationship between the amount of signal and the concentration of substance A using a liquid (called a calibrator) is required. Therefore, in an ordinary laboratory, the amount of substance A in the test solution whose amount is unknown is measured using not only the measurement reagent but also the calibrator. \n When the amount of substance A is measured in different laboratories, an error occurs between the value measured in laboratory a and the value measured in laboratory b for the amount of substance A in the same test solution. This error occurs because the measurement reagent and its measurement procedure, measurement device, calibrator, measurer, etc. are different, but it is required in clinical laboratories at medical sites to minimize the error between laboratories. Yes. In order to minimize this interlaboratory error as much as possible, a standard substance for substance A and a standard measurement method for substance A are defined, and the amount of substance A present in calibrators used on a daily basis is priced. Therefore, it is only necessary to establish traceability of substance A measurement (Clin Chem. 2009 Jun; 55 (6): 1067-75) in which measurement is carried out by daily measurement methods. \n Here, in order to establish traceability of MVA measurement, it is first necessary to define a standard substance and a standard measurement method. MVA and D, L-MVA that are generally sold as reagents (for example, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. product code M1374: D-Mevalonolactone and Sigma product number M4667: (±) -Mevalonolactone (DL-Mevalonic acid lactone)) The exact purity is unknown, and its purity measurement method is also a method with low specificity such as titration, a method in which absolute amount cannot be measured without the presence of a standard substance such as GC, or only the content ratio of optical isomers. Measurement by ellipsometry and NMR (J Lipid Res. 1982 May; 23 (4): 645-52), or by conjugated with pyruvate quinanase and lactate dehydrogenase on MVK (Methods Enzymol. 1969) ; 15: 393-454), which is known only as a method that is considered to be insufficient in accuracy as will be described later. Therefore, as a candidate for a standard measurement method, the present inventor measures the exact amount of MVA based on the extinction coefficient of NAD (P) H in a reaction system in which NAD (P) H increases using the specificity of the enzyme. Two methods were devised. \n One method is reaction scheme 21 using MVK: \n \n \n \n \n \nReaction formula\n 25 using ADP-dependent hexokinase (also called ADP-specific glucokinase (EC2.7.1.47)): \n \n \n \n \n Reaction formula 26 using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49): \n \n \n \n \n Reaction formula 27 using 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31): \n \n \n \n \n , Which can convert all MVA (D-MVA) to NAD (P) H and measure the exact amount of MVA (D-MVA) using the NAD (P) H extinction coefficient Can do. Here, the reaction formula 27 adjusts the pH (for example, 8.0 or more, preferably 8.5 or more, more preferably 9.0 or more), so that the reaction formula 27 proceeds without an enzyme, so that 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC3. 3.3.31) may not be used. It is also possible to use the substrate on which ADP-dependent hexokinase acts in place of glucose in \nreaction formula\n 25 and perform the reaction corresponding to reaction formula 26 using the dehydrogenase corresponding to the product. \n Another method is \nreaction formula\n 11 using HMGR: \n \n \n \n \n Preferably, reaction scheme 22 using HMGL: \n \n \n \n \n , Which can convert all MVA (D-MVA) to NAD (P) H and measure the exact amount of MVA (D-MVA) using the NAD (P) H extinction coefficient Can do. Here, reaction formula 22 is reaction formula 23 using hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.5): \n \n \n \n \n Or Scheme 24 using hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthetase (EC 2.3.3.10): \n \n \n \n \n It is also possible to replace with. \n MVA in aqueous solution is considered to be in an equilibrium state of lactone and hydroxy carboxylic acid hydrolyzed by lactone with dehydration condensation of hydroxy group and carboxyl group in the molecule, but from the viewpoint of structure of substrate and product involved in reaction Therefore, MVK and HMGR are considered to act on MVA of hydroxycarboxylic acid, not lactone. As one of the factors that the optimal pH for the reaction from MVA to mevalonate phosphate by MVK and the reaction from MVA to HMGcoA by HMGR is in the high pH region, the lactone is hydrolyzed in the high pH region and the equilibrium is hydroxycarboxylic. It is mentioned that it is biased toward acid. Therefore, when MVA is to be accurately measured by an enzymatic reaction using MVK or HMGR, it is important to bias the equilibrium to hydroxycarboxylic acid. To that end, lactonase that hydrolyzes the lactone of MVA is added. However, from the standpoint of simplicity, the reaction pH is in the high pH range (the pH of the reagent or reaction solution is 8.5 or higher, preferably 9.0 or higher, more preferably 9.5 or higher, more preferably 10.0 or higher. Is desirable). On the other hand, the optimum pH for the reaction of NAD (P) H generated by dehydrogenase is in the high pH range as long as the stability of the components involved in the reaction such as enzyme and substrate can be maintained, and the reaction of NAD (P) generated It is generally known that the optimum pH is in the low pH range as long as the stability of the components involved in the reaction, such as enzymes and substrates, can be maintained. When measuring the increase of NAD (P) H by dehydrogenase, it is a high pH. When measuring the decrease of the region, NAD (P) H, it is desirable to be in the low pH region. However, in the method of measuring the above-mentioned MVK with pyruvate quinanase and lactate dehydrogenase and reducing NADH, a high pH region is desirable in the reaction with MVK, and a low pH region is desirable in the reaction with lactate dehydrogenase. (Methods Enzymol. 1969; 15: 393-454, pH is set to 7.3-7.4). In addition, the amount of NADH that can be added to the reaction system is limited due to the problem of absorbance. Due to problems such as reaction, the reaction system is insufficient to accurately measure the amount of MVA. In addition, when the MVA is to be accurately measured by an enzyme reaction using MVK or HMGR, the reaction pH must be in a high pH range, for example, a reagent or a reaction solution, in order to bias the equilibrium to hydroxycarboxylic acid. As described above, it is important that the pH of the liquid is 8.5 or higher, preferably 9.0 or higher, more preferably 9.5 or higher, and even more preferably 10.0 or higher. However, in such a high pH region, a coenzyme (eg, CoA) is used. From the viewpoint of the stability of the enzyme, and from the viewpoints of the stability and reactivity of the enzyme used in combination with MVK, HMGR, and the like, it was unthinkable that the reaction proceeds stably and sufficiently. However, surprisingly, the present inventor discovered that the reaction proceeds stably and sufficiently in the reaction system in which NAD (P) H increases using the above MVK or HMGR, and the absorption of NAD (P) H. Based on the coefficient, they discovered a method for accurately measuring the exact amount of MVA in a short time (eg, within 30 minutes, within 15 minutes, within 10 minutes). \n By these methods, it is possible to provide a reference material with an accurate amount of MVA, and to establish traceability of MVA measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　CoAの場合においてもMVAと同様にHMGRとHMGLの反応式を組み合わせる方法、HMGRとハイドロキシメチルグルタリルコエンザイムAハイドロラーゼの反応式を組み合わせる方法、またはHMGRとハイドロキシメチルグルタリルコエンザイムAシンセターゼの反応式を組み合わせる方法により、正確なCoA量が値付けされた標準物質を提供することができ、CoA測定のトレーサビレティを確立することができる。\n\n　HMGCoAの場合においてはHMGRでHMGCoAからMVAとCoAを生成させ、その生成させたMVAを上記のMVK、ADP依存ヘキソキナーゼ、グルコース-6-リン酸デヒドロゲナーゼ、6-ホスホグルコノラクトナーゼを用いた反応式を組み合わせる方法により、MVAと同様に、正確なHMGCoA量が値付けされた標準物質を提供することができ、HMGCoA測定のトレーサビレティを確立することができる。\n\n　また、このようなMVA、CoAまたはHMGCoAの標準物質には酸、塩基、金属イオン、糖類、アルコール類、アミノ酸類、タンパク質、塩類、緩衝成分、界面活性剤、キレート剤、血液成分などその他有機化合物の添加物を保存安定性など性能向上のために適宜加えてもよく、その形態は溶液、凍結品、凍結乾燥品であってもよい。\n\nIn the case of CoA as well as MVA, the method of combining the reaction formula of HMGR and HMGL, the method of combining the reaction formula of HMGR and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A hydrolase, or the reaction formula of HMGR and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthetase By combining methods, it is possible to provide a reference material with an accurate amount of CoA, and to establish traceability of CoA measurement. \n In the case of HMGCoA, MVA and CoA are generated from HMGCoA with HMGR, and the generated MVA is a reaction formula using the above MVK, ADP-dependent hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase In the same way as MVA, the method can be used to provide a reference material with an accurate HMGCoA amount, and to establish traceability of HMGCoA measurement. \n In addition, MVA, CoA or HMGCoA standard substances include acids, bases, metal ions, sugars, alcohols, amino acids, proteins, salts, buffer components, surfactants, chelating agents, blood components and other organic compounds.

Un virus oncolytique est un virus qui lyse préférentiellement les cellules cancéreuses, tout en n'ayant que peu d'effet sur les cellules non cancéreuses. La virothérapie oncolytique constitue une approche thérapeutique intéressante pour compléter l'arsenal des thérapies anticancéreuses disponibles.\nThe present invention relates to the use of an attenuated vaccine strain of Myxoma virus as an oncolytic agent. An oncolytic virus is a virus that preferentially lyses cancer cells, while having little effect on non-cancer cells. Oncolytic virotherapy is an interesting therapeutic approach to complement the arsenal of available cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLe virus de la myxomatose (MYXV) également dénommé Myxoma virus, appartient au genre Leporipoxvirus dans la famille des Poxviridae. Il est l'agent responsable de la myxomatose, une maladie infectieuse majeure chez le lapin européen, et endémique en Europe. Ce virus présente un spectre d'hôte étroit et n'est pas pathogène pour l'Homme.\nThe myxomatosis virus (MYXV), also called Myxoma virus, belongs to the genus Leporipoxvirus in the family Poxviridae. It is the causative agent of myxomatosis, a major infectious disease in European rabbits, and endemic in Europe. This virus has a narrow host spectrum and is not pathogenic for humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa séquence complète du génome de la souche Lausanne du MYXV (souche pathogène de référence) est connue (CAMERON et al, Virology, 264, 298- 318, 1999 ; GenBank NC_001132). Ce génome est constitué d'une molécule linéaire d'ADN bicaténaire d'environ 162 kpb. Il contient une région centrale fortement conservée dans la famille des Poxviridae, contenant les gènes essentiels à la réplication virale, encadrée par des zones plus variables contenant des gènes dits de virulence, et deux répétitions inversées terminales (RIT) de 11,5 kbp. Il comprend au total 170 cadres de lecture ouverts dont 12 sont présents en double copie dans les RIT. Certaines des protéines codées par ces 12 cadres de lecture ont été identifiées comme constituant des facteurs de virulence, interférant avec les défenses immunitaires de l'hôte. On citera notamment la serpine Serpl, décrite comme possédant des propriétés inhibitrices de la réponse inflammatoire et de l'activation du complément ; les virocepteurs M-Tl, M-T2, et M-T7, décrits comme interférant avec des chimiokines impliquées dans la réponse antivirale : CC-chimiokines dans le cas de M-Tl, TNF dans le cas de M-T2, et l'IFN- gamma dans celui de M-T7 ; les protéines M-T2, MT4, et MT5, qui constitueraient des inhibiteurs de l'apoptose des cellules infectées. Malgré sa grande spécificité d'hôte, il a été montré que le MYXV pouvait infecter de façon productive un grande variété de cellules tumorales in vitro (SYPULA et al, Gen Ther Mol Biol, 8, 103-114, 2004), et qu'il présentait une activité oncolytique dans les cellules d'adénocarcinome pancréatique humain in vitro (WOO et al, Ann Surg Oncol, 15, 2329-35, 2008), et dans des modèles murins de gliomes, de médulloblastomes et de tumeurs rhabdoïdes humaines in vivo Lun (LUN et al, Cancer Res, 65, 9982-90, 2005; LUN et al, Cancer Res, 67, 8818-27, 2007 ; WU et al, Clin Cancer Res, 14, 1218-27, 2008). Il a ainsi été proposé de l'utiliser comme agent \n\n oncolytique (Demande PCT WO2004/078206). La Demande PCT WO2007/143548, et BARRETT et al. (J. Neurovirol, 13, 549-560, 2007), décrivent des essais d'inactivation de certains gènes de Myxoma virus codant pour des protéines impliquées dans le tropisme cellulaire vis-à-vis des cellules de lapin (MI lL, M063, M135, M136, M-T2, M-T4, M-T5 et M-T7), dans le but de tester les effets de cette inactivation sur la capacité des Myxoma virus à infecter et tuer des cellules de gliome humain, et d'utiliser ces Myxoma virus pour le traitement du cancer, notamment du gliome ; les Myxoma virus dans lesquels le gène M063 ou le gène Ml 35 a été inactivé se répliquent dans les cellules de gliome plus efficacement que le virus de type sauvage, et réduisent la viabilité des cellules de gliome qu'ils ont infectées.\nThe complete sequence of the genome of the Lausanne strain of MYXV (reference pathogenic strain) is known (CAMERON et al., Virology, 264, 298-31, 1999, GenBank NC_001132). This genome consists of a linear double-stranded DNA molecule of about 162 kbp. It contains a highly conserved central region in the family of Poxviridae, containing the genes essential for viral replication, flanked by more variable zones containing so-called virulence genes, and two inverted terminal repeats (RIT) of 11.5 kbp. It includes a total of 170 open reading frames of which 12 are present in duplicate in the ITRs. Some of the proteins encoded by these 12 frames of reading have been identified as constituting virulence factors, interfering with the immune defenses of the host. Serpine serpin, described as possessing inhibitory properties of the inflammatory response and complement activation, will be mentioned; the M-Tl, M-T2, and M-T7 viroceptors, described as interfering with chemokines involved in the antiviral response: CC-chemokines in the case of M-T1, TNF in the case of M-T2, and IFN-gamma in that of M-T7; M-T2, MT4, and MT5 proteins, which would be inhibitors of apoptosis of infected cells. Despite its high host specificity, it has been shown that MYXV can productively infect a wide variety of tumor cells in vitro (SYPULA et al., Gen Ther Mol Biol, 8, 103-114, 2004), and that it exhibited oncolytic activity in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in vitro (WOO et al., Ann Surg Oncol, 15, 2329-35, 2008), and in murine models of gliomas, medulloblastomas and human rhabdoid tumors in vivo Lun (LUN et al., Cancer Res, 65, 9982-90, 2005, LUN et al, Cancer Res, 67, 8818-27, 2007, WU et al, Clin Cancer Res, 14, 1218-27, 2008). It has thus been proposed to use it as an agent  oncolytic (PCT Application WO2004 / 078206). PCT Application WO2007 / 143548, and BARRETT et al. (J. Neurovirol, 13, 549-560, 2007) describe inactivation assays of certain Myxoma virus genes encoding proteins involved in cellular tropism with respect to rabbit cells (MI1L, M063, M135, M136, M-T2, M-T4, M-T5 and M-T7), in order to test the effects of this inactivation on the ability of Myxoma virus to infect and kill human glioma cells, and to use these Myxoma virus for the treatment of cancer, especially glioma; Myxoma viruses in which the M063 gene or the M1 gene has been inactivated replicate in glioma cells more efficiently than the wild-type virus, and reduce the viability of the glioma cells that they have infected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIl a été rapporté que la permissivité des cellules tumorales humaines à l'infection par un Myxoma virus était liée d'une part au niveau d'activation de la sérine/thréonine kinase Akt-1/PKB dans la cellule tumorale, et d'autre part à l'expression chez le virus d'une protéine M-T5 fonctionnelle, qui est capable d'induire la phosphorylation et l'activation d'Akt-1/PKB. On peut ainsi distinguer 3 types de cellules tumorales : chez les cellules de type I, Akt-1/PKB est fortement activée de manière constitutive, et ces cellules sont permissives à l'infection par un Myxoma virus même si celui-ci n'exprime pas M-T5 ; chez les cellules de type II, le niveau basai d'activation Akt-1/PKB est faible, mais elle est activée par l'interaction avec M-T5 : ces cellules ne sont permissives qu'aux Myxoma virus exprimant M-T5 ; enfin, chez les cellules de type III, le niveau basai d'activation Akt-1/PKB est également faible, et elle n'est pas activée par M-T5 : ces cellules ne sont pas permissives aux Myxoma virus . Le traitement de cellules tumorales non permissives avec un agent capable d'augmenter l'activation d'Akt-1/PKB, tel que la rapamycine, permet d'améliorer grandement leur sensibilité à l'infection par les Myxoma virus (STANFORD & MCFADDEN, Expert Opin Biol Ther, 7, 1415-25, 2007 ; LUN et al, Cancer Res, 67, 8818-27, 2007).\nThe permissiveness of human tumor cells to Myxoma virus infection has been reported to be related to the level of activation of serine / threonine kinase Akt-1 / PKB in the tumor cell, and other to the expression in the virus of a functional M-T5 protein, which is capable of inducing phosphorylation and activation of Akt-1 / PKB. Three types of tumor cells can thus be distinguished: in type I cells, Akt-1 / PKB is strongly constitutively activated, and these cells are permissive to infection by a Myxoma virus even if it expresses no not M-T5; in type II cells, the basal level of Akt-1 / PKB activation is low, but it is activated by the interaction with M-T5: these cells are permissive only to Myxoma virus expressing M-T5; finally, in type III cells, the basal level of Akt-1 / PKB activation is also weak, and it is not activated by M-T5: these cells are not permissive to Myxoma virus. Treatment of non-permissive tumor cells with an agent capable of increasing Akt-1 / PKB activation, such as rapamycin, greatly improves their susceptibility to Myxoma virus infection (STANFORD & MCFADDEN, Expert Opin Biol Ther, 7, 1415-25, 2007; LUN et al, Cancer Res, 67, 8818-27, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLes Inventeurs ont maintenant constaté qu'une souche atténuée vaccinale de Myxoma virus , la souche SG33, se répliquait plus efficacement et diffusait mieux dans les cellules tumorales, et possédait une activité oncolytique supérieure et un spectre d'action plus large qu'une souche sauvage telle que la souche Lausanne.\nThe inventors have now found that an attenuated vaccine strain of Myxoma virus, strain SG33, replicates more efficiently and diffuses better in tumor cells, and has a higher oncolytic activity and a wider spectrum of action than a wild strain. such as the Lausanne strain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa souche SG33 (CNCM 1-1594) est décrite dans le Brevet FR 2736358. Les Inventeurs ont comparé le génome de SG33 avec celui de la souche de référence Lausanne, afin de déterminer quelles étaient les différences entre ces deux souches pouvant affecter la production ou la fonction de protéines virales. Ils ont constaté que la souche SG33 contient une délétion d'environ\nThe strain SG33 (CNCM 1-1594) is described in the patent FR 2736358. The inventors compared the genome of SG33 with that of the reference strain Lausanne, in order to determine which were the differences between these two strains that could affect the production or the function of viral proteins. They found that strain SG33 contains a deletion of approximately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n15 kb dans la partie droite de son génome.

The genes affected by this deletion are listed in Table I below:  Table I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLes positions sur le génome et les numéros d'accès GenBank sont ceux des gènes et protéines correspondants chez la souche de référence Lausanne.\nThe positions on the genome and the GenBank access numbers are those of the corresponding genes and proteins in the reference strain Lausanne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLes gènes Ml 5 IR et M001R ne sont que partiellement délétés, donnant lieu à des protéines tronquées inactives. Les gènes M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R, ainsi que les gènes de l'ITR droite M008.1R, M008R, M007R, M006R, M005R, M004.1R, M004R, M003.2R, M003.1R, et M002R sont complètement délétés. Les protéines codées par les gènes M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R, sont donc absentes ; en revanche, une autre copie des gènes M008.1R, M008R, M007R, M006R, M005R, M004.1R, M004R, M003.2R, M003.1R, et M002R étant présente dans la RIT gauche, on peut supposer que les protéines correspondantes sont toujours produites, bien que probablement en quantité plus faible.\nThe Ml 5 IR and M001R genes are only partially deleted, giving rise to inactive truncated proteins. The genes M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R, as well as the right RTI genes M008.1R, M008R, M007R, M006R, M005R, M004.1R, M004R, M003.2R, M003.1R, and M002R are completely deleted. . The proteins encoded by the M152R, M153R, M154L and M156R genes are therefore absent; on the other hand, another copy of the M008.1R, M008R, M007R, M006R, M005R, M004.1R, M004R, M003.2R, M003.1R, and M002R genes being present in the left RIT, it may be assumed that the corresponding proteins are still produced, although probably in smaller quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUne autre différence entre le génome de la souche SG33 et celui de la souche Lausanne se situe au niveau du gène M011L (positions 14125-13628 dans le génome de la souche Lausanne), codant pour un inhibiteur de l'apoptose (MI lL, GenBank NP_051725). \n\n Dans la souche SG33 ce gène est interrompu par un codon stop, conduisant à l'apparition de deux nouveaux cadres de lecture potentiels et à la production de deux protéines tronquées, Ml IaL (correspondant aux 32 premiers acides aminés de MI lL) et Ml IbL (débutant par la méthionine en position 52 de MI lL). La protéine Ml IaL est probablement inactive, et il est possible que certaines des fonctions de Ml IL soient altérées chez Ml IbL.\nAnother difference between the genome of the SG33 strain and that of the Lausanne strain is located at the M011L gene (positions 14125-13628 in the genome of the Lausanne strain), coding for an inhibitor of apoptosis (MI lL, GenBank NP_051725).  In strain SG33 this gene is interrupted by a stop codon, leading to the appearance of two new potential reading frames and to the production of two truncated proteins, Ml IaL (corresponding to the first 32 amino acids of MI lL) and Ml IbL (starting with methionine at position 52 of MI11). The Ml IaL protein is probably inactive, and it is possible that some of the Ml IL functions are altered in Ml IbL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa présente invention a pour objet un Myxoma virus atténué chez lequel les gènes M151R, M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R, et MOOlR sont inactivés, pour l'utilisation comme médicament oncolytique.

Optionally, said attenuated myxomavirus also carries, in the MO111 gene, a mutation resulting in the expression of a mutant MI IL protein lacking the 51 N-terminal amino acids of the native MI 11 protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDe manière préférée, ledit Myxoma virus est le virus SG33 (CNCM 1-1594).\nPreferably, said Myxoma virus is SG33 virus (CNCM 1-1594).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUn Myxoma virus atténué utilisable conformément à l'invention peut être obtenu à partir d'un Myxoma virus sauvage virulent, notamment par délétion des gènes M151R, M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R, et M001R, et de préférence, par délétion en outre des gènes M008.1R, M008R, M007R, M006R, M005R, M004.1R, M004R, M003.2R, M003.1R, et M002R. Pour chacun des gènes concernés, la délétion doit être de taille suffisante pour que la protéine produite par ce gène soit totalement inactive, et de préférence englobera la totalité du gène. Optionnellement, on peut en outre introduire dans le gène M011L, une mutation, par exemple une délétion ou un codon stop, résultant dans l'expression d'une protéine Ml IL mutante, dépourvue des 51 acides aminés N-terminaux de la protéine MI lL native.\nAn attenuated Myxoma virus which can be used in accordance with the invention can be obtained from a virulent wild-type Myxoma virus, in particular by deletion of the genes M151R, M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R, and M001R, and preferably, by additionally deleting M008.1R, M008R, M007R, M006R, M005R, M004.1R, M004R, M003.2R, M003.1R, and M002R genes. For each of the genes involved, the deletion must be of sufficient size that the protein produced by this gene is completely inactive, and preferably will encompass the entire gene.

Description\n\n\n\n\n ANTI NOTCH-1 ANTIBODIES\n\n\nThe present application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 61/218,193, filed June 18, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to antibodies that antagonize the activity of Notch- 1 , method of producing such antibodies, method of assaying such antibodies and method of using such antibodies in the treatment of cancer.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nNotch proteins are transmembrane receptor proteins. There are four such notch receptors in mammals. During receptor maturation, the ectodomains of mammalian notch receptors are cleaved at a Si site by a furin-like protease, yielding an extracellular subunit and a transmembrane subunit that are held together by a heterodimehzation (HD) domain. The part of HD domain associated with extracellular subunit is referred to as HD-N, and the other part of HD, extracellular moiety of transmembrane subunit, referred to as HD-C. The extracellular subunit contains a large epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat region and three Lin12 repeats. Ligand binding of the EGF-repeat regions induces a proteolytic cleavage by ADAM-type metalloprotease at the S2 site within the HD-C domain,, which triggered subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase at site S\n3\n releases the intracellular part of notch from the membrane, allowing it to move into the nucleus and regulate gene transcription. (Gordon, W. R., et.al, Nature Structural &Molecular Biology, 2007, volume 14, 295-300). Before ligand induced activation, notch is maintained in a resting metalloprotease-resistant confirmation by a conserved negative regulation region (NRR), which consists of the three Lin12 repeats and the HD domain. (Vardar et al., Biochemistry 2003, 41 : 7061 -7067; Sanchez-lrizarry et al., MoI. Cell. Biol. 2004, 24: 9265-9273; Gordon, W.R., et.al, Nature Structural &Molecular Biology, 2007, volume 14, 295-300). NRR of the notch proteins is also sometimes defined as only consisting the Lin12 repeats and the N terminal HD domain (HD-N) after proteolytic cleavage at the Si site. (Weng, A.P., et. al, Science, 2004, 9265-9273.) NRR domain prevents the ligand- independent proteolysis of the notch pathway. \n\n The Notch pathways functions during diverse developmental and physiological process including those affecting neurogenesis in flies and vertebrates. In general, notch signaling is involved in lateral inhibition, lineage decisions, and the establishment of boundaries between groups of cells. (Bray, S.J., Nature Reviews, 2006, 678-688). However, notch activities are also associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer. For example, mutations of notchi were detected in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. (Radtke, F, Nature Review, Cancer, 2003, 756- 767). There is a need in identifying therapeutic agents that regulate the notch-1 signaling pathway for the use of treating cancer.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn one embodiment, this invention provides an isolated antibody, or an antigen binding portion thereof, that binds to Notch-1 , wherein the antibody or antigen binding portion binds to at least a first epitope and a second epitope, wherein the first epitope resides within the Lin-A domain of Notch-1 , and the second epitope resides within the\n\n\nHD-C domain of Notch-1.

Even more specifically, a non conservative substitution of any of the amino acid residues of the first epitope or the second epitope results in a loss of more than 70%, more than 80%, more than 90% or more than 95% of the antibody or antigen binding portion's binding affinity to human Notch-1.\n\n\nIn another aspect of this embodiment, the antibody or the antigen binding portion is humanized, human, or chimeric. Preferably, the antibody or the antigen binding portion is a humanized antibody or antigen binding portion thereof.

Hela/Jagged1 cells and N1dP-c16 cells were co-cultured for the luciferase reporter assay. MIgG is a control mouse antibody. The y-axis numbers are luciferase reporter activity readings. Figure 5 is a sequence alignment of the EFG, Lin-A, Lin-B, Lin-C, HD-N and HD-\n\n\nC domains between human Notchi and human Notch2.\n\n\nFigure 6A is a Western blot image illustrating that level of NICD (Notch 1 intracellular domain) was reduced by mAb N248A in the HPB-ALL cells.\n\n\nFigure 6B illustrates that growth of HPB-AII cells are inhibited by mAb N248A.

Accordingly, the disclosure also provides methods of using the anti-Notch-1 antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof to treat various types of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer.\n\n\nDefinitions. The terms \"Notch-1 \" or \"Notchi \" are used interchangeably, and include variants, isoforms and species homologs of human Notch-1 protein. Native human Notch-1 protein, for example, is made up of a leader peptide, a large epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat region, three Lin12 repeats, a N terminal heterodimerization domain (HD-N), a C terminal heterodimerization domain (HD-C), a transmembrane (TM) sequence and an intracellular domain (NICD). The NCBI/GenBank accession number of the full length human Notch-1 is NM_017617.2\n\n\nThe term \"Notch-1 negative regulatory region\", or \"Notch-1 NRR\" as used herein, unless otherwise indicted, refers to any native or synthetic polypeptide region of Notch-1 consisting of the three Lin12 domains and the amino acid sequence or sequences located between the three Lin12 domains and the transmebrane domain of Notch-1. In one embodiment, the \"Notch-1 NRR\" includes the three Lin12 domains and two heterodimerization domains HD-N, and HD-C, wherein the HD-N and HD-C domains of Notch-1 are covalently bonded and not yet cleaved by the furin-like protease (before S1 \n\n cleavage). In another embodiment, the \"Notch-1 NRR\" includes the three Lin12 domains and the two heterodimerization domains HD-N, and HD-C, wherein the HD-N and HD-C domains are non-covalently bonded (after S1 cleavage). In one aspect of this embodiment, the S2 site within the HD-C domain has not been cleaved by the ADAM- type metalloproteases. In another particular aspect of this embodiment, the S2 site within the HD-C domain is being cleaved or has already been cleaved by the ADAM- type metalloproteases. (Gordon, W. R., et.al, Nature Structural &Molecular Biology, 2007, volume 14, 295-300).\n\n\nThe term \"immune response\" refers to the action of, for example, lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells, phagocytic cells, granulocytes, and soluble macromolecules produced by the above cells or the liver (including antibodies, cytokines, and complement) that results in selective damage to, destruction of, or elimination from the human body of invading pathogens, cells or tissues infected with pathogens, cancerous cells, or, in cases of autoimmunity or pathological inflammation, normal human cells or tissues.\n\n\nA \"signal transduction pathway\" refers to the biochemical relationship between a variety of signal transduction molecules that play a role in the transmission of a signal from one portion of a cell to another portion of a cell. As used herein, the phrase \"cell surface receptor\" includes, for example, molecules and complexes of molecules capable of receiving a signal and the transmission of such a signal across the plasma membrane of a cell. An example of a \"cell surface receptor\" of the present disclosure is the Notch-1 receptor.\n\n\nThe term \"antibody\" as referred to herein includes whole antibodies and any antigen binding fragment (i.e., \"antigen-binding portion\") or single chains thereof. An \"antibody\" refers to a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V\nH\n) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, Cm , C\nH\n2 and C\nH\n3- Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V\nL\n) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, C\nL\n. The V\nH\n and V\nL\n regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, referred to complementarily determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, referred \n\n to framework regions (FR). The CDR regions can be determined using the Kabat or Chothia numbering systems, both of which are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g. Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991 ) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91 - 3242; Chothia and Lesk, J. MoI. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987). Each V\nH\n and V\nL\n is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy- terminus in the following order: FR1 , CDR1 , FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (CIq) of the classical complement system.\n\n\nThe term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody (or simply \"antibody portion\"), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen {e.g., Notch-1 ). It has been shown that the antigen- binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL\n and C\nH\ni domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the V\nH\n and Cm domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341 :544-546), which consists of a V\nH\n domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region\n\n\n(CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, V\nL\n and V\nH\n, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the V\nL\n and V\nH\n regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl.\n\n\nAcad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody. These antibody fragments may be obtained using any suitable technique, including conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments may be screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. \n\n An \"isolated antibody\", as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds Notch-1 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than Notch-1 ). An isolated antibody that specifically binds Notch-1 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as Notch-1 molecules from other species. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.\n\n\nThe terms \"monoclonal antibody\" or \"monoclonal antibody composition\" as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.\n\n\nThe term \"humanized antibody\" is intended to refer to antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. Additional framework region modifications may be made within the human framework sequences.\n\n\nThe term \"chimeric antibody\" is intended to refer to antibodies in which the variable region sequences are derived from one species and the constant region sequences are derived from another species, such as an antibody in which the variable region sequences are derived from a mouse antibody and the constant region sequences are derived from a human antibody.\n\n\nThe terms \"human antibody\", or \"fully human antibody\", as used herein, are intended to include antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the disclosure or antigen binding portions thereof may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.\n\n\nThe terms \"human monoclonal antibody\" or \"fully human monoclonal antibody\" refer to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable regions in \n\n which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, the human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.\n\n\nThe term \"human antibody derivatives\" refers to any modified form of the human antibody, e.g., a conjugate of the antibody and another agent or antibody.\n\n\nThe term \"recombinant human antibody\", as used herein, includes all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a) antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom (described further below), (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the human antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable regions in which the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the V\nH\n and V\nL\n regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline V\nH\n and V\nL\n sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. The term \"compete\", as used herein with regard to an antibody, refers to when a first antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, competes for binding with a second antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, where binding of the first antibody with its cognate epitope is detectably decreased in the presence of the second antibody compared to the binding of the first antibody in the absence of the second antibody. The alternative, where the binding of the second antibody to its epitope is also detectably decreased in the presence of the first antibody, can, but need not be the case. That is, a first antibody can inhibit the binding of a second antibody to its epitope without that second antibody inhibiting the binding of the first antibody to its respective \n\n epitope. However, where each antibody detectably inhibits the binding of the other antibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the same, greater, or lesser extent, the antibodies are said to \"cross-compete\" with each other for binding of their respective epitope(s). For instance, cross-competing antibodies can bind to the epitope, or portion of the epitope, to which the antibodies as disclosed herein bind. Use of both competing and cross-competing antibodies is encompassed by the present disclosure. Regardless of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-competition occurs (e.g., steric hindrance, conformational change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereof, and the like), the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the teachings provided herein, that such competing and/or cross-competing antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the methods disclosed herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, a \"major epitope\" refers to an epitope, wherein if any one of the amino acid residues of the epitope is replaced by an alanine or a non conservative substitution, the binding affinity of the antibody to the antigen which the epitope belongs to, is decreased by more than 50%.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"isotype\" or \"class\" refers to the antibody class [e.g., IgM or IgG) that is encoded by the heavy chain constant region genes. The constant domains of antibodies are not involved in binding to antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region, a given human antibody or immunoglobulin can be assigned to one of five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. The structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well-known. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes, only human IgGI , lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, and IgM are known to activate complement. Human IgGI and lgG3 are known to mediate ADCC in humans.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"subclass\" refers to the further specification within an isotype of the heavy chain constant region gene, such as, for example, the IgGI , lgG2, lgG3, or lgG4 subclasses within the IgG isotype.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"compound\" or \"pharmaceutical compound\" includes antibodies, antigen-binding portions thereof, immunoconjugates, and bispecific molecules. \n\n The phrases \"an antibody recognizing an antigen\" and \"an antibody specific for an antigen\" are used interchangeably herein with the term \"an antibody which binds specifically to an antigen.\"\n\n\nThe terms \"Fc receptor\" or \"FcR\" are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. For example, the FcR can be a native sequence human FcR. Furthermore, the FcR can be one that binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an \"activating receptor\") and FcγRIIB (an \"inhibiting receptor\"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain (see, Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92 (1991 ); Capel et al., Immunomethods, 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \"FcR\" herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., Immunol., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol., 24:249 (1994)).\n\n\nAs used herein, an antibody that \"specifically binds to human Notch-1 \" is intended to refer to an antibody that binds to human Notch-1 with a K\n0\n of 1 x 10\n~5\n M or less.\n\n\nThe term \"k\non\n\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the on-rate, or association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term \"k\nOff\n,\" as used herein, is intended to refer to the off-rate, or dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term \"K\n0\n\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of k\nO\nff to k\non\n (i-θ,. IWk\n0n\n) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K\n0\n values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. One method for determining the K\n0\n of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, typically using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system. \n\n As used herein, the term \"high affinity\" for an antibody refers to an antibody having a K\n0\n of 1 x 10\n~6\n M or less.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"subject\" includes any human or nonhuman animal. The term \"nonhuman animal\" includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non- mammals, such as nonhuman primates, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, cows, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, etc.\n\n\nHuman Notch-1 receptor\n\n\nHuman Notchi cDNA encodes a protein of 2556 amino acid residues consisting of a leader peptide, 36 EGF-like repeats, negative regulatory region (NRR), a transmembrane (TM) sequence and an intracellular domain. (Vardar et al., Biochemistry 2003, 41 : 7061 -7067; Sanchez-lrizarry et al., MoI. Cell. Biol. 2004, 24: 9265-9273; Gordon, W. R., et.al, Nature Structural &Molecular Biology, 2007, volume 14, 295-300). The Notch-1 NRR starts from amino acid residue 1447 and ends at 1734. The Notch-1 NRR consists of LNR-A (Notch-1 AA residues 1447-1483), LNR-B (Notch-1 AA residues 1484-1525), LNR-C (Notch-1 AA residues 1526-1565), N-terminal heterodimerization domain (HD-N, Notch-1 AA residues 1566-1665) and C-terminal heterodimerization domain (HD-C, Notch-1 AA residues 1666 to 1734).\n\n\nThe antibodies of the disclosure are characterized by particular functional features or properties of the antibodies. For example, the antibodies bind specifically to human Notch-1 with a K\n0\n of 1 x 10\n~5\n M or less. Preferably, an antibody of the disclosure binds to Notch-1 with high affinity, for example with a K\n0\n of 1 x 10\n~6\n M or less, more preferably with a K\n0\n of 1x10\n~7\n M or less, even more preferably, with a K\n0\n or 1x 10\n~8\n M or less. Assays to evaluate the binding ability of the antibodies toward Notch-1 include, but are not limited to ELISAs, Western blots, RIAs, and flow cytometry analysis. The binding kinetics (e.g., binding affinity) of the antibodies also can be assessed by assays known in the art, such as by Biacore analysis.\n\n\nMonoclonal Antibody mAb N248A.\n\n\nOne illustrative antibody of the disclosure is the mouse monoclonal antibody N248A, generated, isolated, tested and structurally characterized as described in \n\n Examples 1 -3 and 8. Table 1 lists the amino acid sequences of various regions of mAb N248A and other sequences disclosed herein.\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nSequence SEQ ID\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nNucleotide sequence of ATGCCGCCGCTCCTGGCACCTCTGCTCTGC immunogen Notchi -

Such antibodies may be produced following general methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, such antibodies can be produced through immunization of a mouse with an immunogen comprising the Notch-1 LinA domain and the Notch-1 HD-C domain, as shown in Examples 1 and 2, followed by hybridoma cloning of the antibodies thus generated, and assaying the cloned antibodies by ELISA assay, as shown in Example 2. The Notch-1 binding affinity of the antibodies selected according to the ELISA assay can be measured on a surface plasma resonance Biacore 3000 instrument, as shown in Example 4.\n\n\nThe anti Notch-1 antibodies of the current invention, wherein the antibodies that bind to the Notch-1 LinA domain and Notch-1 HD-C domain can be produced by any other methods known in the art other than described in the above paragraph. The route and schedule of immunization of the host animal are generally in keeping with established and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and production, as further described herein. General techniques for production of human and mouse antibodies are known in the art and/or are described herein.\n\n\nAnti Notch-1 antibodies generated by hvbhdoma technologies. It is within the contemplation of the current invention that that any mammalian subject including humans or antibody producing cells therefrom can be manipulated to serve as the basis for production of mammalian, including human, hybridoma cell lines. Typically, the host animal is inoculated intraperitoneal^, intramuscularly, orally, subcutaneously, intraplantar, and/or intradermal^ with an amount of immunogen, including as described herein.\n\n\nHybridomas can be prepared from the lymphocytes and immortalized myeloma cells using the general somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler, B. and Milstein, C. (1975) Nature 256:495-497 or as modified by Buck, D. W., et al., In Vitro, 18:377-381 (1982). Available myeloma lines, including but not limited to X63-Ag8.653 and those from the SaIk Institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, may be used in the hybridization. Generally, the technique involves fusing myeloma cells and lymphoid cells using a fusogen such as polyethylene glycol, or by electrical means well known to those skilled in the art. After the fusion, the cells are separated from the fusion medium \n\n and grown in a selective growth medium, such as hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium, to eliminate unhybridized parent cells. Any of the media described herein, supplemented with or without serum, can be used for culturing hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibodies. As another alternative to the cell fusion technique, EBV immortalized B cells may be used to produce the Notch-1 monoclonal antibodies of the subject invention. The hybridomas are expanded and subcloned, if desired, and supernatants are assayed for anti-immunogen activity by conventional immunoassay procedures (e.g., radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or fluorescence immunoassay). Hybridomas that may be used as a source of antibodies encompass all derivatives, progeny cells of the parent hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies specific for Notch-1 , or a portion thereof.\n\n\nHybridomas that produce such antibodies may be grown in vitro or in vivo using known procedures. The monoclonal antibodies may be isolated from the culture media or body fluids, by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, chromatography, and ultrafiltration, if desired. Undesired activity, if present, can be removed, for example, by running the preparation over adsorbents made of the immunogen attached to a solid phase and eluting or releasing the desired antibodies off the immunogen. Immunization of a host animal with a human Notch-1 , or a fragment containing the target amino acid sequence conjugated to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or dehvatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N- hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCI2, or R\n1\nN=C=NR, where R and R\n1\n are different alkyl groups, can yield a population of antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies).\n\n\nHumanization of anti Notch-1 antibodies generated by immunization in a host animal. It is within the contemplation of the current invention that anti Notch-1 antibodies of the invention wherein the antibodies are generated by immunization in a host animal can be manipulated in many ways to increase its biological activity and pharmaceutical properties. One way of such manipulation is humanization. \n\n There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1 ) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process (3) the actual humanizing methodologies/techniques and (4) the transfection and expression of the humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331 ,415; 5,530,101 ; 5,693,761 ; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.\n\n\nA number of \"humanized\" antibody molecules comprising an antigen-binding site derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described, including chimeric antibodies having rodent or modified rodent V regions and their associated CDRs fused to human constant domains. See, for example, Winter et al. Nature 349:293-299 (1991 ), Lobuglio et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220-4224 (1989), Shaw et al. J Immunol. 138:4534-4538 (1987), and Brown et al. Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583 (1987). Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human antibody constant domain. See, for example, Riechmann et al. Nature 332:323-327 (1988), Verhoeyen et al. Science 239:1534-1536 (1988), and Jones et al. Nature 321 :522-525 (1986). Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly engineered rodent framework regions. See, for example, European Patent Publication No. 0519596. These \"humanized\" molecules are designed to minimize unwanted immunological response toward rodent anti-human antibody molecules which limits the duration and effectiveness of therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipients. For example, the antibody constant region can be engineered such that it is immunologically inert (e.g., does not trigger complement lysis). See, e.g. PCT Publication No. PCT/GB99/01441 ; UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. Other methods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized are disclosed by Daughterly et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 19:2471 -2476 (1991 ) and in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; 5,866,692; 6,210,671 ; and 6,350,861 ; and in PCT Publication No. WO 01/27160.\n\n\nHuman anti Notch-1 antibodies.\n\n\nIt is within the contemplation of the current invention that fully human anti Notch-1 antibodies may be obtained by using commercially available mice that have been engineered to express specific human immunoglobulin proteins. Transgenic animals \n\n that are designed to produce a more desirable (e.g., fully human antibodies) or more robust immune response may also be used for generation of humanized or human antibodies. Examples of such technology are Xenomouse ™ from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, CA) and HuMAb-Mouse® and TC Mouse™ from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, NJ).\n\n\nIt is also within the contemplation of the current invention that fully human anti Notch-1 antibodies may be obtained recombinantly following general methods of phage display technology. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743; and 6,265,150; and Winter et aL. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-455 (1994). Alternatively, the phage display technology (McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-\n\n\n553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for review see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991 ) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Mark et al., J. MoI. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991 ), or Griffith et al., EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as \"chain shuffling.\" (Marks et al., Bio/Technol. 10:779-783 (1992)). In this method, the affinity of \n\n \"primary\" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the pM-nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as \"the mother-of-all libraries\") has been described by Waterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 21 :2265-2266 (1993).\n\n\nGene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as \"epitope imprinting\", the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable regions capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e., the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT Publication No. WO 93/06213). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin. Although the above discussion pertains to humanized and human antibodies, the general principles discussed are applicable to customizing antibodies for use, for example, in dogs, cats, primate, equines and bovines. One or more aspects of humanizing an antibody described herein may be combined, e.g., CDR grafting, framework mutation and CDR mutation.\n\n\nEngineered and modified anti Notch-1 antibodies made recombinants.\n\n\nIn general, antibodies may be made recombinantly by placing the DNA sequences of the desired antibody into expression vectors followed by transfection and expression in host cells, including but not limited to E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein. PCT Patent Publication No. WO 87/04462. Other host cells, such as transgenic plant cells or transgenic milk cells may also be used. See, for \n\n example, Peeters, et al. Vaccine 19:2756 (2001 ); Lonberg, N. and D. Huszar Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65 (1995); and Pollock, et al., J Immunol Methods 231 :147(1999).\n\n\nAn antibody may also be modified recombinantly. For example, the DNA of the human heavy and light chain constant regions may be used in place of the homologous murine sequences of the murine antibody DNA, Morrison et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81 :6851 (1984), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In similar manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies can be prepared that have the binding specificity of an anti Notch-1 monoclonal antibody herein. Antibody variable regions can also be modified by CDR grafting. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different antibody with different properties (see, e.g., Riechmann, L. et al. (1998) Nature 332:323- 327; Jones, P. et al. (1986) Nature 321:522-525; Queen, C. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. See. U.S.A. 86:10029-10033; U.S. Patent No. 5,225,539 to Winter, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101 ; 5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et al.)\n\n\nAccordingly, another aspect of the disclosure pertains to an isolated monoclonal antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 18, 19 and 20, respectively, and a light chain variable region comprising CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 12, 13 and 14 respectively. Thus, such antibodies contain the V\nH\n and V\nL\n CDR sequences of the monoclonal antibodies N248A, yet may contain different framework sequences from these antibodies. Such framework sequences can be obtained from public DNA databases or published references that include germline antibody gene sequences. Another type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the V\nH\n and/or V\nL\n CDR1 , CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions to thereby improve one or more binding properties {e.g., affinity) of the antibody of interest. Site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis can be performed to introduce the \n\n mutation(s) and the effect on antibody binding, or other functional property of interest, can be evaluated in in vitro or in vivo assays as described herein. Typically, conservative modifications (as discussed below) are introduced. The mutations may be amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. Moreover, typically no more than one, two, three, four or five residues within a CDR region are altered.\n\n\nConservative substitution and antibody affinity maturation will be discussed in more details in later paragraphs.\n\n\nMapping of antigen epitopes that an antibody binds to. The binding epitopes of monoclonal antibodies on an antigen may be mapped by a number of methods depending on the type of antigen-antibody interactions.\n\n\nIf an antibody binds to a single epitope consisting of sequential amino acid residues in an antigen, whose binding usually is not affected by antigen conformational changes, the binding epitope is called a linear epitope. A peptide scanning method is commonly used to identify linear binding epitopes (see Journal of Immunological Methods, Volume 315, Issues 1 -2, pages 11 -18, August 2006), which requires synthesizing a series of overlapping 10-15mer peptides that cover the entire length of the antigen sequence. The peptides are arrayed on a protein-cross-linking membrane in duplicate dotted format. Antibody binding affinity to the peptide array is analyzed similar to ELISA. The peptides-arrayed membrane is first incubated in 1 X PBST with 5% fetal calf serum to block nonspecific binding, then incubated with testing antibodies or nonspecific control antibody followed by incubation with HRP-labeled secondary antibody. The antibody binding strength is read out using a chemiluminescence imaging instrument. Alternatively, a linear binding epitope may be identified using antigen protein domains displayed on yeast cell surface (see Journal of Molecular Biology, 365(1 ), 196- \n\n 200, January 2007) or using antigen protein fragments displayed on bacterial cell surface (see FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 226(2), 347-353, September, 2003; also see Nature Methods, 5(12), 1039-1045, November 2008), followed by flow-cytometric sorting or FACS. Limited proteolysis of peptide antigen and antibody complex, combined with mass spectrometry, may provide another approach to locate linear binding epitopes (see Methods MoI. Biol., 524, 87-101 , 2009). Antigen and antibody are mixed and incubated at appropriate conditions to form a binding complex, which is digested by protease under controlled temperature and time. The bound reaction mixture is then passed through a protein-A affinity column to retain the antibody bound with an antigen epitope fragment, which is analyzed by mass spectrometry after eluted from the column.\n\n\nMapping of conformational epitopes depends on the interaction of antibody to antigen in its native conformation. A number of techniques have been reported useful in determining conformational epitopes. One of the methods commonly used is amino acid mutagenesis. Individual amino acid residues in the antigen protein speculated to bind with the antibody are mutated, and the mutated antigen protein is then expressed and subjected to antibody binding analysis to determine if the binding affinity is impaired. However, systematic amino acid mutagenesis across the complete antigen protein sequence is laborious. To narrow down the regions of antigen protein that interact with antibody, substitution of an individual antigen domain by a closely related protein domain can be a useful method (see J. Biol, chem., 274 (14) 9617-9626, April 1999).\n\n\nShotgun mutagenesis mapping was developed to overcome the shortcomings of conventional amino acid mutagenesis (see J. American Chem. Soc, 131 , 6952-6954, 2009). This method utilizes a comprehensive mutation library made from antigen cDNA, with each plasmid clone containing a unique point mutation and the entire mutation \n\n library covering every amino acid of the antigen coding region. The library of plasmid clones are transfected in HEK-293T or other human cells, and the cells are then arrayed in 384-well microplates. Antibody binding activity is assayed after fixation of cells on the microplate. If amino acid mutations caused a loss of reactivity, it is identified as an antibody binding epitope.\n\n\nCocrystalization of antigen-antibody complex, X-ray diffraction and structural analysis gives direction visualization of antigen-antibody interaction. When combined with amino acid mutagenesis, the technologies would provide powerful evidence and vivid picture for antibody binding epitopes. However, cocrystalization and structural analysis are technically challenging, requires large quantity of purified antigen and antibody, and can be a time-consuming trial and error process.\n\n\nIn order to make an anti Notch-1 antibody that binds to a epitope or a specified set of epitopes, one can generate anti Notch-1 antibodies, then determine the epitope or the set of epitopes that each of these antibodies binds to according to the above mapping method generally known in the art. One can then select those anti Notch-1 antibodies that bind to the specific epitope or the specific set of epitopes.\n\n\nConservative substitution\n\n\nAs discussed previously, an antibody may also be modified recombinantly by conservative substitution of one or more of the amino acid residues of the antibody or by one or more deletions or additions of amino acids to that of the antibody.\n\n\nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an \n\n enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the half-life of the antibody in the blood circulation.\n\n\nSubstitution variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 2. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 2, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n\nTable 2: Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n \n\n Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n(1 ) Non-polar: Norleucine, Met, Ala, VaI, Leu, lie;\n\n\n(2) Polar without charge: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, GIn; (3) Acidic (negatively charged): Asp, GIu;\n\n\n(4) Basic (positively charged): Lys, Arg;\n\n\n(5) Residues that influence chain orientation: GIy, Pro; and\n\n\n(6) Aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe, His.\n\n\nNon-conservative substitutions are made by exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\nAny cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross-linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability, particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment.\n\n\nAffinity matured anti Notch-1 antibodies\n\n\nThe invention includes affinity matured embodiments. For example, affinity matured antibodies can be produced by procedures known in the art (Marks et al. (1992) Bio/Technology, 10:779-783; Barbas et al. (1994) Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91 :3809-3813; Schier et al. (1995) Gene, 169:147-155; Yelton et al. (1995) J. Immunol., 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al. (1995) J. Immunol., 154(7):3310-9; Hawkins et al. (1992) J. MoI. Biol., 226:889-896; and PCT Publication No. WO2004/058184).\n\n\nThe following methods may be used for adjusting the affinity of an antibody and for characterizing a CDR. One way of characterizing a CDR of an antibody and/or altering (such as improving) the binding affinity of a polypeptide, such as an antibody, referred to \"library scanning mutagenesis\". Generally, library scanning mutagenesis works as follows. One or more amino acid positions in the CDR are replaced with two \n\n or more (such 85 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) amino acids using art recognized methods. This generates small libraries of clones (in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity of two or more members (if two or more amino acids are substituted at every position). Generally, the library also includes a clone comprising the native (unsubstituted) amino acid. A small number of clones, e.g., about 20-80 clones (depending on the complexity of the library), from each library are screened for binding affinity to the target polypeptide (or other binding target), and candidates with increased, the same, decreased, or no binding are identified. In some embodiments, every amino acid position in a CDR is replaced, in some embodiments, one at a time, with all 20 natural amino acids using art recognized mutagenesis methods. This generates small libraries of clones, in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed, each with a complexity of 20 members, if all 20 amino acids are substituted at every position. In some embodiments, the library to be screened comprises substitutions in two or more positions, which may be in the same CDR or in two or more CDRs. Thus, the library may comprise substitutions in two or more positions in one CDR. The library may comprise substitution in two or more positions in two or more CDRs. The library may comprise substitution in 3, 4, 5, or more positions, said positions found in two, three, four, five or six CDRs. The substitution may be prepared using low redundancy codons. See, e.g., Table 2 of Balint et al., (1993) Gene 137(1 ):109-18). Each CDR may be a Kabat CDR, a Chothia CDR, or an extended CDR.\n\n\nCandidates with improved binding may be sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution mutant which results in improved affinity, which substitution is also referred to an \"improved\" substitution. Candidates that bind may also be sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution which retains binding.\n\n\nMultiple rounds of screening may be conducted. For example, candidates each comprising an amino acid substitution at one or more position of one or more CDR, with improved binding are also useful for the design of a second library containing at least the original and substituted amino acid at each improved CDR position (i.e., amino acid position in the CDR at which a substitution mutant showed improved binding). Preparation, and screening or selection of this library is discussed further below. \n\n Library scanning mutagenesis also provides a means for characterizing a CDR, in so far as the frequency of clones with improved binding, the same binding, decreased binding or no binding also provide information relating to the importance of each amino acid position for the stability of the antibody-antigen complex. For example, if a position of the CDR retains binding when changed to all 20 amino acids, that position is identified as a position that is unlikely to be required for antigen binding. Conversely, if a position of CDR retains binding in only a small percentage of substitutions, that position is identified as a position that is important to CDR function. Thus, the library scanning mutagenesis methods generate information regarding positions in the CDRs that can be changed to many different amino acids (including all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which cannot be changed or which can only be changed to a few amino acids.\n\n\nCandidates with improved affinity may be combined in a second library, which includes the improved amino acid, the original amino acid at that position, and may further include additional substitutions at that position, depending on the complexity of the library that is desired, or permitted using the desired screening or selection method. In addition, if desired, adjacent amino acid position can be randomized to at least two or more amino acids. Randomization of adjacent amino acids may permit additional conformational flexibility in the mutant CDR, which may in turn, permit or facilitate the introduction of a larger number of improving mutations. The library may also comprise substitution at positions that did not show improved affinity in the first round of screening.\n\n\nThe second library is screened or selected for library members with improved and/or altered binding affinity using any method known in the art, including screening using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis, and selection using any method known in the art for selection, including phage display, yeast display, and hbosome display.\n\n\nPost translational modification of anti Notch-1 antibodies Antibodies can also be modified by post translational modifications, including, but not limited to glycosylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions. The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et \n\n al., 1996, MoI. Immunol. 32:1311 -1318; Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Biochem. 29:4175- 4180) and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein, which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 1996, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of β(1 ,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GIcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (Umana et al., 1999, Mature Biotech. 17:176-180).\n\n\nGlycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The thpeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine, asparagine-X-threonine, and asparagine-X-cysteine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these thpeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above- described thpeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\nThe glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be altered without altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g. antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g. Hse et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070).\n\n\nIn addition to the choice of host cells, factors that affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture \n\n density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261 and 5.278, 299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example, using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), N-glycosidase F, endoglycosidase F1 , endoglycosidase F2, endoglycosidase F3. In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered to be defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art. Other methods of post translational modification include using coupling techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation. Modifications can be used, for example, for attachment of labels for immunoassay.\n\n\nAnti Notch-1 antibodies with modified constant region\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the antibody comprises a modified constant region, such as a constant region that is immunologically inert or partially inert, e.g., does not trigger complement mediated lysis, does not stimulate antibody- dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or does not activate microglia; or have reduced activities (compared to the unmodified antibody) in any one or more of the following: triggering complement mediated lysis, stimulating antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or activating microglia. Different modifications of the constant region may be used to achieve optimal level and/or combination of effector functions. See, for example, Morgan et al., Immunology 86:319-324 (1995); Lund et al., J. Immunology 157:4963-9 157:4963-4969 (1996); ldusogie et al., J. Immunology 164:4178-4184 (2000); Tao et al., J. Immunology 143: 2595-2601 (1989); and Jeffehs et al., Immunological Reviews 163:59-76 (1998). In some embodiments, the constant region is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol. (1999) 29:2613-2624; PCT Application No. PCT/GB99/01441 ; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. In other embodiments, the antibody comprises a human heavy chain lgG2 constant region comprising the following mutations: A330P331 to S330S331 (amino acid numbering with reference to the wild type lgG2 sequence). Eur. J. Immunol. (1999) 29:2613-2624. In still other embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. \n\n In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation by mutating the glycosylated amino acid residue or flanking residues that are part of the N- glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region. For example, N-glycosylation site N297 may be mutated to A, Q, K, or H. See, Tao et al., J. Immunology 143: 2595- 2601 (1989); and Jefferis et al., Immunological Reviews 163:59-76 (1998). In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. The constant region may be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically (such as removing carbohydrate by enzyme PNGase), or by expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell. Modifications within the Fc region can typically be used to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an antibody of the disclosure may be chemically modified {e.g., one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation pattern, again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody. Each of these aspects is described in further detail below. The numbering of residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index of Kabat.\n\n\nIn one case, the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is described further in U.S. Patent No. 5,677,425. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CH1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.\n\n\nIn another case, the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the biological half life of the antibody. More specifically, one or more amino acid mutations are introduced into the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that the antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc-hinge domain SpA binding. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,165,745.\n\n\nIn another case, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half life. Various approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,277,375. Alternatively, to increase the biological half life, the antibody can be altered within the CH1 or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of \n\n a CH2 domain of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121 ,022.\n\n\nIn yet other cases, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector function(s) of the antibody. For example, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues 234, 235, 236, 237, 297, 318, 320 and 322 can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be, for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260.\n\n\nIn another case, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues 329, 331 and 322 can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C1 q binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,194,551.\n\n\nIn another example, one or more amino acid residues within amino acid positions 231 and 239 are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO 94/29351.\n\n\nIn yet another example, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fcγ receptor by modifying one or more amino acids at the following positions: 238, 239, 248, 249, 252, 254, 255, 256, 258, 265, 267, 268, 269, 270, 272, 276, 278, 280, 283, 285, 286, 289, 290, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 298, 301 , 303, 305, 307, 309, 312, 315, 320, 322, 324, 326, 327, 329, 330, 331 , 333, 334, 335, 337, 338, 340, 360, 373, 376, 378, 382, 388, 389, 398, 414, 416, 419, 430, 434, 435, 437, 438 or 439. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO 00/42072. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgGI for FcγR1 , FcγRII, FcγRIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 -6604 (2001 )). Specific mutations at positions 256, 290, 298, 333, 334 and 339 were shown to improve binding to FcγRIII. Additionally, the following combination mutants were shown to improve FcγRIII binding: T256A/S298A, S298A/E333A, S298A/K224A and S298A/E333A/K334A. \n\n In still another example, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861.\n\n\nAdditionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the disclosure to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, the cell lines Ms704, Ms705, and Ms709 lack the fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8 (alpha (1 ,6) fucosyltransferase), such that antibodies expressed in the Ms704, Ms705, and Ms709 cell lines lack fucose on their carbohydrates. The Ms704, Ms705, and Ms709 FUT8\n\"\n'\n\"\n cell lines were created by the targeted disruption of the FUT8 gene in CHO/DG44 cells using two replacement vectors (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004-0110704, and Yamane-Ohnuki et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 87:614-22 (2004)). As another example, European Patent Publication No. EP1 ,176,195 describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation by reducing or eliminating the alpha 1 ,6 bond-related enzyme. EP1 ,176,195 also describe cell lines which have a low enzyme activity for adding fucose to the N-acetylglucosamine that binds to the Fc region of the antibody or does not have the enzyme activity, for example the rat myeloma cell line YB2/0 (ATCC CRL 1662). PCT Publication WO 03/035835 describes a variant CHO cell line, Led 3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also \n\n resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740 (2002)). PCT Publication WO 99/54342 describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases {e.g., beta(1 ,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180 (1999)). Alternatively, the fucose residues of the antibody may be cleaved off using a fucosidase enzyme. For example, the fucosidase alpha-L- fucosidase removes fucosyl residues from antibodies (Tarentino et al., (1975) Biochem. 14:5516-23 (1975)).\n\n\nAnother modification of the antibodies herein that is contemplated by the disclosure is pegylation. An antibody can be pegylated to, for example, increase the biological {e.g., serum) half life of the antibody. To pegylate an antibody, the antibody, or fragment thereof, typically is reacted with polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG, under conditions in which one or more PEG groups become attached to the antibody or antibody fragment. Typically, the pegylation is carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer). As used herein, the term \"polyethylene glycol\" is intended to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used to dehvatize other proteins, such as mono (Ci to Ci\n0\n) alkoxy- or aryloxy- polyethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol-maleimide. In certain cases, the antibody to be pegylated is an aglycosylated antibody. Methods for pegylating proteins are known in the art and can be applied to the antibodies of the present disclosure. See for example, European Patent Nos. EP 0154316B1 and EP 0401384B1. ^^^^^^^B modifications include antibodies that have been modified as described in PCT Publication No. WO 99/58572. These antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding domain directed at the target molecule, an effector domain having an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to all or part of a constant domain of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the target molecule without triggering significant complement dependent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of the target. In some embodiments, the effector domain is capable of specifically binding FcRn and/or FcγRllb. These are typically based on chimeric domains derived from two or more human immunoglobulin heavy chain C\nH\n2 domains. \n\n Antibodies modified in this manner are particularly suitable for use in chronic antibody therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reactions to conventional antibody therapy.\n\n\nFusion protein\n\n\nThe invention also encompasses fusion proteins comprising one or more fragments or regions from the antibodies or polypeptides of this invention. In one embodiment, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acids of the variable light chain region and/or at least 10 amino acids of the variable heavy chain region of the antibodies of the current invention. In other embodiments, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the variable light chain region and/or at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the variable heavy chain region. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises a light chain variable region and/or a heavy chain variable region, of the antibodies of the current invention. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises one or more CDR(s) of the antibodies of the current invention. For purposes of this invention, a fusion protein contains one or more antibodies and another amino acid sequence to which it is not attached in the native molecule, for example, a heterologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another region. Exemplary heterologous sequences include, but are not limited to a \"tag\" such as a FLAG tag or a 6His tag.\n\n\nA fusion polypeptide can be created by methods known in the art, for example, synthetically or recombinantly.\n\n\nBispecific Molecules\n\n\nAn antibody of the disclosure, or antigen-binding portions thereof, can be dehvatized or linked to another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein (e.g., another antibody or ligand for a receptor) to generate a bispecific molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or target molecules. The antibody of the disclosure may in fact be dehvatized or linked to more than one other functional molecule to generate multispecific molecules that bind to more than two different binding sites and/or target molecules; such multispecific molecules are also intended to be \n\n encompassed by the term \"bispecific molecule\" as used herein. To create a bispecific molecule of the disclosure, an antibody of the disclosure can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other binding molecules, such as another antibody, antibody fragment, peptide or binding mimetic, such that a bispecific molecule results.\n\n\nPolynucleotides encoding the anti Notch-1 antibodies\n\n\nThe invention also provides isolated polynucleotides encoding the antibodies and peptides of the invention, and vectors and host cells comprising the polynucleotide. In one aspect, the invention provides compositions, such as a pharmaceutical composition, comprising any of the polynucleotides of the invention. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the antibody of the invention. In other embodiment, the composition comprises an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding any of the antibodies or polypeptides of the invention.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of making any of the polynucleotides described herein.\n\n\nPolynucleotides complementary to any such sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and correspond to a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do not contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support materials.\n\n\nPolynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous sequence that encodes an antibody or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide is not diminished, relative to a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide may generally be assessed as described herein. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably, at least about 80% identity, yet more preferably, at least about 90% identity, and most \n\n preferably, at least about 95% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native antibody or a portion thereof.\n\n\nTwo polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to be \"identical\" if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A \"comparison window\" as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, or 40 to about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned.\n\n\nPreferably, the \"percentage of sequence identity\" is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a window of comparison of at least 20 positions, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less, usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10 to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences.\n\n\nThe percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the reference sequence (i.e. the window size) and multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.\n\n\nVariants may also, or alternatively, be substantially homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA sequence encoding a native antibody (or a complementary sequence).\n\n\nSuitable \"moderately stringent conditions\" include prewashing in a solution of 5 X\n\n\nSSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50°C-65°C, 5 X SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65°C for 20 minutes with each of 2X, 0.5X and 0.2X SSC containing 0.1 % SDS.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"highly stringent conditions\" or \"high stringency conditions\" are those that: (1 ) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example\n\n\n0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50\n0\nC; \n\n (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1 % bovine serum albumin/0.1 % Ficoll/0.1 % polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42°C; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (0.75 M NaCI, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1 % sodium pyrophosphate, 5 x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml), 0.1 % SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42°C, with washes at 42°C in 0.2 x SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55°C, followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55°C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, there are many nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide as described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear minimal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the polynucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are altered as a result of one or more mutations, such as deletions, additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered structure or function. Alleles may be identified using standard techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or database sequence comparison).\n\n\nThe polynucleotides of this invention can be obtained using chemical synthesis, recombinant methods, or PCR. For preparing polynucleotides using recombinant methods, a polynucleotide comprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable vector, and the vector in turn can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and amplification, as further discussed herein. Polynucleotides may be inserted into host cells by any means known in the art. Cells are transformed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide by direct uptake, endocytosis, transfection, F-mating or electroporation. Once introduced, the exogenous polynucleotide can be maintained within the cell as a non-integrated vector (such as a plasmid) or integrated into the host cell genome. The polynucleotide \n\n so amplified can be isolated from the host cell by methods well known within the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. (1989).\n\n\nAlternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA sequences. PCR technology is well known in the art and is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195, 4,800,159, 4,754,065 and 4,683,202, as well as PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction, MuIMs et al. eds., Birkauswer Press, Boston (1994).\n\n\nRNA can be obtained by using the isolated DNA in an appropriate vector and inserting it into a suitable host cell. When the cell replicates and the DNA is transcribed into RNA, the RNA can then be isolated using methods well known to those of skill in the art, as set forth in Sambrook et al., (1989), supra, for example.\n\n\nSuitable cloning vectors may be constructed according to standard techniques, or may be selected from a large number of cloning vectors available in the art. While the cloning vector selected may vary according to the host cell intended to be used, useful cloning vectors will generally have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single target for a particular restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker that can be used in selecting clones containing the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial viruses, e.g., pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript (e.g., pBS SK+) and its derivatives, mp18, mp19, pBR322, pMB9, CoIEI , pCR1 , RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and pAT28. These and many other cloning vectors are available from commercial vendors such as BioRad, Strategene, and Invitrogen.\n\n\nExpression vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide constructs that contain a polynucleotide according to the invention. It is implied that an expression vector must be replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, cosmids, and expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 87/04462. Vector components may generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence; an origin of replication; one or more marker genes; suitable transcriptional controlling elements (such as promoters, enhancers and terminator). For expression (i.e., translation), one or more translational controlling elements are also usually required, such as hbosome binding sites, translation initiation sites, and stop codons. \n\n The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE- dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell.\n\n\nThe invention also provides host cells comprising any of the polynucleotides described herein. Any host cells capable of over-expressing heterologous DNAs can be used for the purpose of isolating the genes encoding the antibody, polypeptide or protein of interest. Non-limiting examples of mammalian host cells include but not limited to COS, HeLa, and CHO cells. See also PCT Publication No. WO 87/04462. Suitable non-mammalian host cells include prokaryotes (such as E. coli or B. subtillis) and yeast (such as S. cerevisae, S. pombe; or K. lactis). Preferably, the host cells express the cDNAs at a level of about 5 fold higher, more preferably, 10 fold higher, even more preferably, 20 fold higher than that of the corresponding endogenous antibody or protein of interest, if present, in the host cells. Screening the host cells for a specific binding to Notch-1 or a Notch-1 domain is effected by an immunoassay or FACS. A cell overexpressing the antibody or protein of interest can be identified.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, containing one or a combination of monoclonal antibodies, or antigen-binding portion(s) thereof, of the present disclosure, formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may include one or a combination of (e.g., two or more different) antibodies, or immunoconjugates or bispecific molecules of the disclosure. For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can comprise a combination of antibodies (or immunoconjugates or bispecifics) that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen or that have complementary activities. Pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure also can be administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy can include an anti-Notch1 antibody of the present disclosure combined with at least one other anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant agent. Examples of \n\n therapeutic agents that can be used in combination therapy are described in greater detail below in the section on uses of the antibodies of the disclosure.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Typically, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, i.e., antibody, antigen-binding portion thereof, immunoconjuage, or bispecific molecule, may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present disclosure may be present in a neutral form (including zwitter ionic forms) or as a positively or negatively-charged species. In some cases, the antibodies may be complexed with a countehon to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Thus, the pharmaceutical compounds of the disclosure may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\nA \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound (e.g. antibody) and does not impart undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1 -19). For example, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" includes a complex comprising one or more antibodies and one or more counterions, where the counterions are derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases.\n\n\nExamples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl- substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, N- methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like. \n\n Furthermore, pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include metallic ions. Metallic ions include, but are not limited to, appropriate alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and other physiological acceptable metal ions. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, manganese, chromium, selenium, tin, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, rubidium, sodium, and zinc, and in their usual valences.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the antibodies of the present disclosure can be prepared from the following acids, including, without limitation formic, acetic, acetamidobenzoic, adipic, ascorbic, boric, propionic, benzoic, camphoric, carbonic, cyclamic, dehydrocholic, malonic, edetic, ethylsulfuhc, fendizoic, metaphosphohc, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, tannic, citric, nitric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, folic, fumaric, propionic, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, lysine, isocitric, thfluoroacetic, pamoic, propionic, anthranilic, mesylic, orotic, oxalic, oxalacetic, oleic, stearic, salicylic, aminosalicylic, silicate, p-hydroxybenzoic, nicotinic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic, sulfonic, methanesulfonic, phosphoric, phosphonic, ethanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, ammonium, benzenesulfonic, pantothenic, naphthalenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, 2- hydroxyethanesulfonic, sulfanilic, sulfuric, nitric, nitrous, sulfuric acid monomethyl ester, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, β-hydroxybutyric, glycine, glycylglycine, glutamic, cacodylate, diaminohexanoic, camphorsulfonic, gluconic, thiocyanic, oxoglutaric, pyhdoxal 5- phosphate, chlorophenoxyacetic, undecanoic, N-acetyl-L-aspartic, galactaric and galacturonic acids.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include trimethylamine, diethylamine, N, N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, dibenzylamine, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), procaine, cyclic amines, quaternary ammonium cations, arginine, betaine, caffeine, clemizole, 2-ethylaminoethanol, 2- diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanediamine, butylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, ethylglucamine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, imidazole, isopropylamine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, pyridine, pyridoxine, neodymium, pipehdine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, thethylamine, thpropylamine, thethanolamine, tromethamine, methylamine, taurine, cholate, 6-amino-2-methyl-2- \n\n heptanol, 2-annino-2-nnethyl-1 ,3-propanediol, 2-amino-2-nnethyl-1 -propanol, aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, strontium, tricine, hydrazine, phenylcyclohexylamine, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino- ths(hydroxymethyl)methane, Λ/-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 1 ,4- piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, 3-morpholino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, 1 ,3- bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 4-(2- hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1 -ethanesulfonic acid, 2-[(2-hydroxy-1 ,1 - bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2- aminoethanesulfonic acid, 4-(N-morpholino)butanesulfonic acid, 3-(Λ/,Λ/-bis[2- hydroxyethyl]amino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-\n\n\n[ths(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-1 -propanesulfonic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine- 1 -(2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid), piperazine-1 ,4-bis(2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid) dihydrate, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1 -piperazinepropanesulfonic acid, Λ/,Λ/-bis(2- hydroxyethyl)glycine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-(4-butanesulfonic acid), N- [ths(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid, N-ths(Hydroxymethyl)methyl- 4-aminobutanesulfonic acid, N-(1 ,1 -dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-3-amino-2- hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid, 3- (cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1 -propanesulfonic acid, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1 - propanesulfonic acid, Λ/-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid, 4-(cyclohexylamino)-1 - butanesulfonic acid, Λ/-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)- 1 ,3-propanediol, and trometamol.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure also may include a pharmaceutically acceptable anti-oxidant. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1 ) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil- soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.\n\n\nExamples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures \n\n thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures, supra, and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\nTherapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. \n\n Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation include, but are not limited to, vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 1 percent to about 30 percent of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nDosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the disclosure are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.\n\n\nFor administration of the antibody, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example \n\n dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1 to 10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once per month, once every 3 months or once every three to 6 months. Dosage regimens for an anti-Notch-1 antibody or antigen binding portion thereof of the disclosure include, for example, 1 mg/kg body weight or 3 mg/kg body weight via intravenous administration, with the antibody being given using one of the following dosing schedules: (i) every four weeks for six dosages, then every three months; (ii) every three weeks; (iii) 3 mg/kg body weight once followed by 1 mg/kg body weight every three weeks.\n\n\nIn some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each antibody administered falls within the ranges indicated. Antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, for example, weekly, monthly, every three months or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of antibody to the target antigen in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of about 1 to 1000 μg/ml and in some methods about 25 to 300 μg/ml.\n\n\nAlternatively, antibody can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody in the patient. In general, human antibodies show the longest half life, followed by humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.\n\n\nActual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular \n\n patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present disclosure employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A \"therapeutically effective dosage\" of an anti-Notch antibody of the disclosure preferably results in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction. For example, for the treatment of Notch-1 -positive tumors, a \"therapeutically effective dosage\" preferably inhibits cell growth or tumor growth by at least about 20%, more preferably by at least about 40%, even more preferably by at least about 60%, and still more preferably by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a compound to inhibit tumor growth can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human tumors. Alternatively, this property of a composition can be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound to inhibit, such inhibition in vitro by assays known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic compound can decrease tumor size, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a subject. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected.\n\n\nA composition of the present disclosure can be administered via one or more routes of administration using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Routes of administration for antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof of the disclosure include intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, spinal or other parenteral routes of administration, for example by injection or infusion. The phrase \"parenteral administration\" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and \n\n topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. Alternatively, an antibody or antigen biding portion thereof of the disclosure can be administered via a non-parenteral route, such as a topical, epidermal or mucosal route of administration, for example, intranasally, orally, vaginally, rectally, sublingually or topically.\n\n\nThe active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.\n\n\nUses and Methods of the Disclosure\n\n\nThe antibodies, particularly the human antibodies, antibody compositions and methods of the present disclosure have numerous in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic utilities involving the diagnosis and treatment of Notch-1 mediated disorders. For example, these molecules can be administered to cells in culture, in vitro or ex vivo, or to human subjects, e.g., in vivo, to treat, prevent and to diagnose a variety of disorders. As used herein, the term \"subject\" is intended to include human and non- human animals. Non-human animals include all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non- mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, cows, horses, chickens, amphibians, and reptiles. Preferred subjects include human patients having disorders mediated by Notch-1 activity. The methods are particularly suitable for treating human patients having a disorder associated with aberrant Notch-1 expression or activation. When antibodies to Notch-1 are administered together with another agent, the two can be administered in either order or simultaneously.\n\n\nGiven the specific binding of the antibodies of the disclosure for Notch-1 , the antibodies of the disclosure can be used to specifically detect Notch-1 expression on the \n\n surface of cells and, moreover, can be used to purify Notch-1 via immunoaffinity purification.\n\n\nFurthermore, the antibodies, antibody compositions and methods of the present disclosure can be used to treat a subject with abnormal cell growth, e.g., a cancer. In one particular embodiment, the cancer is T-ALL. In another particular embodiment, the cancer is breast cancer.\n\n\nOther type of abnormal cell growth that may be treated by the antibodies of the invention include, for example, mesothelioma, hepatobilliary (hepatic and billiary duct), a primary or secondary CNS tumor, a primary or secondary brain tumor, lung cancer (NSCLC and SCLC), bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head or neck, cutaneous or intraocular melanoma, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach cancer, gastrointestinal (gastric, colorectal, and duodenal), breast cancer, uterine cancer, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina, carcinoma of the vulva, Hodgkin's Disease, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system, cancer of the thyroid gland, cancer of the parathyroid gland, cancer of the adrenal gland, sarcoma of soft tissue, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, chronic or acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, lymphocytic lymphomas, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter, renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the renal pelvis, neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS), primary CNS lymphoma, non hodgkins's lymphoma, spinal axis tumors, brain stem glioma, pituitary adenoma, adrenocortical cancer, gall bladder cancer, multiple myeloma, cholangiocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing cancers.. Suitable routes of administering the antibody compositions (e.g., human monoclonal antibodies, multispecific and bispecific molecules and immunoconjugates ) or antigen binding portions thereof of the disclosure in vivo and in vitro are well known in the art and can be selected by those of ordinary skill. For example, the antibody compositions can be administered by injection (e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous). Suitable dosages of the molecules used will depend on the age and weight of the subject and the concentration and/or formulation of the antibody composition.\n\n\nAs previously described, human anti- Notch-1 antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof of the disclosure can be co-administered with one or other more \n\n therapeutic agents, e.g., a cytotoxic agent, a radiotoxic agent or an immunosuppressive agent. The antibody can be linked to the agent (as an immunocomplex) or can be administered separate from the agent. In the latter case (separate administration), the antibody can be administered before, after or concurrently with the agent or can be co- administered with other known therapies, e.g., an anti-cancer therapy, e.g., radiation. Such therapeutic agents include, among others, anti-neoplastic agents such as doxorubicin (adhamycin), cisplatin bleomycin sulfate, carmustine, chlorambucil, and cyclophosphamide hydroxyurea which, by themselves, are only effective at levels which are toxic or subtoxic to a patient. Cisplatin can be intravenously administered as a 100 mg/dose once every four weeks and adriamycin is intravenously administered as a 60 to 75 mg/ml dose once every 21 days. Co-administration of the human anti-Notch-1 antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, of the present disclosure with chemotherapeutic agents provides two anti-cancer agents which operate via different mechanisms which yield a cytotoxic effect to human tumor cells. Such co-administration can solve problems due to development of resistance to drugs or a change in the antigenicity of the tumor cells which would render them unreactive with the antibody.\n\n\nKits\n\n\nAlso within the scope of the present disclosure are kits comprising the antibody compositions of the disclosure (e.g., human antibodies, bispecific or multispecific molecules, or immunoconjugates) and instructions for use. The kit can further contain one ore more additional reagents, such as an immunosuppressive reagent, a cytotoxic agent or a radiotoxic agent, or one or more additional antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof of the disclosure {e.g., a human antibody having a complementary activity which binds to an epitope in the Notch-1 antigen distinct from the first human antibody).\n\n\nAccordingly, patients treated with antibody compositions of the disclosure can be additionally administered (prior to, simultaneously with, or following administration of a human antibody of the disclosure) another therapeutic agent, such as a cytotoxic or radiotoxic agent, which enhances or augments the therapeutic effect of the human antibodies.\n\n\nThe present disclosure is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as further limiting. The contents of all figures and all \n\n references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nExamples Example 1 : Generation and expression of Notchi immunogen Generation of Notch 1 immunogen expression constructs\n\n\nThe immunogen constructs were generated by multiplexing PCR (Fig. 1 ) for monoclonal antibody (mAb) generation. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the Notchi immunogen cDNA was synthesized by multiple overlapping PCR using the Notchi full-length cDNA clone as template (OriGene, Cat. No. TC308883, Rockville, MD) and High Fidelity PCR reagent system following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The recombinant Notchi immunogen cDNA, containing N-terminal leader peptide, EGF-like repeats 35-36, NRR, (including Lin A, B and C domains and the HD domain) and a small portion of intracellular sequence, was cloned in a Fc-fusion protein vector with Notchi immunogen fused to the N-terminus of Fc sequence. The Notchi immunogen plasmid, referred to as NI-NRR-TM(-), contains the cDNA insert shown in sequence 1 in Figure 11 , (SEQ ID NO:1 ), which encodes the immunogen protein shown in sequence 2 in Figure 11 ( SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\nA similar plasmid was constructed in parallel as shown in Fig. 2, which contains the same sequence as NI -NRR-TM(-) except that the transmembrane (TM) sequence\n\n\n(the last 24 amino acid residues in Sequence 4) was used to replace the intracellular sequence (the last 44 amino acid residues in Sequence 2) of NI -NRR-TM(-). This\n\n\nPCR-amplified Notchi immunogen cDNA was cloned in pcDNA3.1 D/V5-His (Invitrogen).\n\n\nThe plasmid was referred to as N1 -NRR-TM(+). The nucleic acid sequence and amino acid sequence of N1 -NRR-TM(+) is shown as Sequence 3 (SEQ ID NO:3) and 4 (SEQ\n\n\nID NO:4) in Figure 12.\n\n\nExpression and purification of Notch 1 immunogen protein\n\n\nNI -NRR-TM(-) was expressed in Freestyle™ 293-F cells (Invitrogen, Inc., Calsbad, CA) by transient transfection using Freestyle™ Max Reagent (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's protocol, verified by Western blot analysis. Briefly, 1 X 10\n7\n cells were seeded in a tissue culture shaker flask containing 30 milliliters (ml) of 293-F cell growth medium (Invitrogen). The secreted protein was analyzed by taking an aliquot of 0.5 ml \n\n conditioned medium every 24 hours from day 2 to day 7 after transfection. Twenty microliters (ul) of conditioned medium and 2X protein sample loading buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA) were combined, heated at 100\n0\nC for 5 minutes. The samples were separated through electrophoresis in a 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). The proteins were transferred from gel to blotting membrane using a dry blotting device (Invitrogen), then the membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% tween-20) for one hour. Detection of N1-MRRHD-TM(-)/Fc fusion proteins was performed by incubation with human γFc-specific, HRP-conjugated antibody (Bethyl Lab. Inc. Montgomery, TX). The membrane was washed three times in PBST before developing with Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The protein expression time course study showed that the conditioned medium of 5-6 day culture contains most secreted N1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc fusion protein. Therefore, N1 -NRR- TM(-)/Fc protein expression was scaled up in 10 liters of culture volume, and the protein was purified through protein G affinity column (Invitrogen).\n\n\nEstablishing cell lines expressing Notchi immunogen\n\n\nN1 -NRR-TM(+) was stably transfected in a mouse cell line, L-929 (ATCC, CCL-1 , Manassas, VA), expressed as cell surface membrane-anchored protein. The stable cell line was established by transfection using LipoFectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), and the cells were selected against 1 mg/ml of neomycin (G418) for about 9-15 days until individual colonies were visible by eye and picked up for clonal growth. The expression level of N1 -NRR-TM(+)A/5 protein was assessed by Western blot using protein extract made from each stable transfection clone. More specifically, cells of each clone were removed from culture vessels, rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to Western blot analysis described as above. The protein was detected by HRP-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). The cell clones expressing highest level of N1-NRR-TM(+) protein was selected for the use of immunization and cell-based antibody binding assay.\n\n\nExample 2: Generation of Notch 1 mAb\n\n\nImmunization and hybhdoma cloning\n\n\nBalb/c mice were immunized using human Notchi immunogen, NI -NRR-TM(-), and a long immunization protocol. The first immunization was given via subcutaneous \n\n (sc) injection with twenty micrograms (μg) of the antigen mixed in Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) emulsion, followed by three biweekly sc injections with each delivering 20 μg of antigen mixed in Incomplete Freunds Adjuvant (IFA) emulsion. The serum was taken a week after fourth antigen injection to check the titer of antibodies by ELISA. The mouse with high response titer was euthanized, and the spleen was surgically removed for hybhdoma cloning.\n\n\nA single cell suspension of spleenocytes were prepared by forcing the spleen through a 100-micron stainless steel screen, then through a cell strainer, and wash twice in 30ml RPMI. The spleenocytes were mixed with Sp2/0-Ag14 cells (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in three to one ratio, and cell fusion was facilitated by adding 50% PEG- 1500 and gentle stirring. The mixture of cells were precipitated by centrifugation, and gently washed with RPMI, followed by incubation in RPMI-1640 medium with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37\n0\nC for 30 minutes. The cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 containing 20% FCS, standard HAT (hypoxanthine, aminoptehn and thymidine), 25% spleen-conditioned medium, 2 mM glutamate and 100ug/ml Pen-Strip, (Invitrogen; Calsbad, CA), dispensed in 96-well plates and cultured in 37°C/5%CO\n2\n incubator for 8 to 20 days to allow HAT-resistant hybridoma clones established. The conditioned media from each hybridoma clone were subjected to ELISA screening.\n\n\nELISA screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAb)\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) were performed using Nunc™ MaxiSorp 96-well plates (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rochester, NY), which were prepared in two sets: the positive test plates coated overnight with 100 ng of N1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc protein in each well and the negative control plates coated with 100 ng of human Fc protein. Conditioned media from hybridoma clones were screened for their ability to bind N1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc protein. One hundred microliters of each hybridoma supernatant were added to the coated plates, and incubated at room temperature for one hour. The wells were washed three times with PBST (1 X PBS with containing 0.05% Tween-20). Horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat-anti-mouse Fc antibody was added to detect the mAbs bound to the antigen. Excessive HRP was washed off by three times of washes with PBST, 200 μl per well for each wash. ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis-[3- ethyibenzthiazQϋne-6-sulfonic acid]) solution was then added as substrate for HRP color development. The reaction was stopped and plates were scanned by a plate reader at \n\n 405nm. Positive wells were re-screened with N1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc protein -coated plates and counter-screened with human Fc-coated plates in the same manner as described above. The hybridoma mAbs only binding to N1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc protein but not to human Fc were true Notchi -binding antibodies, which were selected to proceed for functional screening.\n\n\nExample 3: Identification and characterization of Notchi -antagonist mAb Establishing luciferase reporter assay cell lines Luciferase reporter assay was commonly used to assess Notch 1 receptor- mediated signaling and transcriptional activity in a variety of settings (Weng, A. P., et. al, Science, 2004, 9265-9273; Osipo et al., Oncogene, 2008, 27(37):5019-5032). For assaying ligand-induced Notchi activation and mAb inhibition, the tool cell lines were developed to enhance Notch signaling. It was well established that the active form of Notch receptor consisting of intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus, and forms complex with CSL [named after CBF1 , Su(H) and LAG-1] binding factor 1 , which binds to the core sequence called CSL-binding motif in a gene promoter region, activating the downstream gene transcription (Bray, 2006). Based on those discoveries, the Notchi - mediated luciferase reporter plasmid was generated. Briefly, a concatamers of eight CSL binding motifs as described by Tun et al. (Tun et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1994m 22(6):965-971 ) were inserted in the multiple cloning site of pTA-Luc (BD Biosiences, Palo Alto, CA). A hygromycin selection marker (see next paragraph) was added to the down stream of luciferase gene. This yielded the luciferase reporter plasmid, CSLuc.\n\n\nThe full length Notch 1 expression construct was obtained from OriGene (Rockville, MD) and verified by sequencing as identical to NM_017617.2 (NCBI/GenBank accession number). A hygromycin selection marker with SV40 promoter was PCR-synthesized from pcDNA3.1 /Hygromycin (Invitrogen), and connected to a growth hormone 3' poly-A signaling sequence from pcDNA5/RFTA/5-His (Invitrogen) by standard PCR joining method. The completed hygromycin marker was inserted in the CIa I site of the Notchi expression plasmids. This plasmid is renamed as Notch1/Hyg. To enhance Notchi activity, PEDT domain (Weng, A.P., et. al, Science, 2004, 9265-9273 et. al.) was deleted from Notch1/Hyg by site-directed mutagenesis (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ). The resulting plasmid was named as Notchi -dPEST. Human Jaggedi cDNA plasmid was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). \n\n Jaggedi coding region was PCR-synthesized, and inserted into pcDNA3.3-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen).\n\n\nNotch 1 -dependent assay cell lines were generated by cotransfecting Notch1/hyg and CSLuc plasmids into U2-OS (ATCC Number HTB-96, Manassas, VA) cells, or by cotransfecting NotcM-dPEST and CSLuc into 293T (ATCC Number CRL-11268, Manassas, VA) cells using LipoFectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Stably-transfected cells were clonally selected against 200-800 μg/ml hygromycin in DMEM growth medium (Invitrogen), the cell clones were screened by Western blot analysis as described in Example 1 and by luciferase reporter assay described in following sections. A cell line with relatively high level of Notchi expression (based on Western blot) and Delta like-4 (DII4)-induced luciferase activity was selected for use in functional assay. Two such example cell lines are U2-OS/Notch1 -CSLuc (nick name: N1 CU3) and 293/Notch1 -dPEST-CSLuc (nick name: N1dP-c16). Through similar procedure, a cell line stably-expressing human Jaggedi was generated from a parental cell line, HeIa (ATCC number CCL-2). The cell line was named as Hela/JAG1.\n\n\nLuciferase reporter assay and identification of Notch 1-antogonist hybhdoma clones\n\n\nFor identifying Notchi -inhibitory hybhdoma clones, luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess DII4-induced Notchi activity in N1 CU3 cells. The 96-well tissue culture plates (BD Bioscience) were coated with 50 to 100 nanograms (ng) of recombinant DII4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) per well. N1 CU3 cells were seeded at 50,000 cells per well in the DII4- or BSA-coated plates, 30 to 50 ul of conditioned media from hybhdoma clones were added at same time, and cultured for 24 to 40 hours. At the end of the culture, cells were directly lysed in 1 X Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wl) after removing all medium, and luciferase reporter activities were assayed using Bhght-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System following manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, Wl) and MicroLumat Plus LB 96V luminometer (Berthhold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Hybridoma supernatants with statistically significant inhibition to DII4-induced Notch reporter activity were subjected to affinity purification through Protein-G column (Pierce, Rockford, IL) following manufacturer's protocol. The purified mAb were further analyzed by luciferase reporter assays again to confirm the inhibitory function to Notchi -dependent signaling. \n\n Characterization of the anti-Notch1 mAb by luciferase reporter assays Among the mAbs inhibiting Notch 1 -mediated signaling, one mAb (N248A) showed the most potent inhibitory activity, which was characterized in detail through several different luciferase reporter assays. Figure 3 shows that mAb N248A had much higher potency inhibiting DII4 ligand-induced Notchi signaling than that of companion mAb, mAb-C when DII4 was coated on the surface of culture plate to induce Notch signaling. The 293/Notch1 -dPEST-CSLuc cells were used in the assay. The y-axis numbers are luciferase reporter activity readings.\n\n\nTo assess whether mAb N248A can inhibit other Notch ligand-induced signaling, Hela/Jagged1 cells and N1dP-c16 cells were co-cultured and luciferase reporter assay as described above was performed. mAb N248A indeed completely inhibited Jaggedi - induced Notchi signaling (Figure 4).\n\n\nExample 4: Determining Antibody Binding Affinity\n\n\nThe physical binding affinity of anti-Notch1 mAb N248A, to Notchi antigen was measured on a surface plasmon resonance Biacore 3000 instrument equipped with a research -grade sensor chip (Chip type: CM5) using HBSP running buffer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden - now GE Healthcare) plus 1 mM CaC^. Protein A was amine- coupled at saturating levels onto the chip using a standard N- hydroxysuccinimide/ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (NHS/EDC) chemistry. N1 - NRR-TM(-)Fc protein (described in Example 1 ) was captured to the chip surface by Protein A in all three flow cells at 40, 13, 4 ug/ml. Anti-Notch1 mAb N248A was diluted in a 3-fold series, injected for 1 min at 100 μl/min. Dissociation was monitored for 20 minutes. The chip was regenerated after the last injection of each titration with two 30 second pulses of 100 mM phosphoric acid. Buffer cycles provided blanks for double- referencing the data, which were then fit globally to a simple binding model using Biaevaluation software v.4.1. Affinities were deduced from the quotient of the kinetic rate constants (K\n0\n = Wk\n0n\n). The data show that mAb N248A has K\n0n\n = 5.19e-5 (Ms), K\nOff\n <1.7e-4 (1/s) and K\n0\n < 0.33 nM. The tight K\n0\n is contributed both by fast K\n0n\n and very slow K\nOff\n, which is slower than that resolvable by our assay (Refer to 5% rule, Biacore 3000 manual). \n\n Example 5: Analysis of Notchi -antagonist mAb binding epitopes\n\n\nMapping mAb binding epitopes by domain swap with human Notch2\n\n\nFor understanding the mechanism of action by Notchi -antagonist mAb, binding epitopes of Notchi -antagonist mAbs were analyzed by domain swap and ELISA binding assay. The Notch1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc protein was divided into six domains: EGF (including\n\n\nEGF35-36), Lin12-A (or Lin-A), Lin-B, Lin-C, heterodimehzation domain-N (or HD-N) and HD-C (Figure 5). Each of the domains were swapped for that corresponding to human Notch2 by PCR synthesis in a series of chimeric Notch1 -NRR-TM(-)/Fc expression constructs. The domain-swap plasmids were transfected in Freestyle™ 293- F cells (Invitrogen, Inc., Calsbad, CA) using Freestyle™ Max Reagent (Invitrogen) as described above in Example 1. After being cultured for three days, the conditioned media was subjected to Western blot analysis and an ELISA binding assay by Notchi mAbs. Western blot (method as in Example 1 ) showed that five of the six domain-swap constructs expressed well except that Lin-B/Notch2 swap was poorly expressed.\n\n\nIn ELISA assay, the 100 microliters of the conditioned medium from the above antigen plasm ids-transfected cell culture were loaded in each well of the 96-well plate, and plates were incubated at room temperature for 4 hours or 4\n0\nC for overnight. The condition medium was then removed from the coated plates. For primary antibody binding, 300ng of each mAb (Table 3) in 100 microliters of PBS was added to the coated well. The rest of the ELISA procedure is the same as described in Example 2. The mAb N99a, N326A and N440A were monoclonal antibodies that bind to Notch-1 , generated and isolated by the same procedures of that of mAb N248A. As shown in Table 3, binding of mAb N248A to the chimeric antigens was completely abolished when Lin-A or HD-C domain was swapped to corresponding Notch2 domain. On the other hand, swapping of EGF, Lin-C or HD-C domain did not affect its binding. The mAbs N326A and N440A were distinctly different from mAb N248A. These two mAbs require HD-N and HD-C domains for their binding activity. N99A is somewhat similar to mAb N248A in that its binding requires Lin-A and HD-C domains. However, swap of the HD-N domain also reduced N99A binding activity. These data supported the conclusion that mAb N248A has at least two distinguishable sets of binding epitopes, one in Lin-A domain and the other in HD-C domain. Whether there is another epitope in Lin-B domain was resolved in a separate experiment. Similarly, all the other three Notchi - \n\n antagonist mAbs have two identifiable sets of binding epitopes, one in the HD-C domain and the other in the domains of Notchi N-terminal subunit. Based on the recently published crystal structures of Notchi (Gordon, WR et al., Blood, 2009, Volume 113, 4381 -4390) and Notch2 (Gordon et al., Nature Structure Molecular Biology, 2007, Volume 14, 295-300) NRR regions, the three Lin12 domains are wrapped around the HD domains, blocking random cleavage and activation by ADAM protease, and therefore maintaining the receptor in non-active or silent status. The mAb N248A binds to Notch 1 at two distinct sets of epitopes, causing the Notch 1 to be locked down in the silent conformation, and thus preventing the receptor from being activated by its ligands. Notchi gene mutations, mostly point mutations and some small deletions and insertions, have been reported in more than 50% of T-ALL (Weng, A. P., et. al, Science, 2004, 9265-9273; Malecki et al., Molecular Cell Biology, 2006, 26(12):4642-4651 ). The mutations are clustered in two regions: one in the C-terminus of the intracellular moiety and the other in the HD-N domain. These findings support the notion that mAb N248A would have better therapeutic utility in T-ALL than the other three mAbs listed in Table 3 because the HD-N domain swap did not affect the binding of mAb N248A to Notchi while the binding of the other three was affected (see Table 3).\n\n\nTable 3. ELISA reading of Notchi mAb binding to chimeric antigens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN248A binds to human Notchi , but not mouse Notchi \n\n To locate the binding epitopes of N248A1 , we generated murine Notchi-NRRHD expression plasmids containing mouse Notchi cDNA coding region from nucleotide 1 - 99 and nucleotide 4327 to 5169 (NCBI Accession #, NM_008714), and performed transient transfection and ELISA binding assay (methods described in previous sections, Example 1 and 5). The results showed that N248A1 does not bind to mouse Notchi , and only binds to human Notchi (Table 4). We further made domain-swap chimeric Notchi -NRRHD expression constructs using the human Notchi -NRRHD sequence (Nucleotide 1 -129 and 4338-5202, NCBI Accession # NM_017617) as frame work, systematically exchanged the human Lin-A, Lin-B or HD-C domains with the corresponding mouse domains. An ELISA binding assay using this human/mouse domain swap protein as bait demonstrated that the binding of N248A1 to human Notchi antigen is abolished when the Lin-A domain is exchanged to mouse sequence while the Lin-B or HD-C domain exchange did not affect the binding. In contrast, the other control mAb, 22F7, loses binding only when Lin-B is exchanged to the mouse sequence. Therefore, the binding epitope that determines whether N248A1 only binds to human Notchi , not to mouse, is located in the Lin-A domain.\n\n\nTable 4. ELISA readings of Notchi mAb binding to human, mouse and chimeric antigens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify binding epitope of N248A1 in Lin-A domain\n\n\nTo identify binding epitope of N248A1 in the Lin-A domain, we mutated the two amino acids which are different between the human and mouse Lin-A domains, i.e. \n\n 1457E/A and 1465S/N, (Table 5). ELISA results showed that mutation 1457E/A did not affect the binding, but mutation 1465S/N abolished the binding, indicating that amino acid Asn (N) in mouse Lin-A is the sole amino acid residue responsible for blocking N248A1 binding to mouse Notchi . Several amino acids surrounding 1465S were mutated to alanine sequentially (Table 5). Mutation of 1463V/A, 1466L/A or 1467Q/A also abolished the N248A1 binding. However, the control mAb A2 was not affected by the mutations 1463V/A or 1465S/N (Table 5). These experiments demonstrated that the binding epitope of N248A1 in Lin-A involves 1463V, 1465S, 1466L and 1467Q.\n\n\nTable 5. Analysis of N248A1 point mutation and ELISA binding activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify binding epitope of N248A1 in HD-C domain A serial of five sub-domain swap chimeric antigens (Table 6) were generated by sequentially swapping clusters of amino acids from Notchi sequence to Notch2 sequence. ELISA results showed that the sub-domain swap-1 significantly reduced N248A1 binding while the other four subdomain swap antigens does not affect N248A1 binding. On the other hand, the parallel control mAb 19H7 showed significant binding affinity reduction on sub-domain swap 1 , 3 and 5 (Table 6). All the subdomain swap antigen expression and secretion in conditioned media was confirmed by Western blot \n\n analysis (Methods in above). All subdomain swap antigens except subdomain swap 5 have equal or higher expression than human Notchi -NRRHD (huN1 -NRRHD) protein. The subdomain swap 5 expressed at about 50% level of huN1 -NRRHD based on Western blot band intensity comparison (data not shown). These experiments showed that the binding epitope of N248A1 in HD-C includes five amino acids, 1705G, 1706A, 1707L, 1709S and 1710L (human Notchi coding cDNA sequence, NCBI accession # NM_017617), as highlighted in Table 6.\n\n\nTable 6.

Cancer, 1978, 21 (2):166-70), and obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). This cell line harbors a Notchi mutation that leads to high level of Notchi intracellular domain (NICD), the active form of Notchi , as a result of enhanced gamma secretase cleavage. For growth inhibition assays, HPB-ALL cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 10,000 cell/well in RPMM 640 media supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Serially diluted mAb N248A or D16A was added at beginning, and cells were cultured at 37\n0\nC for 7 day. At the end of the \n\n culture, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mg/ml of Resazurin (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the cells, and the plates were incubated at 37\n0\nC for 4 hours. Fluorescent signals were read through dual filters with excitation = 560 nm and emission = 590 nm. IC\n50\n values were calculated using the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La JoIIa, CA).\n\n\nFor in vitro NICD analysis, HPB-ALL cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 x 10\n6\n cells per well and cultured in RPMH 640 with 10% FCS (Invitrogen). mAb N248A or control antibody D16A was added to the culture at variable concentrations as indicated in Figure 6. Cells were cultured in the presence of antibodies at 37\n0\nC for 24 hours. They were then collected and lysed in cold 1X Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, Boston MT). Proteins were extracted from cell lysate by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minute at 4\n0\nC. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The level of NICD in each sample was determined by western blot analysis. In each western blot analysis, about 50 μg of lysate was resolved by electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which was subjected to immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-NICD antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) and mouse α actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). IRDye 680 or 800 conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used to visualize the Western blot bands. The images were analyzed using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).\n\n\nThe results demonstrated that inhibition of HPB-ALL cell growth by mAb N248A is correlated to the reduction of NICD levels. At 24 hours of treatment, mAb N248A reduced NICD levels in a dose dependent manner, the highest reduction was observed at 30μg/mL. After 7 days of treatment, mAb N248A caused significant inhibition of cell growth. IC50 value for the cell growth inhibition is approximately 0.78 μg/ml or -5.2 nM.\n\n\nInhibition of breast cancer cell growth\n\n\nIt was well documented that expression of Notch 1 was aberrantly increased in breast cancer (Reedijk et al. Cancer Research, 2005, 65(18):8530-8537; Klinakis et al., 2006; Efstratiadis et al., Cell Cycle, 2007, 6(4):418-429) which was associated to poor \n\n survival rate (Reedijk et al. Cancer Research, 2005, 65(18):8530-8537). In transgenic mice expressing the activated form of Notchi in mammary tissue, almost all the mice developed breast cancer by one year (Hu et al., American Journal of Pathology, 2006, 168(3):973-990). To test the hypothesis that blocking Notch 1 -mediated signaling would inhibits breast cancer cell growth, several breast cancer cell lines were cultured in presence of 10μg/ml mAb N248A antibody, Herceptin (Genentech/Roche, South San Francisco, CA) or control mouse immunoglobulin G (mlgG). All the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 1 % FCS for two to three days. The viable cells was quantified by Cell Titer Glow™ (Promega), and scanned by MicroLumat Plus LB 96V luminometer (Berthhold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). To the same panel of breast cancer cells, expression of Notch 1 and Jagged 1 on cell surface was analyzed by FACS. The results demonstrated that the growth inhibition of the breast cancer cells by mAb N248A is roughly correlated to Notchi and Jaggedi expression level. mAb N248A exerts the strongest inhibition to MDA-MB-231 cells, which expresses relatively high level of Notchi and Jaggedi . Interestingly, BT475 cell-derived, Heceptin-resistant cell line, BT475HR, showed increased expression of Notchi and Jaggedi comparing to parental BT475 cell line. mAb N248A inhibited BT475HR cell growth, while Heceptin did not. The data indicated potential utility of mAb N248A in therapeutic treatment of breast cancer which has increased expression of Notchi or resistant to current drug, Heceptin. Table 7. Tumor cell growth inhibition assay of anti-Notch1 mAb, N248A.\n\n\nExpression index represents fold increase of FACS geometric mean after the breast cancer cells were immuno-stained with anti-Notch1 or anti-Jagged1 antibody. Relative cell proliferation index stands for percentage of control cell cultured in parallel without adding any agent. BT-474HR is Herceptin-resistant cell line derived from BT-474 (ATCC).\n\n\nTable 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo confirm that the growth inhibition of breast cancer cell by N248A is mediated by block Notch signaling, the expression of two well-known Notch down-stream target genes was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in presence of N248A or control mAb for two days, and then harvested to isolate total RNA using RNAeasy reagent kit and protocol (Qiagen). The results demonstrated that mAb N248A indeed blocked HES1 and HES4 expression (Figure 7), confirming the mechanism of action by N248A.\n\n\nExample 7: Notchi mAb inhibits T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in murine xenograft tumor model\n\n\nT-ALL tumor growth inhibition by Notchi mAb\n\n\nFor establishing mouse model T-ALL xenograft model, immune-compromised athymic female Nude (Nu/Nu) mice (average at 20 grams, 6-8 weeks old), were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions following the guidelines of the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International. Animals were provided sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum. All in vivo studies were carried out under approved institutional experimental animal care and use protocols.\n\n\nHBP-ALL Cells were harvested from fresh culture before implanting in host mice, and washed once and re-suspended in sterile, serum-free medium. The cell suspension was adjusted appropriate density and supplemented with 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) to facilitate tumor take. A total of 5-10 x 10\n6\n cells in 200 μL were implanted subcutaneously into the hind-flank region of the mouse and allowed to grow to the designated size prior to the administration of antibody for each experiment. For anti-tumor efficacy study, animals bearing HPB-AII tumors of 150-300 mm\n3\n in size were randomized and divided into four groups receiving N248A at 1 mg, 3 mg and 10 mg per kilogram (kg) respectively, or receiving control antibody D16A at 5 mg per kg. The mAbs were injected subcutaneously once a week for 2 weeks. Animal body weight and tumor measurements were obtained every 2-3 days. Tumor volume (mm\n3\n) was \n\n measured with Vernier calipers and calculated using the formula: length (mm) x width (mm) x width (mm) x 0.4. The tumor volumes of drug-treated and vehicle-treated mice on the final day of study were used to calculate percent (5) inhibition values as 100- {1 - [(Treated Final day - Treated Day i)/(Control\nF\nιnai day - Control Day i)]}- For all tumor growth inhibition (TGI) experiments, 8 to 10 mice per dose group were used. A Student's t test was used to determine the P.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 8, Notchi mAb, N248A, demonstrated robust antitumor activity in this model after 11 days' treatment, i.e. two weekly doses. The average tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in the 10 mg/kg group versus control mAb group is more than 77 %, which is highly significant in statistical term (P<0.01 ). TGI was roughly dose- dependent with an exception that the two lower dose groups, 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, are too close to differentiate. The exact causes for this observation are unclear though it is likely due to high variability in tumor size of this model. N248A, as a human Notchi- specific inhibitor, was well-tolerated in mice, without causing significant weight loss, morbidity or mortality in any treatment groups.\n\n\nPharmacokinetics and pharmocodvnamics (PK/PD) of Notchi mAb in mice For PK/PD study, mice bearing tumors with size ranging 300-800 mm\n3\n were administered a single dose of N248A at 5 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection. After administration of N248A mice were euthanized at time points of 6, 16 hours, and 1 , 2, 3, 5 days. Blood samples were drawn from the left cardiac ventricle using a syringe and transferred to tubes primed with heparin sulfate. In the meantime, the tumors were taken out by resection, snap-frozen and homogenized in cold 1X Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, Boston MT). Proteins were extracted from the tumor lysate and the level of NICD in each tumor sample was determined using western blot analysis described above. The blood samples were subject to centrifugation to separate serum from blood cells. The serum level of N248A was assessed by ELISA method as described in Example 2. The ELISA plate was first coated with human Fc-specific mAb, which captures Notch 1 -N RR-TM (-)/Fc antigen. The Notchi antigen in turn binds to Notchi mAb, N248A, in sera.\n\n\nThe PK curve indicated that N248A mAb reached maximum concentration (-235 nM) in mouse sera 24 hours after injection. The estimated half life is about 4.5 days (Figure 9). Evaluation of the direct marker for Notchi activation (i.e. NICD) showed that \n\n the tumor samples harvested from mice treated with N248A had a robust NICD reduction, which persisted until five days post dosing (Figure 10). In contrast, the control mAb, D16A, did not reduce NICD level (data not shown). The maximal inhibition of NICD by N248A at 5 mg/kg was approximately 80%.\n\n\nExample 8: Cloning and sequences of Notchi mAb, N248A\n\n\nThe sequences of the variable regions of mAb N248A was determined. The antibody IgG subtype was first assessed using an lsosthp Mouse Monoclonal Antibody kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The results indicated that N248A has an IgGi heavy chain and a lambda light chain. For cloning and sequencing of mAb N248A, 1 x 10\n6\n hybhdoma cells were harvested and lysed to isolate total cellular RNA using RNeasy Mini Reagent kit and manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The first strand cDNA was synthesized on the RNA templates using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (InVitrogen). The cDNAs of the variable regions of light chain and heavy chain were amplified by PCR from the first strand cDNA using degenerate forward primers complimentary to the 5'-end of mouse lambda chain coding sequence and a reverse primer matching the constant region adjacent to the 3'-end of the variable region, or using degenerate forward primers complementary to the 5'-end of mouse IgGI heavy chain coding sequence and a respective IgGI constant region reverse primer. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 96 C for 1 minute, followed by 40 cycles at 95 \n°\nC for 20 sec, 50 \n°\nC for 20 sec, and 72 \n°\nC for 30 second. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR-4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), sequenced by conventional methods, and analyzed using Vector NTI Advance software, (InVitrogen). The cloned antibody sequences were confirmed by direct comparison with the N- terminal sequences obtained from purified hybridoma-derived antibody, as determined by Mass spectrometry (Univ. of CA, Davis, Molecular Structure Facility). The compiled sequence results demonstrated that the variable region of mAb N248A heavy chain contains 121 amino acid residues, and the light chain contains 109 amino acid residues. Further analysis of the N248A mAb V\nH\n sequence and V\nL\n sequence using the Kabat system of CDR region determination led to the delineation of the heavy chain CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3 and light change CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3 of mAb N248A are shown in Figure 15 as sequences 15-20 (SEQ ID NO: 15-20). The \n\n nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the light chain variable region CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3 of mAb N248A are shown in Figure 14 as sequences 9-14 (SEQ ID NO: 9- 14). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region of mAb N248A are shown in Figure 13 as sequences 5-8 (SEQ ID NO: 5-8)."

Description\n\n\n\n\n STABILIZED INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR POLYPEPTIDES\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nInsulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are part of a complex system that cells use to communicate with their physiologic environment. This complex system (often referred to as the insulin-like growth factor axis) consists of two cell-surface receptors (IGF-IR and IGF-2R), two ligands (IGF-I and IGF-2), a family of six high-affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP 1-6), and associated IGFBP degrading enzymes (proteases). This system is important not only for the regulation of normal physiology but also for a number of pathological states (Glass, Nat Cell Biol 5:87-90, 2003).\n\n\nThe IGF axis has been shown to play roles in the promotion of cell proliferation and the inhibition of cell death (apoptosis). IGF-I is mainly secreted by the liver as a result of stimulation by human growth hormone (hGH). Almost every cell in the human body is affected by IGF-I, especially cells in muscles, cartilage, bones, liver, kidney, nerves, skin and lungs. In addition to the insulin-like effects, IGF-I can also regulate cell growth. IGF-I and IGF-2 are regulated by a family of gene products known as the IGF-binding proteins. These proteins help to modulate IGF action in complex ways that involve both inhibiting IGF action by preventing binding to the IGF receptors as well as promoting IGF action through aiding delivery to the receptors and increasing IGF half life in the blood stream. There are at least six characterized binding proteins (IGFBP 1-6).\n\n\nIn its mature form, human IGF-I (gpetlcgaelvdalqfvcgdrgfyfnkptgygsssrrapqtgivdeccfrscdlrrlem ycaplkpaksa; SEQ ID NO:1), also called somatomedin, is a small protein of 70 amino acids that has been shown to stimulate growth of a wide range of cells in culture. The mature protein is initially encoded by three known splice variant mRNAs. The open reading frame of each mRNA encodes a precursor protein containing the 70 amino acid IGF-I and a particular E-peptide at the C-terminus, depending on the particular IGF-I mRNA. These E-peptides have been termed the Ea (rsvraqrhtdmpktqkevhlknasrgsagnknyrm; SEQ ID NO:2), Eb (rsvraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnknt ksqrrkgwpkthpggeqkegteaslqirgkkkeqrreigsrnaecrgkkgk; SEQ ID NO:3), and Ec (rsvraqrhtdm pktqkyqppstnkntksqrrkgstfeerk; SEQ ID NO:4) peptides and range from 35 to 87 amino acids in \n\n length and encompass a common sequence region at the N-terminus and a variable sequence region at the C-terminus. For example, the wild-type open reading frame for the IGF-I-Ea encodes a polypeptide of 105 amino acids (gpetlcgaelvdalqfvcgdrgfyfnkptgygsssrrapqtgivde ccfrscdlrrlemycaplkpaksa rsvraqrhtdmpktqkevhlknasrgsagnknyrm; SEQ ID NO: 5). In physiological expression, the E-peptides are cleaved off of the precursor by endogenous proteases to yield the mature 70 amino acid IGF-I known to be bioactive. In certain contexts, one to three of the N-terminal amino acids of IGF-I are known to be cleaved under physiological conditions, yielding active IGF-I having between 67-70 amino acids. IGF-2 gene expression and processing is characterized by similar attributes except that only one E-peptide (rdvstpptvlpdnfprypvgkffqydtwkqstqrlrrglpallrarrghvlakeleafreakrhrplialptqdpahggappemasnrk; SEQ ID NO:6) for human IGF-2 has been identified for the 156 amino acid precursor (ayφsetlcggelvdtlqfvcgdrgfyfsφasrvsrrsrgiveeccfrscdlalletycatpakserdvstpptvlpdnfprypvgkffqy dtwkqstqrlrrglpallrarrghvlakeleafreakrhφlialptqdpahggappemasnrk; SEQ ID NO:7). Both IGF-I and IGF-2 appear to be poor drug candidates, since these proteins are quickly degraded by endogenous proteases in the serum of patients. One strategy that has been contemplated is to stabilize IGF-I as a drug by forming a complex with one of its binding proteins.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention The invention is based on the discovery that a precursor IGF-I or IGF-2 protein containing substantially its E-peptide is bioactive and stabilized in the presence of serum, resulting in an IGF-I or IGF-2 polypeptide that is useful as a pharmaceutical. In the compositions of the invention, the normal cleavage of the E-peptide from IGF-I is avoided, for example, by mutating or deleting either of the arginine at position 1 or the serine at position 2 of the E-peptides (corresponding to positions 71 and 72 in the wild-type precursor IGF-I). In IGF-2, the cleavage is avoided, for example, by mutating or deleting either the arginine at position 1 or the aspartic acid at position 2 of the E-peptide (corresponding to positions 68 and 69 in the wild-type precursor IGF-2). Other modifications of an IGF precursor protein can avoid or reduce this cleavage.\n\n\nIn addition, further modifications of the IGF-I precursor amino acid sequence can confer additional pharmaceutical benefits. For example, the polypeptides of the invention can exhibit \n\n increased affinity for the IGF- 1 receptor or decreased binding ability to an inhibitory IGF-I or IGF-2 binding protein.\n\n\nFor the sake of clarity and consistency, the numbering of amino acid residues in IGF-I or IGF-2 precursor or mature proteins throughout this application and in the claims is based on the wild- type precursor protein sequence numbering without signal peptide.\n\n\nAccordingly, the invention includes a polypeptide containing a human IGF-I precursor protein, where the cleavage of the E-peptide from IGF-I by a protease is reduced by modification of the precursor protein. The E-peptide can be the Ea, Eb, or Ec peptide. At the N-terminus of the precursor, amino acids Gl, P2, or E3 of the precursor protein can be deleted or mutated, as can R36 (e.g., R36A) and R37 (e.g., R37A).\n\n\nThe precursor protein can further include the N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence NXS/T, for example by insertion of amino acids 93-102 of Ea between amino acids N95 and T96 of the Eb. In general, the precursor protein can include an oligosaccharide covalently linked to an amino acid side chain of the precursor protein, such as an arginine side chain of the precursor protein.\n\n\nIn addition, a residue of the precursor protein can be replaced by a non-natural amino acid (e.g., one that includes an acetylene or azido group). Such non-natural amino acids can facilitate linkage of a poly(ethylene glycol) moiety to a side-chain of the precursor protein, though typical protein pegylation strategies are well known in the art.\n\n\nThe precursor protein can further include one or more additional E-peptides linked to the C- terminus of the precursor protein. For example, a polypeptide can include, from N-terminus to C-terminus, (1) an IGF-I precursor protein having a first Eb peptide, where Gl, Pl, and El are deleted, either R36 or R37 or both are mutated, R71 and S72 are deleted, and the last seven C- terminal amino acids of the first Eb peptide are deleted; (2) a second Eb peptide, where R71, S72, and the last seven C-terminal amino acids of the second Eb peptide are deleted; (3) a third \n\n Eb peptide, where R71, S72, and the last seven C-terminal amino acids of the third Eb peptide are deleted; and (4) a fourth Eb peptide, where R71 and S72 are deleted.\n\n\nAn effective means of preventing cleavage of the E-peptide from the IGF- 1 is the deletion or mutation of R71 or S72.\n\n\nSimilarly, the invention includes a human IGF-2 precursor protein where the cleavage of the E- peptide from IGF-2 by a protease is reduced by modification of the precursor protein. In particular, deletion or mutation of R68 or D69 can be an effective means of avoiding protease digestion of the IGF-2 precursor protein.\n\n\nIn addition, any E-peptide of IGF-I can be combined with an IGF-2 and any E-peptide of IGF-2 can be combined with IGF-I to provide the benefits described herein.\n\n\nThe invention further includes a method of treating a musculoskeletal disease, diabetes, neuronal cell death by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a polypeptide of the invention. Likewise, the invention includes the use of a polypeptide of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a musculoskeletal disease, diabetes, neuronal cell death, or anemia.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention includes a pegylated IGF-I without an E-peptide but having introduced therein a non-natural amino acid as the site of pegylation. Any of the modified, pegylated IGF-I containing a non-natural amino acid as disclosed herein, without an E-peptide, is also included in the invention.\n\n\nThe invention also includes veterinary methods and uses of administering an effective amount of the polypeptide of the invention to obtain a desired effect.\n\n\nThe veterinary uses include (i) enhancing the rate and/or extent of growth in an animal, -(H) enhancing the efficiency of their conversion of feed into body tissue, (iii) enhancing milk production in lactating animals, (iv) treating animal wasting symptoms associated with cachexia, \n\n trauma, or other consumption diseases, and (v) treating lactating animals for improvement in neonatal health.\n\n\nAll cited references or documents are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n\nFigs. 1A-1C are Western blots of polypeptides of the invention and wild-type IGF-I precursor after zero or 16-hour incubation in the presence or absence of 10 % human serum at 37\n0\nC. Expression vectors encoding various IGF-I constructs were transfected into Cos7 cells, and the conditioned culture medium obtained. The \"3mut\" refers to a hIGF-1 -E-peptide precursor having the following three sets of modifications: deletion of Gl, P2, and E3; mutation of Arg 37 to Ala (R37A); and deletion of R71 and S72.

In addition, the polypeptide is lengthened by the addition of two more Eb peptides (but without R71 and S72 and without the last seven C-terminal amino acids) and the addition of a final Eb peptide (buth without R71 and S72) at the C-terminus of the polypeptide.\n\n\nThis construct is often referred to as the IGF-I-Eb multimer.

The utility of the polypeptides of the invention is based on the surprising discovery that such precursor polypeptides are biologically active, stable and beneficial as pharmaceuticals.\n\n\nScreening for Active IGF Precursor Polypeptides The usefulness of any polypeptide of the invention can be assessed using the following assays.\n\n\nStability A polypeptide of the invention should have sufficient stability in the presence of endogenous proteases, such as in human serum, to be an effective drug. To assess stability, an expression vector encoding the polypeptide can be transfected into Cos7 cells (ATCC) in a DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The culture medium containing secreted polypeptides can be applied to further analysis, or in the alternative, the expression vector can encode readily available tags, such as a hexa-histidine tag, in the polypeptide to facilitate efficient purification of the expressed polypeptides in the Cos7 cultures. However prepared, the polypeptide sample is incubated in normal human serum (Sigma) or in PBS for various times (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 10, and 16 hours), subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and the relevant \n\n proteins visualized using a primary antibody against human IGF-I or IGF-2 and a secondary antibody, e.g., conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Any number of similar blotting and detection techniques, some using fluorescent dyes or even radionuclides, can be used. The intensity of the precursor band versus the intensity of the IGF-I or IGF-2 band should indicate the degree to which the precursor polypeptide is cleaved under various conditions. A polypeptide of the invention that is exposed to human serum for 16 hours at 37°C can exhibit a ratio of uncleaved precursor to cleaved mature IGF of about 1:2 to 1:0.1, e.g., about 1:1 to 1:0.5, particularly a ratio of about 1 :1 or a ratio of about 1 :0.5. Typically, the precursor should exhibit a ratio of at least 1 :1.\n\n\nAKT Phosphorylation A polypeptide of the invention should maintain the ability to signal through the IGF-I receptor. (Both IGF-I and IGF-2 signal through the IGF-I receptor.) To determine this signaling ability, one can assess whether a downstream intracellular target, AKT, is phosphorylated in response to ligand binding at the cell surface. For analysis of AKT phosphorylation, C2C12 myoblasts are starved in serum-free medium and then stimulated with different ligands. Cells are lysed and cleared by centrifugation. AKT phosphorylation and total AKT levels are analyzed by ELISA using PathScan phospho AKT (Ser473) sandwich ELISA kit and PathScan AKT sandwich ELISA kit (Cell Signaling), respectively.\n\n\nIGF-I Receptor Specificity A polypeptide of the invention preferably maintains the specificity for the IGF-I receptor and should bind to the related insulin receptor with low affinity. To assess receptor specificity, polypeptide samples are added to serum-starved NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the IGF-I receptor or the insulin receptor, and the level of IGF-I receptor phosphorylation or insulin receptor phosphorylation is determined by lysing the cells and subjecting the lysates to ELISA using the DuoSet IC human phosphor-IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor ELISA kit (R&D Systems).\n\n\nIn Vivo Testing in Mouse Models of Hypertrophy To determine whether a polypeptide of the invention can act to increase skeletal muscle mass under a context that already leads to muscle hypertrophy, one can subject treated and untreated animals to exercise and determine whether animals receiving the polypeptide have developed larger muscles than untreated animals. \n\n Exercise Models\n\n\nOne model known in the art is based on the use of a voluntary running wheel with user-variable loads (see, e.g., Konhilas et al., Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 289:H455-H465, 2005). The voluntary cage wheel eliminates physical and psychological insults that are common in forced exercised models, and are therefore more appropriate for evaluating candidate drugs that are used in relatively healthy individuals for whom increases in muscle mass is desirable.\n\n\nAny suitable mouse strain can be used. For example, male C57B1/6J mice can be randomly assigned to experimental (e.g., receiving IGF precursor polypeptide) and control groups. Animals are individually housed in a cage containing an exercise wheel; sedentary control animals are housed in identical cages without a wheel. The exercise wheels are described in Allen et al., J Appl Physiol 90:1900-1908, 2001. Briefly, the system consists of an 11.5 cm- diameter wheel with a 5.0 cm-wide running surface (model 6208, Petsmart, Phoenix, AZ) equipped with a digital magnetic counter (model BC 600, Sigma Sport, Olney, IL) that is activated by wheel rotation. In addition, each wheel is engineered with a resistance mechanism allowing adjustment of the load. This is accomplished by attaching stainless steel fishing line to the cage top and wrapping the wire around an immovable pulley that is secured to the cage wheel at the axis of rotation so as to not contribute to the wheel load. The wire is again secured to the cage top with a spring and screw. This design permits fine adjustments of the wheel load, which is evenly distributed throughout the rotation of the wheel. Daily exercise values for time and distance run are recorded for each exercised animal throughout the duration of the exercise period. All animals are given water and standard hard rodent chow ad libitum. Voluntary running (cage wheel exposure) can begin at an average age of about 12 weeks for all groups. Each group continues running under varying resistance, depending on experimental group, for 50 days until the animals are about 19 weeks of age. The load on the wheel is determined by hanging known weights on the wheel until the wheel was slightly displaced. All exercise groups begin with no load on the cage wheel for the first week. However, the \"no-load\" condition is actually 2 g, which is determined as the load necessary to maintain wheel inertia and frictional load. Considering a wheel acclimatization period of 1 week, wheel loads can be changed at one- week intervals, except for higher loads, which can be changed after 2 weeks. The range of loads \n\n can be anywhere from 2 g to up to 12 g. Exercised and sedentary control animals are euthanized by cervical dislocation under inhaled anesthesia immediately after the end of the specific exercise period. Body mass is measured, and specific muscles are rapidly excised, washed, and frozen for histological or biochemical assays at a future date.\n\n\nAlternative exercise hypertrophy models are also available to the skilled artisan. See, e.g., the treadmill exercise model described in Lerman et al., J Appl Physiol 92:2245-2255, 2002.\n\n\nClenbuterol Injection Model Clenbuterol is a β\n2\n-adrenergic agonist with growth-promoting properties that cause a documented increase in muscle mass. The precise mechanism of clenbuterol action remains unclear, although a reduction in muscle protein degradation has been proposed. In the clinic, clenbuterol is used as an anti-asthma drug, but it appears to be mostly misused as a bodybuilding agent to increase muscle mass in both humans and show animals.\n\n\nFive mice are given a daily injection of clenbuterol (3 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.)) for 3, 7, or 14 days to induce muscle hypertrophy. Mice injected with PBS serves as negative control. The animals are monitored daily (visual inspection) for any adverse reactions (i.e. unkempt coat, lethargic) to the treatment. Clenbuterol treatment has the potential to make mice more fearful or aggressive, so mice should be especially monitored for fighting if housed in groups. Mice are mobile, and can eat and drink normally. Mice are monitored daily until they are euthanized on day 3, 7, or 14, and tissue collected for further analysis.\n\n\nIn Vivo Testing in Muscle Atrophy Models In various skeletal muscle atrophy models, an IGF precursor polypeptide of the invention can be tested for the ability to maintain muscle mass under conditions that generally reduce muscle mass. With the example models described below, the skilled artisan can readily design and implement controlled experiments involving the administration and use of IGF precursor polypeptides to determine whether such polypeptides can increase muscle mass. \n\n For example, C57B16/2 male mice are purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Mice are purchased so that they are about 9 weeks at the start of each experiment. Generally mice are housed in microisolator cages with normal rodent chow. At the start of each experiment mice are weighed. At the end of each experiment, generally mice are euthanized by CO\n2\n inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, and muscle tissues harvested for further processing. Mice are weighed to provide \"end body weight.\" Skeletal muscles that can be harvested are tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles. Other tissues harvested occasionally are: heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, testes, and brain. All muscles and tissues are completely dissected and weighed on a balance capable of measuring to 0.0001 g. Tissues are then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later RNA and protein extraction, or snap-frozen embedded in OCT on a cork disc. Muscles frozen on a cork disc for later cryosectioning are immersed in isopentane cooled to a thick slush by liquid nitrogen. All samples are stored at -80°C.\n\n\nDexamethasone Treatment\n\n\nA pharmacological method of inducing muscle wasting in mice is daily intraperitoneal injection with dexamethasone at 20mg/kg. Dexamethasone is a synthetic member of the glucocorticoid class of hormones. It acts as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant, with a potency of about 40 times that of hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. It is also given to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, to counteract certain side-effects of their antitumor treatment. Dexamethasone causes muscle atrophy both in mice and in human patients.\n\n\nMice are injected intraperitoneally (ip) with dexamethasone for 3, 7, or 14 days. On the terminal day subjects are euthanized using CO\n2\n, and the leg muscles harvested. The animals are monitored daily (visual inspection) for any adverse reactions (i.e. unkempt coat, lethargic) to the treatment. Mice are usually mobile, and can eat and drink normally. Mice injected with PBS are the negative control.\n\n\nCast Immobilization \n\n Physical disuse of various muscle groups results in atrophy of those muscles. Ankle joint fixation (\"pinned heel\" or casting) has proven to be a highly useful and reproducible way to induce physical immobilization of rat and mouse hindlimb musculature.\n\n\nMice are anesthetized with isofluorane for immobilization. The ankle and knee joints are fixed at 90 degrees with a light-weight casting material (VET-LITE) around the joints. The material is soaked in warm water and then wrapped around the limb, leaving the toes and hip joint free. The joints are maintained in at 90° positions until the casting material has dried. The contralateral leg serves as control. The mice are then allowed to recover from anesthesia and housed in normal micro isolator cages. Casting has not been observed to cause excessive stress, and animals freely move about the cage to feed and drink. The mice are however monitored daily for any adverse events affecting body weight, activity, and irritations.\n\n\nOnce a cast is applied to a mouse, the animal is monitored daily to make sure that the cast remains in place, as chewing can occur. The animals can move, drink, and feed after recovery of anesthesia, and they do not require special bedding, caging or other assistance.\n\n\nDenervation\n\n\nGenerally, mice are anesthetized with isofluorane gas for denervation. Using aseptic surgical procedures (three washes of betadine with a final ethanol wash), the right sciatic nerve is isolated in the mid-thigh and a 2 to 5 mm piece cut out. The contralateral leg serves as control.\n\n\nMore specifically, the skin incision is closed with a suture clip, and the animals injected with a single dose of buprenorphine before being allowed to recover from the anesthesia. Three, seven, or 14 days after surgery animals are euthanized by CO\n2\n inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, and muscles (gastrocnemius complex, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus) are removed for histological and biochemical analyses.\n\n\nGiven that the sciatic nerve is transected, the effected limb is rendered immobile to induce skeletal muscle atrophy of the muscles involved. The animal can otherwise move, drink, and feed after recovery of anesthesia and they do not require special bedding, caging or other \n\n assistance. Nonetheless, animals are monitored immediately post-surgery and through recovery (1-2 hrs). In addition, the incision sites and general animal health are monitored for 3 days post- surgery. The suture clip is removed 7 to 10 days after surgery.\n\n\nGenetic Models\n\n\nGenetically manipulated transgenic mice can also be used as models of muscle atrophy. For example, the so-called Mini Mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No. 003258) contains a knock out mutation in the IGF-I gene that results in abnormally decreased postnatal growth, as well as low body weight and size. For additional information, see Powell-Braxton et al., Genes Dev 7:2609-2617, 1993. In addition, the so-called Midi Mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No. 003259) contains a different mutation in the IGF-I gene that results in a hypomorph exhibiting low adult body weight and other cardiovascular phenotypes. For additional information, see Lembo et al., J Clin Invest 98:2648-2655, 1996.\n\n\nCritical and Optional Mutations or Modificatons in the IGF Precursors\n\n\nCritical Mutations The invention is based in part on the observation that an IGF precursor polypeptide that contains substantially its E-peptide remains bioactive and stable in the presence of serum. To ensure that the E-peptide is not cleaved by endogenous proteases targeting the dibasic protease site, in general either of the two N-terminal dibasic amino acids of the E-peptide in the precursor is deleted, mutated, or otherwise masked. In the case of hIGF-1, these two amino acids are R71 and S72, while in the case of hIGF-2, these first two amino acids are R68 and D69.\n\n\nA variety of modifications enables this prevention of cleavage: (1) Deletion of one or both dibasic residues\n\n\n(2) Mutate one or both dibasic residues to a non-basic amino acid, such as alanine\n\n\n(3) Insert one or more non-basic amino acids between the dibasic residues\n\n\n(4) Place a glycosylation site near the dibasic residues sufficient to mask the protease site\n\n\n(5) Site-directed pegylation using replacement of either dibasic residue, or insertion near or between the dibasic residues, with a non-natural amino acid, as described below. \n\n In addition, residues K68 and K65 appear to play a role in IGF-1/E-peptide cleavage; accordingly, mutations or deletions of these residues can be incorporated into any tactic directed to the dibasic amino acids as described above.\n\n\nMutations at the N -terminus of Mature IGF In certain embodiments of the invention, the IGF precursor polypeptides have deletions or mutations of the first few N-terminal amino acids. In the case of IGF-I, any of the first three N-terminal amino acids can be deleted or mutated, whereas in the case of IGF-2, any of the first six N-terminal amino acids can be deleted or mutated. It has been observed that certain N-terminal amino acids are naturally cleaved in vivo, and the introduction of these mutations or deletions minimizes the in vivo associations of the polypeptides of the invention with IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). The interaction of IGF-I and IGF-2 with the IGF-I receptor is regulated by IGFBPs. All six IGFBPs have been shown to inhibit IGF action (particularly IGFBP5), but in some instances a stimulatory effect has been observed. At least 99% of the IGF in the circulation is normally bound to IGFBPs. The most abundant IGFBP in the circulation after the neonatal period is IGFBP3 which can bind both IGF- 1 and IGF-2 with similar affinities. The naturally occurring truncated IGF-I (bearing deletion of Gl, P2, and E3) binds to IGFBP3 with several times lower affinity than natural IGF-I. In addition, G3 is important for IGFBP binding, and G6 plays a similar role in the IGF-2 peptide.\n\n\nAccordingly, in the case of the hIGF-1 precursor, any of Gl, P2, or E3 can be deleted or mutated either alone or in combination. When a mutation is desired, a mutation to alanine can be introduced. In another example, in the case of hIGF-2 precursor, any of P4, S5, and E6 can be deleted or mutated either alone or in combination. When a mutation is desired, a mutation to alanine can be introduced.\n\n\nMutations at Residues 36 and 37 IGF-I can e cleaved by serine proteases present in human serum. Mutation of either R36 or R37 to A can prevent cleavage of IGF-I at this predicted cleavage site between R36 and R37. In the case of hIGF-2, R38 can be mutated or deleted to prevent this deleterious cleavage. \n\n Use ofGlycosylation The in vivo half-life of the polypeptides of the invention can be improved by the addition of N-linked glycosylation sites into either the IGF or the E-peptide portions of the precursor when expressed in mammalian or other eukaryotic cells capable of N-linked glycosylation. It has been shown in vitro that human IGF-I Ea is glycosylated at N92 and NlOO, as these portions of Ea fits the consensus N-linked glycosylation sequence of N-X-S/T, where X can be any amino acid and the third amino acid of the triplet is either S or T. It is also know that the adjacent amino acid context of the consensus will affect how strongly the asparagine is glycosylated. Therefore, one strategy to introduce a glycosylation site into Eb or Ec is to insert Ea amino acids around the consensus sequence into roughly the same part of Eb or Ec. A particular implementation of this strategy is illustrated in the Examples below. In any event, any other consensus N-linked glycosylation site, including surrounding context amino acids, known to the skilled artisan can be inserted into a precursor polypeptide of the invention. In addition, O-linked glycosylation of a polypeptide of the invention can be accomplished by choosing the particular host used for production of the polypeptide. For example, use of certain yeast strains for IGF-I expression results in the addition of oligosaccharides on a serines or threonines. See, e.g., US Patent No. 5,273,966.\n\n\nAddition of Poly (ethylene glycol) Conjugation to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG; pegylation) have proven to be beneficial in prolonging the half-life of therapeutic proteins drugs. It is expected that pegylation of the IGF precursor polypeptides of the invention may result in similar pharmaceutical advantages. Methods of pegylation of IGF-I are well known in the art. See, for example, US Patent Application Publication 2006/0154865, which describes the beneficial properties of lysine-monopegylated IGF-I. Such lysine-monopegylation can be adapted for the precursor IGF polypeptides of the invention. In addition, pegylation can be achieved in any part of a polypeptide of the invention by the introduction of a nonnatural amino acid. Certain nonnatural amino acids can be introduced by the technology described in Deiters et al., J Am Chem Soc 125:11782-11783, 2003; Wang and Schultz, Science 301 :964-967, 2003; Wang et al., Science 292:498-500, 2001; Zhang et al., Science 303:371-373, 2004 or in US Patent No. 7,083,970. Briefly, some of these expression systems involve site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a nonsense codon, such as an amber TAG, into the open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of the invention. Such expression vectors are then introduced into a host that can \n\n utilize a tRNA specific for the introduced nonsense codon and charged with the nonnatural amino acid of choice. Particular nonnatural amino acids that are beneficial for purpose of conjugating moieties to the polypeptides of the invention include those with acetylene and azido side chains. The IGF precursor polypeptides containing these novel amino acids can then be pegylated at these chosen sites in the protein. In addition, such pegylated IGF molecules without the E-peptide are also useful as therapeutics.\n\n\nMultimers ofE-Peptides In certain pharmacological contexts, it is beneficial to increase the size of a peptide or protein drug to ensure that the drug remains on one side of the blood- brain barrier or the other. Since mature IGF molecules are relatively short peptides, even if the E- peptide remains attached, it can be beneficial to increase the size of the polypeptides of the invention. One means of doing so is to provide multimers of E-peptides at the C-terminus of the IGF precursor polypeptide, as illustrated in certain Examples described below.\n\n\nC-Terminal Deletion of E-Peptides It is suspected that the free cysteine at position 81 of Eb may result in homodimerization or other effects that, when present in the polypeptides of the invention, might lead to lower activity drugs. Thus, deletion or mutation of C81 in Eb can optimize drug activity. In a particular example, deletion of the last seven amino acids of Eb (i.e., amino acids 81-87) is beneficial.\n\n\nOther Mutations or Modifications Additional mutations or modifications of IGF that can be incorporated into the IGF precursor polypeptides of the invention are described in US Patent No. 5 ,077, ,276; and US Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0287151, 2006/0211606, and 2006/0166328.\n\n\nThe invention should be construed, in addition to human IGF-I and IGF -2, to include all known and unknown non-human animal precursor IGF-I or IGF-2 sequences containing substantially its E-peptide wherein the normal cleavage of the E-peptide is avoided or reduced according to modifications of the present invention.\n\n\nThe preferred type of IGF to be used depends upon the species of the subject being treated. \n\n It is preferred that the IGF is species-matched, for example, when a cow is being treated, the preferred type of IGF is bovine IGF.\n\n\nAlthough all forms of IGF are likely to have an effect in different subjects due to the high sequence homologies, species matching will avoid potential adverse immunological complications stemming from the induction of an immune response to an IGF from a different species.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, modified non-human animal precursor IGF-I sequences are provided.\n\n\nPreferred are precursor IGF-I sequences containing substantially its E-peptide wherein the normal cleavage of the E-peptide is avoided or reduced according to modifications of the present invention from a vertebrate animal.\n\n\nFor example, such sequences include but are not limited to sequences from a mouse, rat, cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat, bird, dog, cat, fish and the like, from any source whether natural, synthetic, or recombinant.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, modified non-human animal precursor IGF-2 sequences are provided.\n\n\nPreferred are precursor IGF-2 sequences containing substantially its E-peptide wherein the normal cleavage of the E-peptide is avoided or reduced according to modifications of the present invention from a vertebrate animal.\n\n\nFor example, such sequences include but are not limited to sequences from a mouse, rat, cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat, bird, dog, cat, fish and the like from any source, whether natural, synthetic, or recombinant.\n\n\nTherapeutic Use of IGF Precursor Polypeptides \n\n Indications The invention also includes the use of an IGF precursor polypeptide of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a musculoskeletal disease. In addition, the invention includes use of IGF precursor polypepides to increase muscle or bone mass in an individual, whether or not such an individual is at risk for or has a musculoskeletal disease.\n\n\nIn particular, the musculoskeletal disease can be muscle atrophy. There are many causes of muscle atrophy, including as a result of treatment with a glucocorticoid such as Cortisol, dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, or prednisolone. The muscle atrophy can also be a result of denervation due to nerve trauma or a result of degenerative, metabolic, or inflammatory neuropathy (e.g., Guillian-Barre syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, or exposure to environmental toxins or drugs). In addition, the muscle atrophy can be a result of an adult motor neuron disease, infantile spinal muscular atrophy, juvenile spinal muscular atrophy, autoimmune motor neuropathy with multifocal conductor block, paralysis due to stroke or spinal cord injury, skeletal immobilization due to trauma, prolonged bed rest, voluntary inactivity, involuntary inactivity, metabolic stress or nutritional insufficiency, cancer, AIDS, fasting, rhabdomyolysis, a thyroid gland disorder, diabetes, benign congenital hypotonia, central core disease, nemalene myopathy, myotubular (centronuclear) myopathy, burn injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, sepsis, renal failure, congestive heart failure, or ageing.\n\n\nThe musculoskeletal disease can also be a muscular dystrophy syndrome, such as Duchenne, Becker, myotonic, fascioscapulohumeral, Emery-Deifuss, oculopharyngeal, scapulohumeral, limb girdle, a congenital muscular dystrophy, or hereditary distal myopathy. The musculoskeletal disease can also be osteoporosis, a bone fracture, short stature, or dwarfism.\n\n\nIGF-I is suggested as a treatment for insulin-insensitive diabetes, since IGF-I can also bind heterodimers of IGF-I receptor and insulin receptor. Accordingly, the polypeptides of the invention can be used to treat diabetes. \n\n IGF-I is neurotrophic and increases survival of neurons. It has been suggested that IGF-I can be used to treat instances of motor-neuron death such as seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain atrophy, ageing, and dementia. Accordingly, the polypeptides of the invention can be used to treat conditions associated with neuronal death, such as ALS, brain atrophy, or dementia.\n\n\nIGF-I increases both white and red blood cell populations and has an additive effect to administration of erythropoietin. Accordingly, the polypeptides of the invention can be used to treat anemia.\n\n\nSince IGF-I and IGF -2 are ubiquitous and essential regulators of cell division and vertebrate growth, they may be advantageously used in a variety of veterinary methods to exogenously enhance or maintain growth in an animal. Some examples include, but are not limited to: (i) enhancing rate and/or extent of growth in an animal, for example, enhancing muscle growth in swine, cattle, poultry and fish;\n\n\n(ii) enhancing the efficiency of their conversion of feed into body tissue (lean to fat ratio), for example, in swine, cattle, sheep, poultry and fish; and\n\n\n(iii) enhancing milk production in lactating animals, for example, dairy cattle, sheep, goats. Other veterinary therapeutic applications include, but are not limited to: (iv) treating animal wasting symptoms associated with cachexia, trauma or other consumption diseases, for example, in companion animals such as dogs, cats, and horses; and (v) treating lactating animals for improvement in neonatal health, for example, lactating sows for improvement in neonatal performance.\n\n\nMethods of Administration The polypeptides of the invention can be delivered in a variety of ways, including the use of gene delivery vehicles. Methods known in the art for the therapeutic delivery of agents such as proteins or nucleic acids can be used for the therapeutic delivery of a polypeptide of the invention, e.g., cellular transfection, gene therapy, direct administration with a delivery vehicle, or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, indirect delivery by providing recombinant cells containing a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. \n\n Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the polypeptide of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J Biol Chem 262:4429-4432, 1987), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral, adeno- associated viral, adenoviral, poxviral (e.g., avipoxviral, particularly fowlpoxviral) or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction can be enteral or parenteral and include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, pulmonary, intranasal, intraocular, epidural, and oral routes. The polypeptides can be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., by injection, by means of a catheter, or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, fibers, or commercial skin substitutes.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the active agent can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533, 1990). In yet another embodiment, the active agent can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used. In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Howard et al., J Neurosurg 71 : 105, 1989). In another embodiment where the active agent of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression \n\n of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see, for example, US Patent No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see, e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864- 1868, 1991), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellular^ and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.\n\n\nCellular Transfection and Gene Therapy The present invention encompasses the use of nucleic acids encoding polypeptides of the invention for transfection of cells in vitro and in vivo. These nucleic acids can be inserted into any of a number of well-known vectors for transfection of target cells and organisms. The nucleic acids are transfected into cells ex vivo and in vivo, through the interaction of the vector and the target cell. The compositions are administered (e.g., by injection into a muscle) to a subject in an amount sufficient to elicit a therapeutic response.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a target site, i.e., a target cell or tissue, in a human or other animal including transfecting a cell with a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention, wherein the nucleic acid includes an inducible promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the targeting fusion polypeptide. For gene therapy procedures in the treatment or prevention of human disease, see for example, Van Brunt Biotechnology 6:1149-1 154, 1998.\n\n\nCombination Therapies In numerous embodiments, the polypeptides of the present invention can be administered in combination with one or more additional compounds or therapies. For example, multiple polypeptides can be co-administered in conjunction with one or more therapeutic compounds. The combination therapy may encompass simultaneous or alternating administration. In addition, the combination may encompass acute or chronic administration. The polypeptides of the invention can be administered in combination with anabolic agents such as testosterone or specific androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Additional anabolic agents include growth hormone (GH) or molecules that induce GH release. Ghrelin is particularly \n\n useful in a combination therapy for cachexia, since Ghrelin can cause an increase in appetite. In a similar vein, the polypeptides of the invention can be combined with protein supplements to increase anabolism, or combined with physical therapy or exercise to increase body weight. Any molecule that inhibits myostatin is also a candidate for combination therapy.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a IGF precursor protein of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals or humans. The term \"carrier\" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\" by E. W. Martin.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water \n\n for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with free amino groups such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with free carboxyl groups such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.\n\n\nThe amount of a polypeptide of the invention which will be effective in the treatment of a condition or disease can be determined by standard clinical techniques based on the present description. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each subject's circumstances. However, suitable dosage ranges for intravenous administration are generally about 20-5000 micrograms of active compound per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.01 pg/kg body weight to 1 mg/kg body weight. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. In particular, a possible dosage regimen can be about 60 to 120 μg/kg body weight, subcutaneous injection, twice daily.\n\n\nVeterinary Uses\n\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned methods of administration in humans, there may be additional considerations for veterinary administration.\n\n\nThe dosage may differ when administered to a healthy animal versus those animals suffering from a disease. An assessment of the appropriate dosage can easily be made by those skilled in the art using assays known in the art, for example, the myoblast proliferation assay (Example 79) or the mammary epithelial tissue assay (Example 80) as described below. General assays to measure IGF are also known in the art, such as those in Example 81. \n\n Those skilled in the art will recognize that some species of animal exhibit seasonal fertility influenced by the length of the photoperiod. Any embodiment of a veterinary method or use may optionally include starting the treatment method at a specific time within the animal's reproductive cycle in order to achieve the desired effect. Those skilled in the art will know that reproductive status and cycle can easily be determined, and, if desired, synchronized by the use of an appropriate regimen.\n\n\nWhen used for veterinary indications, in addition to methods previously mentioned for human use, the IGF-I or IGF-2 peptide of the present invention can also be used as an oral drench, or a supplement to oral or solid feeds for animals.\n\n\nThe invention is further described but not limited by the following Examples.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nA DNA expression vector encoding the hIGF-1-Ea precursor polypeptide containing the following modifications was constructed: deletion of Gl, deletion of P2, and deletion of E3; mutation of R37 to A; and deletion of R71 and deletion of S72. These mutations are sometimes referred to as \"3mut\" throughout the present disclosure. This results in the following secreted protein sequence:\n\n\ntlcgaelvdalqfvcgdrgfyfnkptgygsssraapqtgivdeccfrscdlrrlemycaplkpaksavraqrhtdmpktqkevhlknasr gsagnknyrm (SEQ ID NO: 8)\n\n\nCos7 cells (available from ATCC) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and plated at a density of 1 x 10\n6\n cells per 10-cm plate. These cell cultures were transfected with 8 μg of expression plasmid using Fugene (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed once and cultured in serum-free medium for 48 hours. Supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C. \n\n In order to assess polypeptide stability in human serum, supernatants collected from the Cos7 cells transfected with wild-type (wt) hlGF-lEa, and hIGF-lEa3mut were incubated for 16 hours at 37°C either in the absence or presence of 10% human serum (Sigma). Samples were separated by 18% SDS-PAGE, and imunoblotting was performed using goat polyclonal antibody to human IGF-I. The results in Fig. IA indicate that, while the wt hlGF-lEa was substantially degraded after incubation with serum for 16 hours, the hIGF-lEa3mut was stabilized. Densitometry indicated that the ratio of uncleaved to cleaved IGF-I was about 1:6.2, while the ratio for hlGF- lEa3mut was about 1 :0.68, showing that these mutations result in a stabilized polypeptide.\n\n\nTo confirm that the hIGF-lEa3mut was able to signal through the IGF-IR, AKT phosphorylation of cells in contact with the polypeptide was measured. C2C12 were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (AMIMED), 100U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen). For analysis of AKT phosphorylation, the C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 0.15 x 10\n6\n cells per well of a 6-well plate and were cultured in growth medium for 72 hours. Cells were starved for four hours in serum-free medium and then stimulated with different ligands at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cells were lysed with PhosphoSafe buffer (Cell Signaling) containing various protease inhibitors and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. AKT phosphorylation and total AKT levels were analyzed by ELISA using PathScan phospho AKT (Ser473) sandwich ELISA kit and PathScan AKT sandwich ELISA kit (Cell Signaling), respectively. The AKT phosphorylation results are summarized in Fig. 2 A, which indicate that the hIGF-lEa3mut was able to activate the IGF-IR cellular pathway to a similar extent as the long-R3-IGF-l positive control reagent and the recombinant IGF-I . In addition, the data in Fig. 5 directly shows that hIGF-lEa3mut led to AKT phosphorylation.\n\n\nNext, to ensure that the receptor specificity of the hIGF-lEa3mut remained with the IGF-IR, various ligands were added to cultures of NIH3T3 overexpressing either IGF-IR or insulin receptor (InsR). These cells were cultured under the same conditions as described above for Cos7 cells. For analysis of IGF-IR and InsR phosphorylation, NIH3T3-IGF1R and N1H3T3- \n\n lnsR cells were plated at a density of 0.2 x 10\n6\n cells per well of a 6-well plate and were cultured in growth medium for 24 hours. Cells were starved for 18 hours in serum-free medium and then stimulated with different ligands at 37°C for 10 minutes. Cells were lysed as described above for the AKT experiment, and 1GF-1R and InsR phosphorylation levels were analyzed by ELISA using DuoSet IC human phosphor-IGFIR and -InsR ELISA kit (R&D Systems). The results summarized in Figs. 3 A and 3B indicate that this IGF-I precursor polypeptide retains specificity for the IGF-I receptor and should bind to the related insulin receptor with low affinity.\n\n\nExample 2 A DNA expression vector encoding the hIGF- 1 -Eb precursor polypeptide containing the following mutations was constructed: deletion of Gl, deletion of P2, and deletion of E3; mutation of R37 to A; and deletion of R71 and deletion of S72 (i.e., the \"3mut\"). This results in the following secreted protein sequence:\n\n\ntlcgaelvdalqfvcgdrgfyfnkptgygsssarapqtgivdeccfrscdlrrlemycaplkpaksavraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnk ntksqrrkgwpkthpggeqkegteaslqirgkkkeqrreigsrnaecrgkkgk (SEQ ID NO:9)\n\n\nThe polypeptide was assayed in accordance with the procedures described in Example 1 above. Fig. IB and use of densitometry indicated that the ratio of uncleaved to cleaved IGF-I was about 1:9, while the ratio for hIGF-lEb3mut was about 1 :1, showing that these modifications result in a stabilized polypeptide. Fig. 2B indicates that the hIGF-lEb3mut was able to activate the IGF- IR cellular pathway to a similar extent as the Iong-R3-1GF-1 positive control reagent and the recombinant IGF-I. In addition, the data in Fig. 5 directly shows that hIGF-lEb3mut led to AKT phosphorylation. The results summarized in Figs. 3C and 3D indicate that this IGF-I precursor polypeptide retains specificity for the IGF-I receptor and should bind to the related insulin receptor with low affinity.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nA DNA expression vector encoding the hIGF-1-Ec precursor polypeptide containing the following mutations was constructed: deletion of Gl , deletion of P2, and deletion of E3; \n\n mutation of R37 to A; and deletion of R71 and deletion of S72 (i.e., the \"3mut\").

Fig. 1C and use of densitometry indicated that the ratio of uncleaved to cleaved IGF-I was about 1 :5, while the ratio for hIGF-lEc3mut was about 1 :0.96, showing that these modifications result in a stabilized polypeptide. Fig. 2D indicates that the hIGF-lEc3mut was able to activate the IGF-IR cellular pathway to a similar extent as the long-R3-IGF-l positive control reagent and the recombinant IGF-I. In addition, the data in Fig. 5 directly shows that hIGF-lEc3mut led to AKT phosphorylation. The results summarized in Figs. 4A and 4B indicate that this IGF-I precursor polypeptide retains specificity for the IGF-I receptor and should bind to the related insulin receptor with low affinity.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nA DNA expression vector encoding the hIGF-1-Eab chimeric precursor polypeptide containing the following modifications to the hIGF-1-Eb peptide was constructed: deletion of Gl, deletion of P2, and deletion of E3; mutation of R37 to A; deletion of R71 and deletion of S72 (i.e., the \"3mut\"); and insertion of Ea amino acids 93 to 102 between amino acids 95 and 96 of Eb. The insertion creates a putative N-linked glycosylation signal at N92. This results in the following secreted protein sequence:\n\n\ntlcgaelvdalqfvcgdrgfyfnkptgygsssraapqtgivdeccfrscdlrrlemycaplkpaksavraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnk nasrgsagnkntksqrrkgwpkthpggeqkegteaslqirgkkkeqrreigsrnaecrgkkgk (SEQ ID NO:1 1)\n\n\nThe polypeptide was assayed in accordance with some of the procedures described in Example 1 above. Fig. 2C indicates that the hIGF-lEab3mut was able to activate the IGF-IR cellular pathway to a similar extent as the long-R3-IGF-l positive control reagent and the recombinant \n\n IGF-I. The results summarized in Figs. 4C and 4D indicate that this IGF-I precursor polypeptide retains specificity for the IGF-I receptor and does not activate the insulin receptor.\n\n\nExample 5 A DNA expression vector encoding the hIGF-1-Eb multimer precursor polypeptide containing the following mutations was constructed: deletion of Gl, deletion of P2, deletion of E3, deletion of R36, deletion of R37, deletion of R71, deletion of S72, deletion of the last seven C- terminal amino acids of Eb; and insertion to the C-terminus of this precursor of two additional Eb peptides both without the R71 and S72 and last seven C-terminal amino acids and a fourth and final Eb peptide without the R71 and S72. Fig. 6A shows a schematic drawing of this construct. This results in the following secreted protein sequence:\n\n\ntlcgaelvdalqfvcgdrgfyfnkptgygsssapqtgivdeccfrscdlrrlemycaplkpaksavraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnknt ksqrrkgwpkthpggeqkegteaslqirgkkkeqrreigsrnaersvraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnkntksqrrkgwpkthpggeq kegteaslqirgkkkeqrreigsrnaersvraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnkntksqrrkgwpkthpggeqkegteaslqirgkkkeqrr eigsrnaersvraqrhtdmpktqkyqppstnkntksqrrkgwpkthpggeqkegteaslqirgkkkeqrreigsrnaecrgkkgk (SEQ ID NO: 12)\n\n\nThis polypeptide was subjected to an AKT phosphorylation assay as described in Example 1.

This construct contains the following modifications: deletion of Gl, deletion of P2, deletion of E3, deletion of R36, deletion of R37, deletion of R71, deletion of S72; and the insertion of Ea amino acids 93-102 between amino acids 95 and 96 of Eb, thereby creating an N- linked glycosylation site at position N92 and NlOO.

Factors active in this system behave similarly in primary cultures of myoblasts. The enhancement of myoblast proliferation in vitro by a peptide of this invention indicates its activity in causing increased myoblast proliferation and, therefore, an increase in ultimate myofiber number in utero. In addition, similar enhancement of myoblast proliferation indicates that peptides of this invention can be used to enhance adult muscle hypertrophy, e.g. via stimulation of satellite muscle cell proliferation.\n\n\nExample 80: Mammary Epithelial Tissue Assay\n\n\nIn lactating animals, the amount of mammary epithelial tissue is a limiting factor in milk production, as these are the cells which produce and secrete milk. Employing in vitro systems, epithelial cells obtained from mammary glands of animals can be stimulated by the modified IGF-I or IGF-2 of the present invention to proliferate and produce increased quantities of milk constituents. It can further be demonstrated that mammary epithelial cells stimulated to proliferate in one such in vitro cell system can be reimplanted in cleared mammary fat pads and be stimulated to proliferate and/or produce milk in lactating female animals.\n\n\nExample 81 : Measurement of IGF-I or IGF-2 in Blood or Other Body Fluids The effective amount of the peptide administered parenterally per dose can be measured by a dose-response curve. For example, modified IGF peptides of the invention can be measured in \n\n the blood or body fluids of the subject to be treated to determine the dosing. Alternatively, one can administer increasing amounts of the peptide to the subject and check the serum levels of the subject for modified IGF-I and IGF-2. The amount of peptide to be employed can be calculated on a molar basis based on these serum levels of modified IGF-I or IGF-2.\n\n\nOne method for determining appropriate dosing of the peptide entails measuring an IGF peptide of the invention in a biological fluid such as a body or blood fluid. Measuring such levels can be done by any means, including RIA and ELISA. After measuring IGF levels, the fluid is contacted with the peptide using single or multiple doses. After this contacting step, the IGF levels are re-measured in the fluid. If the fluid IGF levels have fallen by an amount sufficient to produce the desired efficacy for which the molecule is to be administered, then the dose of the molecule can be adjusted to produce maximal efficacy. This method may be carried out in vitro or in vivo. Preferably, this method is carried out in vivo, i.e., after the fluid is extracted from a subject and the IGF levels measured, the peptide herein is administered to the mammal using single or multiple doses (that is, the contacting step is achieved by administration to an animal), and then the IGF levels are re-measured from fluid extracted from the animal.\n\n\nAnother method for determining dosing is to use antibodies to the peptide or another detection method for the peptide in the LIFA format.\n\n\nExample 82: In Vivo Pharmacokinetics of hIGF-1-Ec 3mut\n\n\nAdult male mice (n = 3/group) received an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of rhIGF-1 at\n\n\n1 mg/kg, and hIGF-1-Ec 3mut (described in Example 3) at 1.55 mg/kg. Serial blood specimens were collected at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after administration of test material. Serum concentrations of rhIGF-1 and hIGF-1-Ec 3mut were determined by ELISA. This assay is specific for hIGF-1.\n\n\nEquimolar doses of rhIGF-1 and hIGF-1-Ec 3mut were administered i.v. in mice. The results show significantly higher levels of the hIGF-1-Ec 3mut protein as compared to rhIGF-1 at all examined time points, indicating that the hIGF-1-Ec 3mut is metabolically more stable than the 70 amino acid-long IGF-I. \n\n time (min) IGF-1-Ec 3mut (nM) IGF-1 (nM)\n\n\n5 201.4 54.7\n\n\n15 65.3 14.3\n\n\n30 12 2.4\n\n\n60 0.76 0.2\n\n\nWhat is claimed is"

Description\n\n\n\n\n AMIDO-ISOTHIAZOLE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application is related to United States provisional patent application number 61/186,963 filed 15 June 2009, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention pertains generally to the field of therapeutic compounds.\n\n\nMore specifically the present invention pertains to certain amido-isothiazole compounds that, inter alia, inhibit 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1).\n\n\nThe present invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and the use of such compounds and compositions, both in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ; to treat disorders that are ameliorated by the inhibition of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ; to treat the metabolic syndrome, which includes disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, and associated disorders including insulin resistance, hypertension, lipid disorders and cardiovascular disorders such as ischaemic (coronary) heart disease; to treat CNS disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and early dementia, including Alzheimer's disease; etc.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nA number of publications are cited herein in order to more fully describe and disclose the invention and the state of the art to which the invention pertains. Each of these references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure, to the same extent as if each individual reference was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThroughout this specification, including the claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \"comprise,\" and variations such as \"comprises\" and \"comprising,\" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.\n\n\nIt must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \"a pharmaceutical carrier\" includes mixtures of two or more such carriers, and the like. \n\n Ranges are often expressed herein as from \"about\" one particular value, and/or to \"about\" another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by the use of the antecedent \"about,\" it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment.\n\n\nThis disclosure includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids (Cortisol in man, corticosterone in rodents) are hormones that regulate a range of pathways involved in stress and metabolic signalling. They are antagonists of insulin action and impair insulin-dependent glucose uptake, increase lipolysis, and enhance hepatic gluconeogenesis. These effects are evident in Cushing's syndrome, which is caused by elevated circulating levels of glucocorticoids. The features of Cushing's syndrome are diverse and reflect the tissue distribution of glucocorticoid receptors in the body. They include a cluster of metabolic (central/visceral obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia) and cardiovascular (hypertension) abnormalities which, when observed in patients without Cushing's syndrome, constitute the metabolic syndrome. These abnormalities confer a substantial risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, Cushing's syndrome is associated with neuropsychiatry manifestations including depression and cognitive impairment. The features of Cushing's syndrome are reversible upon removal of the cause of glucocorticoid excess.\n\n\nIt is recognised that glucocorticoid activity is controlled at the tissue level by the intracellular conversion of active Cortisol and inactive cortisone by 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (see, e.g., Seckl et al., 2001). These enzymes exist in two distinct isoforms. 11 β-HSD1 , which catalyses the reaction that activates cortisone, is expressed in liver, adipose tissue, brain, skeletal muscle, vascular smooth muscle and other organs, while, 11β-HSD2, which inactivates Cortisol, is predominantly expressed in the kidney. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 in rat and man with carbenoxolone (see, e.g., Walker et al., 1995), and transgenic knockout in mice (see, e.g., Kotelevtsev et al., 1997), results in enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduced gluconeogenesis and glycogenosis, suggesting that 11β-HSD1 inhibition will be a useful treatment in type 2 diabetes and other insulin resistance syndromes. Furthermore, mice lacking 11β-HSD1 possess low triglycerides, increased HDL cholesterol, and increased apo-lipoprotein A-I levels (see, e.g., Morton et al., 2001), suggesting that inhibitors of 11β-HSD1 may be of utility in the treatment of atherosclerosis.\n\n\nThe link between 11β-HSD1 and the metabolic syndrome has been strengthened by studies in transgenic mice and man. 11β-HSD1 knockout mice on two different genetic backgrounds are protected from dietary obesity (see, e.g., Morton et al., 2004), while \n\n administration of carbenoxolone to patients with type 2 diabetes enhances insulin sensitivity (see, e.g., Andrews et al., 2003). However, it has become apparent that the key tissue in which 11β-HSD1 exerts the greatest influence upon metabolic disease is the adipose tissue rather than the liver. Mice with transgenic overexpression of 11 β-HSD1 in adipose tissue (see, e.g. Masuzaki et al., 2001) have a more profound metabolic syndrome and obesity than mice with overexpression in liver (see, e.g., Paterson et al., 2004). In obese humans, 11 β-HSD1 activity is increased in adipose tissue, but enzyme activity is decreased in the liver (see, e.g., Rask et al., 2001).\n\n\nIn the CNS, 11 β-HSD1 is highly expressed in regions important for cognition such as hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum (see, e.g., Moisan et al., 1990). Elevated Cortisol is associated with cognitive dysfunction, and glucocorticoids have a range of neurotoxic effects. 11β-HSD1 knockout mice are protected against age-related cognitive dysfunction (see, e.g., Yau et al., 2001), while administration of the 11β-HSD inhibitor carbenoxolone has been shown to enhance cognitive function in elderly men and type 2 diabetics who have a selective impairment in verbal memory (see, e.g., Sandeep et al., 2004). Thus, 11 β-HSD1 inhibitors are of potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, which are characterised by cognitive impairment.\n\n\nThe isozymes of 11β-HSD are also expressed in the blood vessel wall (see, e.g., Walker et al., 1991 ; Christy et al., 2003). 11β-HSD1 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle, while 11 β-HSD2 is expressed in endothelial cells where it modulates endothelial- dependent vasodilation (see, e.g., Hadoke et al., 2001). 11β-HSD1 knockout mice have normal vascular function, but they exhibit enhanced angiogenesis in response to inflammation or ischaemia (see, e.g., Small et al., 2005). This offers therapeutic potential in the treatment of myocardial infarction, since inhibition of 11β-HSD1 may enhance revascularisation of ischaemic tissues.\n\n\nStudies have shown that 11 β-HSD1 affects intraocular pressure in man (see, e.g., Rauz et al., 2001). Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 may be useful in reducing intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids are involved in the regulation of bone formation and skeletal development. Treatment of healthy volunteers with carbenoxolone led to a decrease in bone resorption markers suggesting that 11 β-HSD1 plays a role in bone resorption (see, e.g., Cooper et al., 2000). 11 β-HSD1 inhibitors could be used as protective agents in the treatment of osteoporosis.\n\n\nThe inventors have discovered compounds that inhibit 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD1) that are useful in the treatment, control, and/or prevention of disorders (e.g., diseases) that are responsive to the inhibiton of 11 β-HSD1. \n\n - A - SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention pertains to certain amido-isothiazoles (referred to herein as AITZ compounds), as described herein.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention pertains to a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) comprising an AITZ compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention pertains to a method of preparing a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) comprising the step of admixing an AITZ compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of inhibiting 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) function (e.g., in a cell), in vitro or in vivo, comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of an AITZ compound, as described herein.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of treatment comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of an AITZ compound, as described herein, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to an AITZ compound as described herein for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to use of an AITZ compound, as described herein, in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treatment.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the treatment is treatment or prevention of a disorder (e.g., a disease) that is ameliorated by the inhibition of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the treatment is treatment or prevention of metabolic syndrome, which includes conditions such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, and associated disorders including insulin resistance, hypertension, lipid disorders and cardiovascular disorders such as ischaemic (coronary) heart disease.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the treatment is treatment or prevention of a CNS disorder (e.g., a CNS disease) such as mild cognitive impairment and early dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. \n\n Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a kit comprising (a) an AITZ compound, as described herein, preferably provided as a pharmaceutical composition and in a suitable container and/or with suitable packaging;

For example, in one embodiment, the substantially purified form refers to a mixture of stereoisomers, i.e., purified with respect to other compounds. In one embodiment, the substantially purified form refers to one stereoisomer, e.g., optically pure stereoisomer. In one embodiment, the substantially purified form refers to a mixture of enantiomers. In one embodiment, the substantially purified form refers to an equimolar mixture of enantiomers (i.e., a racemic mixture, a racemate). In one embodiment, the substantially purified form refers to one enantiomer, e.g., optically pure enantiomer.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compound is in a form substantially free from contaminants wherein the contaminants represent no more than 50% by weight, e.g., no more than 40% by weight, e.g., no more than 30% by weight, e.g., no more than 20% by weight, \n\n e.g., no more than 10% by weight, e.g., no more than 5% by weight, e.g., no more than 3% by weight, e.g., no more than 2% by weight, e.g., no more than 1% by weight.\n\n\nUnless specified, the contaminants refer to other compounds, that is, other than stereoisomers or enantiomers. In one embodiment, the contaminants refer to other compounds and other stereoisomers. In one embodiment, the contaminants refer to other compounds and the other enantiomer.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compound is in a substantially purified form with an optical purity of at least 60% (i.e., 60% of the compound, on a molar basis, is the desired stereoisomer or enantiomer, and 40% is undesired stereoisomer(s) or enantiomer), e.g., at least 70%, e.g., at least 80%, e.g., at least 90%, e.g., at least 95%, e.g., at least 97%, e.g., at least 98%, e.g., at least 99%.\n\n\nIsomers\n\n\nCertain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and l-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; α- and β-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as \"isomers\" (or \"isomeric forms\").\n\n\nNote that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term \"isomers,\" as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e., isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH\n3\n, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH\n2\nOH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g., C\n1-7\nalkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).\n\n\nThe above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hydroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro. \n\n \n\n\n keto enol enolate\n\n\nNote that specifically included in the term \"isomer\" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including \n1\nH, \n2\nH (D), and \n3\nH (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including \n12\nC, \n13\nC, and \n14\nC; O may be in any isotopic form, including \n16\nO and \n18\nO; and the like.\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including mixtures (e.g., racemic mixtures) thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g., asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g., fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.\n\n\nSalts\n\n\nIt may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et a/., 1977, \"Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts,\" J. Pharm. ScL Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.\n\n\nFor example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO\n\"\n), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na\n+\n and K\n+\n, alkaline earth cations such as Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n, and other cations such as Al\n+3\n. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH\n4\n \n+\n) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH\n3\nR\n+\n, NH\n2\nR\n2\n \n+\n, NHR\n3\n \n+\n, NR\n4\n \n+\n). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH\n3\n)/.\n\n\nIf the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g., -NH\n2\n may be -NH\n3\n \n+\n), then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous. \n\n Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, and valeric. Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes salt forms thereof.\n\n\nHydrates and Solvates\n\n\nIt may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the compound. The term \"solvate\" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g., compound, salt of compound) and solvent. If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes solvate and hydrate forms thereof.\n\n\nChemically Protected Forms\n\n\nIt may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the compound in a chemically protected form. The term \"chemically protected form\" is used herein in the conventional chemical sense and pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions under specified conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, radiation, solvent, and the like). In practice, well known chemical methods are employed to reversibly render unreactive a functional group, which otherwise would be reactive, under specified conditions. In a chemically protected form, one or more reactive functional groups are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 4th Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 2006).\n\n\nA wide variety of such \"protecting,\" \"blocking,\" or \"masking\" methods are widely used and well known in organic synthesis. For example, a compound which has two nonequivalent \n\n reactive functional groups, both of which would be reactive under specified conditions, may be derivatized to render one of the functional groups \"protected,\" and therefore unreactive, under the specified conditions; so protected, the compound may be used as a reactant which has effectively only one reactive functional group. After the desired reaction (involving the other functional group) is complete, the protected group may be \"deprotected\" to return it to its original functionality.\n\n\nFor example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH\n3\n, -OAc).\n\n\nFor example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal (R-CH(OR)\n2\n) or ketal (R\n2\nC(OR)\n2\n), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (>C=0) is converted to a diether (>C(OR)\n2\n), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.\n\n\nFor example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH\n3\n); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CHs)\n2\nC\n6\nH\n4\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9- fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical (>N-0»).\n\n\nFor example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an Ci\n-7\nalkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C\n1-7\nhaloalkyl ester (e.g., a C\n1-7\ntrihaloalkyl ester); a triC\n1-7\nalkylsilyl-C\n1-7\nalkyl ester; or a C\n5-20\naryl-Ci\n-7\nalkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.\n\n\nFor example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH\n2\nNHC(=O)CH\n3\n).\n\n\nProdrugs\n\n\nIt may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the compound in the form of a prodrug. The term \"prodrug,\" as used herein, pertains to a compound which, when metabolised (e.g., in vivo), yields the desired active compound. Typically, the prodrug is inactive, or less active than the desired active compound, but may provide advantageous handling, administration, or metabolic properties. \n\n For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=O)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.\n\n\nAlso, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.\n\n\nChemical Synthesis\n\n\nSeveral methods for the chemical synthesis of AITZ compounds of the present invention are described herein. These and/or other well known methods may be modified and/or adapted in known ways in order to facilitate the synthesis of additional compounds within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nCompositions\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention pertains to a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) comprising an AITZ compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of preparing a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) comprising admixing an AITZ compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.\n\n\nUses\n\n\nThe AITZ compounds, as described herein, are useful, for example, in the treatment of disorders (e.g., diseases) that are ameliorated by the inhibition of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD1), as described herein.\n\n\nUse in Methods of Inhibiting 113-Hvdroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (113-HSD1)\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of inhibiting 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in a cell, in vitro or in vivo, comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of an AITZ compound, as described herein.\n\n\nSuitable assays for determining 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibition are described herein and/or are known in the art. \n\n In one embodiment, the method is performed in vitro.

For example, suitable assays are described herein.\n\n\nFor example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and a compound brought into contact with said cells, and the effect of the compound on those cells observed. As an example of \"effect,\" the morphological status of the cells (e.g., alive or dead, etc.) may be determined. Where the compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may be used as a prognostic or diagnostic marker of the efficacy of the compound in methods of treating a patient carrying cells of the same cellular type.\n\n\nUse in Methods of Therapy\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to an AITZ compound, as described herein, for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.\n\n\nUse in the Manufacture of Medicaments\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to use of an AlTZ compound, as described herein, in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treatment.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the medicament comprises the AITZ compound.\n\n\nMethods of Treatment\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of treatment comprising administering to a patient in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of an AITZ compound, as described herein, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. \n\n Disorders Treated - Disorders Ameliorated by the Inhibition of 11 β-Hvdroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1\n\n\nIn one embodiment (e.g., of use in methods of therapy, of use in the manufacture of medicaments, of methods of treatment), the treatment is treatment or prevention of a disorder (e.g., a disease) that is ameliorated by the inhibition of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1.\n\n\nDisorders Treated - Disorders characterised by Up-Regulation of 11 β-HSD1 etc.\n\n\nIn one embodiment (e.g., of use in methods of therapy, of use in the manufacture of medicaments, of methods of treatment), the treatment is treatment or prevention of a disorder (e.g., a disease) that is characterised by one or more of: up-regulation of 11 β-HSD1 ;

The formulation may further comprise other active agents, for example, other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.\n\n\nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one AITZ compound, as described herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. If formulated as discrete units (e.g., tablets, etc.), each unit contains a predetermined amount (dosage) of the compound.\n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable,\" as used herein, pertains to compounds, ingredients, materials, compositions, dosage forms, etc., which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, diluent, excipient, etc. must also be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\n\n\nSuitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 5th edition, 2005.\n\n\nThe formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the compound with carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the product, if necessary.\n\n\nThe formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate, delayed, timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof.\n\n\nFormulations may suitably be in the form of liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, nonaqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), elixirs, syrups, electuaries, mouthwashes, drops, tablets (including, e.g., coated tablets), granules, powders, losenges, pastilles, capsules (including, e.g., hard and soft gelatin capsules), cachets, pills, ampoules, boluses, suppositories, pessaries, tinctures, gels, pastes, ointments, creams, lotions, oils, foams, sprays, mists, or aerosols.\n\n\nFormulations may suitably be provided as a patch, adhesive plaster, bandage, dressing, or the like which is impregnated with one or more compounds and optionally one or more \n\n other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, including, for example, penetration, permeation, and absorption enhancers. Formulations may also suitably be provided in the form of a depot or reservoir.\n\n\nThe compound may be dissolved in, suspended in, or admixed with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. The compound may be presented in a liposome or other microparticulate which is designed to target the compound, for example, to blood components or one or more organs.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) include liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), elixirs, syrups, electuaries, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, boluses.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for buccal administration include mouthwashes, losenges, pastilles, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, depots, and reservoirs. Losenges typically comprise the compound in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth. Pastilles typically comprise the compound in an inert matrix, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia. Mouthwashes typically comprise the compound in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for sublingual administration include tablets, losenges, pastilles, capsules, and pills.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for oral transmucosal administration include liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil- in-water, water-in-oil), mouthwashes, losenges, pastilles, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, depots, and reservoirs.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for non-oral transmucosal administration include liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), suppositories, pessaries, gels, pastes, ointments, creams, lotions, oils, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, depots, and reservoirs.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for transdermal administration include gels, pastes, ointments, creams, lotions, and oils, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, bandages, dressings, depots, and reservoirs.\n\n\nTablets may be made by conventional means, e.g., compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g., povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g., lactose, \n\n microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid); flavours, flavour enhancing agents, and sweeteners. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with a coating, for example, to affect release, for example an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.\n\n\nOintments are typically prepared from the compound and a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.\n\n\nCreams are typically prepared from the compound and an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-1 ,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the compound through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues.\n\n\nEmulsions are typically prepared from the compound and an oily phase, which may optionally comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), or it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabiliser(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.\n\n\nSuitable emulgents and emulsion stabilisers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulfate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, \n\n 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for intranasal administration, where the carrier is a liquid, include, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebuliser, include aqueous or oily solutions of the compound.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for intranasal administration, where the carrier is a solid, include, for example, those presented as a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for pulmonary administration (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation therapy) include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for ocular administration include eye drops wherein the compound is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the compound.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate; or as a solution or suspension for treatment by enema.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the compound, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which the compound is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or other microparticulate). Such liquids may additionally contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. \n\n Typically, the concentration of the compound in the liquid is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 μg/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 μg/ml. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.\n\n\nDosage\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the AITZ compounds, and compositions comprising the AITZ compounds, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular AITZ compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the AITZ compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, the severity of the disorder, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of AITZ compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.\n\n\nAdministration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician.\n\n\nIn general, a suitable dose of the AITZ compound is in the range of about 10 μg to about 250 mg (more typically about 100 μg to about 25 mg) per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately. \n\n EXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following examples are provided solely to illustrate the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as described herein.\n\n\nAnalytical Method 1 :\n\n\nThe system consisted of a Hewlett Packard HP1100 LC system and a Higgins Clipeus 5 μm C18 100 x 3.0 mm column.

Cells were routinely cultured in DMEM containing 10% calf foetal serum, 1% glutamine, and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin. Prior to assay, cells were plated at 2 x 10\n4\n cells/well in 96-well poly-D-Lys coated flat-bottomed microplates and incubated in 5% CO\n2\n, 95% O\n2\n at 37\n0\nC for 24 hours. The media in each well was removed immediately before assay.\n\n\nCompounds to be tested were dissolved in DMSO at 10 imM and serially diluted into water containing 10% DMSO. Diluted compounds at a volume of 10 μL were added to wells of a 96-well V-bottomed microplate. A solution of DMEM, 1% glutamine, 1 % penicillin and streptomycin, and 22 nM tritiated cortisone was prepared and 90 μL added to each well of the assay plate. This solution (100 μL/well) was transferred to the plate containing the cells. The plate was then incubated in 5% CO\n2\n, 95% O\n2\n at 37\n0\nC for 2 hours.\n\n\nFollowing this incubation, 50 μL of the assay solution was transferred to each well of a 96-well scintillation microplate. A mixture consisting of anti-mouse YSi SPA beads, pre-mixed with anti-cortisol antibody in assay buffer (50 mM Tris.HCI, pH 7.0; 300 mM NaCI; 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) was prepared and 50 μL added to each well of the scintillation microplate. An adhesive strip was applied to the microplate and the plate gently shaken for at least 2 hours at room temperature, and then spun briefly on a low speed centrifuge. The plate was read on a scintillation counter suitable for 96-well microplates. For the calculation of percentage inhibition, a series of wells were added to the plate that represented the assay maximum and the assay minimum: one set that contained substrate without cells (mimimum) and another set that contained substrate and cells without any compound (maximum).\n\n\nThe calculation of median inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) values for the compounds was performed using GraphPad Prism® software. Dose-response curves for each compound were plotted as fractional inhibition and data fitted to the four parameter logistic equation.\n\n\nCellular In Vitro 11 S-HSD2 Enzyme Inhibition Assay\n\n\nFor measurement of inhibition of 11 β-HSD2, CHO cells stably transfected with the full- length gene coding for human 11 β-HSD2 were used. Assays were carried out in 96-well microplates containing 1 x 10\n5\n cells/well. Controls and compounds were plated as above, \n\n so that the final DMSO concentration in each well was 1 %. To initiate the assay, 90 μL of a solution of HAMS F-12 medium containing 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 22 nM tritiated Cortisol was added to each well of the assay plate. The plate was then incubated in 5% CO\n2\n, 95% O\n2\n at 37\n0\nC for 16 hours.\n\n\nThe assay solutions were transferred to glass tubes and 20 μL ethyl acetate added to each tube. Each tube was vortexed thoroughly and the upper layer containing the tritiated steroid transferred to a fresh glass tube. The solvent was evaporated by placing the tubes in a heating block at 65\n0\nC under a stream of Nitrogen gas. 20 μL ethanol was added to each of the dried samples and vortexed briefly. Each sample was applied to a silica TLC plate and the plate dried. The plate was placed vertically in a glass tank containing 92% chloroform : 8% ethanol and the solvent allowed to rise up the plate. The plate was dried, placed in an imaging cassette, and overlayed with a tritium imaging plate for 1-2 days. The amount of enzyme inhibition in each sample was determined by measuring the intensity of the substrate and product spots using a phosphoimager.\n\n\nIC\n50\n values for inhibitors were determined as described for 11β-HSD1.\n\n\nBiological Data\n\n\nCellular In Vitro Enzyme Inhibition Data\n\n\nThe following compounds were tested using the cellular in vitro enzyme inhibition assays described above: AA-01 , AA-02, BB-01 , BB-02, BB-03, CC-01 , CC-02.\n\n\nPreferably, the compounds selectively inhibit 11 β-HSD1 (i.e., have a low value for the IC\n50\n for 11β-HSD1) as compared to 11 β-HSD2 (i.e., have a high value for the IC\n50\n for 11 β-HSD2).\n\n\nAll of the compounds tested have an IC\n50\n for 11 β-HSD1 of less than about 3 μM, and in most cases less than about 0.5 μM. All of the compounds tested have an IC\n50\n for 11 β-HSD2 of more than 10,000 nM. All of the compounds tested have an IC\n50\n ratio for 11 β-HSD2 to 11 β-HSD1 of at least about five or greater, and in many cases ten or greater. For example, data for some of the compounds is shown in the following table.\n\n\n \n\n The following compounds have an IC\n50\n for 11 β-HSD1 of less than or equal to 500 nM (0.5 μM), and an IC\n50\n for 11 β-HSD2 of >10,000 nM: AA-01 , AA-02, BB-01 , BB-02, BB-03, CC-01.\n\n\nThe foregoing has described the principles, preferred embodiments, and modes of operation of the present invention.
