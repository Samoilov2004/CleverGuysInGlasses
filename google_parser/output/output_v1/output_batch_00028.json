The invention as described hereinabove.\n\n\n*** Description\n\n\n\n\n ISOXAZOLE-THIAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS GABA A RECEPTOR INVERSE AGONISTS FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF COGNITIVE DISORDERS\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with isoxazole-thiazole derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A Î±5 receptors, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as therapeutically active substances.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention is concerned with isoxazole-thiazole derivatives of formula I,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the substituents and variables are as described below and in the claims.\n\n\nBackground Art\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand- gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of Î±, Î² and Î³ subunits. Presently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (Î±, Î² and Î³) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the Î± and Î³ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, Î±lÎ²2Î³2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas Î±2Î²2Î³2, Î±3Î²2Î³2 and Î±5Î²2Î³2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21 :101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Î²-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, Î²-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A Î±5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity \n\n at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor can be used to provide a therapeutically active substance which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A Î±5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor but which are functionally selective for Î±5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A Î±5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 receptor are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A Î±5 subunits and the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of various diseases and disorders of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381, 108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer.

The invention as described hereinabove. Description\n\n\n\n\n ISOXAZOLE-PYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyrazole derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A Î±5 receptor, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention provides isoxazole-pyrazole derivatives of formula I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the substituents are as described below and in the claims.\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand- gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally ofÎ±, Î² and Î³ subunits.\n\n\nBackground Art\n\n\nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (Î±, Î² and Î³) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the Î± and Î³ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, Î±lÎ²2Î³2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas Î±2Î²2Î³2, Î±3Î²2Î³2 and Î±5Î²2Î³2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21 :101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Î²-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, Î²-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A Î±5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity \n\n at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A Î±5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor but which are functionally selective for Î±5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A Î±5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 receptor are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A Î±5 subunits and the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of various diseases and disorders of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381, 108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer. J. Med. Genetics, 2004, 13 IB, 51-9, Autism 2007, 11(2): 135-47, Investigacion Clinica, 2007, 48, 529-41, Nature Neuroscience, 2007, 10, 411-13, Neuroscience Letts., 2008, 433, 22-7 and Cell 2008, 135, 549-60.\n\n\nDetailed description of the invention\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters pharmaceutical compositions containing them, methods for their manufacture, and theuse of the above mentioned compounds in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases and disorders related to the GABA A Î±5 receptor.

The products can usually be isolated by filtration or by chromatography. The conversion of a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with a base can be carried out by treatment of such a compound with such a base. One possible method to form such a salt is e.g. by addition of 1/n equivalents of a basic salt such as e.g. M(OH)\nn\n, wherein M = metal or ammonium cation and n = number of hydroxide anions, to a solution of the compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol, ethanol-water mixture, tetrahydrofuran- water mixture) and to remove the solvent by evaporation or lyophilisation.\n\n\nThe conversion into pharmaceutically acceptable esters of compounds of formula I bearing a carboxy group can be carried out e.g. by treatment of a suitable carboxy group with a suitable alcohol using e.g. a condensating reagent such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)- phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), N,N-dicylohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC), N-(3- dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) or O-(l,2-dihydro-2-oxo-l- \n\n pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluronium-tetrafluoro-borate (TPTU), or by direct reaction with a suitable alcohol under acidic conditions, as for example in the presence of a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. The conversion into pharmaceutically acceptable esters of compounds of formula I bearing a hydroxy group can be carried out with suitable acids by analogous methods.\n\n\nInsofar as their preparation is not described in the examples, the compounds of formula I as well as all intermediate products can be prepared according to analogous methods or according to the methods set forth herewithin. Starting materials are commercially available, known in the art or can be prepared by methods known in the art or in analogy thereto.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of general formula I in this invention can be derivatised at functional groups to provide derivatives which are capable of conversion back to the parent compound in vivo.\n\n\nPharmacological Tests\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters possess valuable pharmacological properties. Compounds of the present invention are ligands for GABA A receptors containing the Î±5 subunit and are therefore useful in the therapy where cognition enhancement is required.\n\n\nThe compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter:\n\n\nMembrane preparation and binding assay\n\n\nThe affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [3H]flumazenil (85 Ci/mmol; Roche) binding to HEK293 cells expressing rat (stably transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition Î±lÎ²3Î³2, Î±2Î²3Î³2, Î±3Î²3Î³2 and Î±5Î²3Î³2.\n\n\nCell pellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 20 sec on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 4 \n0\nC (50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24 = 20000 rpm). The cell pellets were re-suspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 \n0\nC.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell membranes, [\n3\nH]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 subunits and 0.5 nM for Î±5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n3\n x 10\n\"6\n M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n\"5\n M diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of \n\n the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 \n0\nC and harvested onto GF/C uni-fÏlters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of\n\n\n[\n3\nH]flumazenil from Î±5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM) < 35. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are binding selective for the Î±5 subunit relative to the Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 subunit.\n\n\nRepresentative test results are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: human Ki (hKi) values\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.

Oral pharmaceutical compositions are e.g. tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard gelatin capsules, soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. Rectal pharmaceutical compositions are e.g. in the form of suppositories.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Examples are lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatin capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc. Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc. Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc. Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. \n\n The dosage, at which compounds of the invention can be administered, can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof. The daily dosage can be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.\n\n\nExamples of compositions according to the invention are, but are not limited to:\n\n\nExample A\n\n\nTablets of the following composition are manufactured in the usual manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: possible tablet composition\n\n\nManufacturing Procedure\n\n\n1.

The invention as described hereinabove. Description\n\n\n\n\n ISOXAZOLE-PYRIDAZINE DERIVATIVES\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridazine derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A Î±5 receptor, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as therapeutically active substances.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridazine derivatives of formula I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the substituents are as described below and in the claims.\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand- gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of Î±, Î² and Î³ subunits.\n\n\nBackground Art\n\n\nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (Î±, Î² and Î³) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the Î± and Î³ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, Î±lÎ²2Î³2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas Î±2Î²2Î³2, Î±3Î²2Î³2 and Î±5Î²2Î³2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21 : 101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Î²-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, Î²-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists\n\n\nSMU / 16.02.2010 \n\n are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A Î±5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor can be used to provide a therapeutically active substance which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A Î±5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor but which are functionally selective for Î±5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A Î±5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 receptor are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A Î±5 subunits and the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of various diseases of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381, 108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer. J. Med. Genetics, 2004, 131B, 51-9, Autism 2007, 11(2): 135-47, Investigacion Clinica, 2007, 48, 529-41, Nature Neuroscience, 2007, 10, 411-13, Neuroscience Letts., 2008, 433, 22-7 and Cell 2008, 135, 549-60.\n\n\nDetailed description of the invention\n\n\nObjects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters, the preparation of the above mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above mentioned compounds in the treatment or prevention of diseases related to the GABA A Î±5 receptor. The compounds of present invention are preferably inverse agonists of GABA A Î±5.\n\n\nThe compounds of present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used, alone or in combination with other drugs, as cognitive enhancers or for the treatment or prevention of acute neurological disorders, chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, memory deficits, schizophrenia, positive, negative and/or cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, autism, Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I, sleep disorders, disorders of circadian rhythms, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, psychotic disorders, substance-induced psychotic disorder, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, delusional disorder, obsessive/compulsive disorders, acute stress disorder, drug addictions, movement disorders, Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, cognition deficiency disorders, multi-infarct dementia, mood disorders, depression, neuropsychiatric conditions, psychosis, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, neuropathic pain, stroke and attentional disorders.\n\n\nThe following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination. \n\n The term \"lower alkyl\", alone or in combination with other groups, stands for a hydrocarbon radical which may be linear or branched, with single or multiple branching, whereby the alkyl group in general comprises 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example, methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl, isopropyl (i-propyl), n-butyl, i-butyl (iso-butyl), 2-butyl (sec-butyl), t-butyl (tert-butyl) and the like.

Additional asymmetric centres may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric centre will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology \n\n disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric centre of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography.\n\n\nSubstituents at a double bond or a ring may be present in cis (=Z-) or trans (=E-) form, unless the stereochemistry is explicitly depicted in the corresponding compound formula I.\n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutical composition\" encompasses a product comprising specified ingredients in pre- determined amounts or proportions, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combining specified ingredients in specified amounts. Preferably it encompasses a product comprising one or more active ingredients, and an optional carrier comprising inert ingredients, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients.\n\n\nThe following table lists abbreviations used within the present document.\n\n\nCDI l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole\n\n\nDCM dichloromethane\n\n\nDIPEA N,N-diisopropylethylamine (HÏnig's Base)\n\n\nDMAP N,N-dimethylamino-4-pyridine\n\n\nDMF N,N-dimethylformamide\n\n\nDMSO dimethylsulfoxide\n\n\nDPPF 1 , 1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene\n\n\nEDAC l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride h hour(s)\n\n\nHOBt N-1-hydroxybenzotriazole\n\n\nLiOH, NaOH lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide\n\n\nMesAl trimethylaluminium\n\n\nMeOH, EtOH methanol, ethanol\n\n\nMS mass spectrum\n\n\nNa\n2\nCÎ¸3 sodium carbonate\n\n\nNADP nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n\n\nNaH sodium hydride on overnight \n\n Pd(OAc)\n2\n palladium acetate rt room temperature\n\n\nSeignette's salt potassium sodium tartrate\n\n\nTBD l,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene\n\n\nTBDMS tert-butyldimethylsilyl\n\n\nTBTU O-(benzotriazol- 1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate\n\n\nTHF tetrahydrofuran\n\n\nTable 1 : abbreviations\n\n\nThe invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions, methods of using, and methods of preparing the aforementioned compounds.\n\n\nWhile the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n\n\nIn addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process step or steps, to the objective spirit and scope of the present invention.

The invention as described hereinabove.\n\n\n*** Description\n\n\n\n\n ISOXAZOLE-PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with isoxazo Ie -pyridine derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A Î±5 receptor, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridine derivatives of formula I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the substituents are as described below and in the claims.\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand- gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of Î±, Î² and Î³ subunits.\n\n\nBackground Art\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand- gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of Î±, Î² and Î³ subunits. Presently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (Î±, Î² and Î³) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological \n\n functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the Î± and Î³ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, Î±lÎ²2Î³2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas Î±2Î²2Î³2, Î±3Î²2Î³2 and Î±5Î²2Î³2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21 :101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Î²-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, Î²-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A Î±5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor can be used to provide a therapeutically active substance which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A Î±5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A Î±l and/or Î±2 and/or Î±3 receptor but which are functionally selective for Î±5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A Î±5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 receptor are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A Î±5 subunits and the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of various diseases and disorders of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381, 108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer.

The products can usually be isolated by filtration or by chromatography.\n\n\nThe conversion of a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with a base \n\n can be carried out by treatment of such a compound with such a base. One possible method to form such a salt is e.g. by addition of 1/n equivalents of a basic salt such as e.g. M(OH)\nn\n, wherein M = metal or ammonium cation and n = number of hydroxide anions, to a solution of the compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol, ethanol-water mixture, tetrahydrofuran- water mixture) and to remove the solvent by evaporation or lyophilisation.\n\n\nThe conversion into pharmaceutically acceptable esters of compounds of formula I bearing a carboxy group can be carried out e.g. by treatment of a suitable carboxy group with a suitable alcohol using e.g. a condensating reagent such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)- phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), N,N-dicylohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC), N-(3- dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) or O-(l,2-dihydro-2-oxo-l- pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluronium-tetrafluoro-borate (TPTU), or by direct reaction with a suitable alcohol under acidic conditions, as for example in the presence of a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like.

It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are ligands for GABA A receptors containing the Î±5 subunit and are therefore useful in the therapy where cognition enhancement is required.\n\n\nThe compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter:\n\n\nMembrane preparation and binding assay\n\n\nThe affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [\n3\nH]flumazenil (85 Ci/mmol; Roche) binding to HEK293 cells expressing rat (stably transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition Î±lÎ²3Î³2, Î±2Î²3Î³2, Î±3Î²3Î³2 and Î±5Î²3Î³2.\n\n\nCell pellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 20 sec on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 4 \n0\nC (50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24 = 20000 rpm). The cell pellets were re-suspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 \n0\nC.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell membranes, [\n3\nH]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 subunits and 0.5 nM for Î±5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n3\n x 10\n\"6\n M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n\"5\n M diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 \n0\nC and harvested onto GF/C uni-fÏlters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [\n3\nH]flumazenil from Î±5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM) < 35. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are binding selective for the Î±5 subunit relative to the Î±l, Î±2 and Î±3 subunit.
