Description\n\n\n\n\n 4-AZOLYLAMINOQUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF \n\n\n USE THEREOF\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional\n\n\nApplication No. 61/379,320, filed September 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n FIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The \n\n\ncompounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). The family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well \n\n characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n\nphosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. Exemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of- function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 76», 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

EMBO \n\n\n2002 21(9), 2159-2167. \n\n\n [0007] Literature indicates that JAK may also serve as a target for prostate cancer, including androgen-resistant prostate cancer. See, Barton et al. Mol. Cane. Ther. 2004 3(1), 11-20, Blume- Jensen et al. Nature (2001) 411(6835):355-356,Bromberg J /m Invest. (2002) 109(9): 1139-1142 and Rane Oncogene (2000) 19(49):5662-5679. JAK \n\n as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. See, Borie et al., Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et al., Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14): l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TGI 01209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et al. \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21 : 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibtors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.

and 2-(difluoro(4-fluorophenyl)methyl)-N-( 1 -methyl- 1 H-imidazol-4-yl)quinazolin-4- amine, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or hydrates thereof. \n\n\n[00103] Also provided herein are isotopically enriched analogs of the compounds provided herein. Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, Metabolism, 43: 487 (1994); \n\n\nGately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00104] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the \n\n amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00105] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [00106] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n C.

Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00159] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999). \n\n\n [00160] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n[00161] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), \n\n carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), \n\n\nhydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. \n\n\n[00162] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered.

Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00165] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n [00166] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslmked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose \n\n (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00167] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffmose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00168] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MA NOGEM\n™\n EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n[00169] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00170] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, \n\n cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n [00171] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00172] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post- coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00173] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n [00174] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00175] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, \n\n\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). \n\n\n[00176] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers.

Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller- compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n [00179] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00193] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g. , March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash \n\n\nchromatography (Still et al. (1978) J Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n [00194] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00195] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00196] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00197] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00198] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00199] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00200] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n DCM dichloromethane \n\n\n DIEA diisopropylethylamine \n\n\n EDCI N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide \n\n\n hydrochloride \n\n\n EtOAc ethyl acetate \n\n\n EtOH ethanol \n\n\n FBS fetal bovine serum \n\n\n HATU 0-(7-Azabenzotriazol- 1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'- tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate \n\n\n HOAc acetic acid \n\n\n HOBt N-hydroxybenzotriazole \n\n\n MeOH methanol \n\n\n TEA Triethylamine \n\n\n Trityl Triphenylmethyl \n\n\n[00201] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00202] As illustrated in Scheme 1, an appropriate anthranilamide derivative 1 can be transformed to a 2-carboxylate substituted quinazoline 2 by treatement with an activated oxalic acid derivative such as a dialkyl oxalate either neat or in a suitable solvent such as EtOH or HOAc with heating as required. Alternatively, 1 is treated with an oxalic acid monoalkyl ester chloride in a suitable solvent such as DCM in the presence of a base such as TEA and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as DMAP; or 1 is treated with a cyano oxoacetate monoalkyl ester with heating in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF in the presence of a base such as TEA. Subsequent treatment under dehydrating conditions, for example, heating with or without TMSCl in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA in a suitable solvent such as DCE affords the quinazoline 2. Treatment of 2 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 3. Alternatively, 2 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide to form 3 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 2 may also be transformed into 3 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by \n\n alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Treatment of 3 with a metalloarene, for example an aryl lithium or an aryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, produces ketone 4. Subsequent conversion of 4 to 5 is accomplished by treatment of 4 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required. \n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00203] As illustrated in Scheme 2, anthranilamides 1 may be condensed with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 6 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSCl in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxyquinazoline derivatives 7. Alternatively, heating of 1 with a carboxylic acid (6, Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 7. Treatment of 7 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 8. Alternatively, 7 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 8 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 7 may also be transformed into 8 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Subsequent conversion of 8 to 9 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 4 to 5. \n\n Scheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9 \n\n\n [00204] In Scheme 3 are illustrated representative examples by which the keto group in 5 can be further modified to afford additional compounds of the invention. Treatment of 5 with Lawesson's reagent affords thioketones 10. Treatment of 5 with an amine, hydroxylamine, or alkoxylamine under dehydrating conditions optionally in the presence of acid with heating affords, respectively, imines, oximes, or O-alkyl oximes 11. Treatment of 5 with a Wittig reagent or Horner-Emmons reagent affords olefins 12. Treatment of 5 with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride affords secondary alcohols 13. Treatment of 5 with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound affords tertiary alcohols 14. Heating 5 with an alcohol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords ketals 15. Heating 5 with a 1,2- 1,3- or 1,4-diol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords cyclic ketals 16. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scheme 3 (continued) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00205] In Scheme 4 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 6 used in Scheme 2. A carboxylic acid derivative 17, where Y' is for example alkoxy or a subsequently removable chiral auxiliary, is deprotonated at the alpha position with a strong base and treated with an alkylating agent to afford 18. The sequence is repeated with the same or a different alkylating agent to form 19. The Y' group of 19 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 6 that is suitable for use in Scheme 2. \n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n 17 18 19 \n\n\n ► 6 \n\n\n [00206] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that standard functional group manipulations may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention from products or intermediates prepared as described by the foregoing methods. In Scheme 5 are shown representative examples that are intended to illustrate, but in no way to limit the scope of, such standard functional group manipulations. \n\n Scheme 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R\n13\n = heteroaryl, -C(0)-R\nv<\n C(0)OR\nw\n, \n\n Scheme 5 continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26 \n\n\n 27 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00207] Aminoazole or azolyl amine intermediates employed herein may be obtained either via commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Scheme 6 illustrates representative methods that may be employed for the preparation of additional aminoazoles or azolyl amines. For example, nitroazoles 31 may be converted to aminoazoles 32 via treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n in a suitable solvent such as DCE or EtOH optionally in the presence of HC1, with heating. Alternatively, treatment of 31 with activated iron or zinc metal in HO Ac with heating, will afford 32. Alternatively, treatment of 31 with palladium metal on activated carbon in the presence of > 1 atmosphere pressure of hydrogen gas, in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or EtOAc or mixtures of these, at rt or with heating as required, will afford 32. Alternatively treatment of 31 with sodium hydrosulfite in a suitable solvent mixture such as THF and water at rt or \n\n with heating as required, will afford 32. Alternatively, aminoazoles 32 may also be obtained from azole carboxylic acids 33 via initial treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, followed by hydrolysis. Alternatively, treatment of 33 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in the presence of excess tert-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, will afford a tert-butylcarbamoyl azole intermediate, which upon treatment with an acid such as TFA or HC1 in a suitable solvent, will afford 32. \n\n\nAminoazoles 32 may also be obtained from azolyl bromides or iodides 34, bearing (as required) suitable protecting groups on any azole ring N-H positions, via initial treatment with a suitable amino containing reagent (where P = protecting group), such as benzophenone imine, 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, or tert-butyl carbamate, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable organopalladium-complex, and optionally in the presence of a suitable phosphine-ligand, and optionally in the presence of a suitable base, and in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature or under microwave conditions, to afford intermediate 35. Subsequent N-deprotection of intermediate 35 (including azole ring N-deprotection, where required), employing appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art will afford 32. Conversion of aminoazoles 32 to alkylated aminoazoles 36 may be achieved via treatment of 32 with an appropriate aldehyde or ketone substrate, in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as TMSC1 or TiCl\n4\n and a reducing agent such as sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, THF, or MeOH, optionally in the presence of HO Ac, at rt or with heating as required. \n\n\nAlternatively, 36 may be obtained via treatment of 32 with an alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable organic base such as pyridine or DIEA, and sodium or potassium iodide, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF or THF, at rt or with heating as required. Nitroazoles 31, azole carboxylic acids 33, and azole bromides or iodides 34 may be obtained from commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n Scheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n 31 32 \n\n\n \n\n 34 \n\n\n P = protecting group \n\n\n\n\n\n 32 36 \n\n\n [00208] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation. Thus, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that conditions such as choice of solvent, temperature of reaction, volumes, reaction time may vary while still producing the desired compounds. In addition, one of skill in the art will also appreciate that many of the reagents provided in the following examples may be substituted with other suitable reagents. See, e.g., Smith & March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5\nth\n ed. (2001). Such changes and modifications, including without limitation those relating to the chemical structures, substituents, derivatives, intermediates, syntheses, formulations and/or methods of use provided herein, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.

Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage {See, Fabian et al or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\nBinding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- well plates in a final volume of 34 \\iL, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 iL. The assay plates were \n\n incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S10, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386 kinases. \n\n\n[00229] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2.

After 16 hour incubation, cells were seeded at 2xl0\n5\n cell/well in 50 μΐ volume, into Costar, clear bottom, 96- well assay plates. Serial dilutions of compounds were added to the plates with final DMSO concentration at 0.5% and GM-CSF at 2ng/mL and the plates were then incubated at 30°C and 5% C0\n2\n for 4 hours. The plates were brought to room temperature before adding Substrate Mixture according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Catalog # K1085).

Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n The family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n\nphosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. Exemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of- function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 76», 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

Cane. Ther. 2004 \n\n 3(1), 11-20, Blume- Jensen et al. Nature (2001) 411(6835):355-356, Bromberg J C/m Invest. (2002) 109(9): 1139-1142, and Rane Oncogene (2000) 19(49):5662-5679. JAK as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. See, Borie et al., Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et al., Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14): l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TGI 01209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et al. \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21 : 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibtors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.

Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or be stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures. \n\n [0063] It is to be understood that the compounds provided herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. \n\n\n [0064] Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as reverse phase HPLC or by crystallization. \n\n\n[0065] As used herein, the term \"enantiomerically pure\" or \"pure enantiomer\" denotes that the compound comprises more than 75% by weight, more than 80% by weight, more than 85% by weight, more than 90%> by weight, more than 91 > by weight, more than 92% by weight, more than 93% by weight, more than 94% by weight, more than 95% by weight, more than 96%> by weight, more than 97% by weight, more than 98%> by weight, more than 98.5% by weight, more than 99% by weight, more than 99.2% by weight, more than 99.5% by weight, more than 99.6% by weight, more than 99.7% by weight, more than 99.8% by weight or more than 99.9% by weight, of the desired enantiomer. \n\n\n [0066] Where the number of any given substituent is not specified (e.g. , haloalkyl), there may be one or more substituents present.

Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, Metabolism, 43: 487 (1994); \n\n\nGately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [0096] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of \n\n active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[0097] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [0098] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n C.

Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; \n\n\n5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; \n\n\n5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; \n\n\n6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; and 6,699,500. \n\n\n1. Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00151] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those \n\n skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999). \n\n\n [00152] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n[00153] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), \n\n\nhydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. \n\n\n[00154] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device included, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, \n\n polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polymethylmethacrylate, \n\n\npolybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate- methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, \n\n\nethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and \n\n\nethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, \n\n\npolydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, and ; hydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides. \n\n\n [00155] In a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions. \n\n\n[00156] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, melt-granulation followed by compression. \n\n\n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00157] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an \n\n aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n [00158] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00159] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffmose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00160] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For \n\n example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n[00161] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00162] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n [00163] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. \n\n 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00164] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post- coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00165] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n\n [00166] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00167] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, \n\n\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). \n\n\n[00168] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. See, U.S. Pat. No. \n\n\n5,612,059 and WO 2002/17918. The AMT controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in \n\n the art, including direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, and a dip- coating method. \n\n\n [00169] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as ESC controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s), a hydroxylethyl cellulose, and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n3. Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n [00170] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μιη to about 3 mm, about 50 μιη to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μιη to about 1 mm in diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller- compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n\n [00171] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4. Targeted Delivery \n\n\n [00172] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated, including liposome-, resealed erythrocyte-, and antibody-based delivery systems.

Nos. 6,316,652; \n\n\n6,274,552; 6,271,359; 6,253,872; 6,139,865; 6,131,570; 6,120,751; 6,071,495; \n\n 6,060,082; 6,048,736; 6,039,975; 6,004,534; 5,985,307; 5,972,366; 5,900,252; \n\n\n5,840,674; 5,759,542; and 5,709,874. \n\n\n D. EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00173] Standard physiological, pharmacological and biochemical procedures are available for testing the compounds to identify those that possess biological activities that modulate the activity of JAK kinases, including wild type and mutant JAK kinases. Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, see, Fabian et al, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23,329-336, radioactivity incorporation assays, as well as a variety of cell based assays. \n\n\n [00174] Exemplary cell based assay methodologies include measurement of STAT5A phosphorylation, for example, by ELISA or the measurement of proliferation in leukemic cell lines such as TF-1 or HEL-2, for example, by BrdU incorporation, by fluorescent staining or by a reporter assay activated by the transcription factor STAT5. Cells useful in the assays include cells with wildtype JAK such as TF-1 or mutated JAK such as the cell line HEL-2 which express a constitutively active JAK2 carrying the V617F mutation. Suitable cells include those derived through cell culture from patient samples as well as cells derived using routine molecular biology techniques, e.g., retroviral transduction, transfection, mutagenesis, etc. \n\n\n E.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00185] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g. , March Advanced \n\n Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash \n\n\nchromatography (Still et al. (1978) J Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n\n [00186] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00187] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl {e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the \n\n like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00188] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00189] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00190] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00191] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00192] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n\n \n\n MeOH methanol \n\n\n TEA Triethylamine \n\n\n Trityl Triphenylmethyl \n\n\n[00193] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00194] As illustrated in Scheme 1, an anthranilamide 1 can be transformed into 4- hydroxyquinazolines 4 by treatment with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 2 to form amide 3 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, by heat or with TMSC1 in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIE A, or pyridine. Alternatively, heating of 1 with a carboxylic acid 2 (Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 3. Treatment of 3 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms a 4-halo derivative 5. Alternatively, 4 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 6 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 4 may be transformed into 5 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Treatment of 5 with an aminopyrazole with heating as required in the presence of base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 6. Any functional groups present in ring D that would be incompatible with the above transformations may be protected with a suitable protecting group, as described by Greene in \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\", followed by deprotection at an appropriate stage of the synthesis. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00195] In Scheme 2 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 2 used in Scheme 1. A phenylacetic acid derivative 7 is treated an alkylmagnesium halide, followed by a epihalohydrin to form 8 which is selectively produced in the cis configuration (see WO2007/038452 Al). Protection of the carboxylic acid affords 9, wherein Y' is alkoxy, for example). The configuration at the hydroxyl group of 9 may optionally be inverted to via a Mitsunobu reaction with a carboxylic acid followed by deacylation to form 10. The Y' group of 9 or 10 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to a Y group of 2 that is suitable for use in Scheme 1. \n\n\n Scheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n[00196] In Scheme 3 are illustrated useful methods for transformations of phenylacetonitriles 14 to carboxylic acid derivatives 26 or 27, which are variants of 2 \n\n that can be incorporated into the methods of Scheme 1. Conversion of 20 to 24 is accomplished as demonstrated in WO2008/077556 Al over 4 steps. Subsequent removal of the dioxolane ring under aqueous acidic conditions, followed by protection of the carboxylic acid affords ketone 25, which may be reduced to give alcohols 26 and 27 as separable diastereomers. It is envisioned that alcohols 26 and 27 maybe further transformed in an analogous manner as alcohols 9 and 10 as described in Scheme 3. It is also envisioned that ketone 25 maybe further transformed in an analogous manner as ketone 14 in Scheme 4. \n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00197] In Scheme 4 are illustrated useful methods for transformations of ketones 14 or 25 to additional variants of acid 2. Treatment of 14 or 25 with a suitable amine, under reductive amination conditions well known in the art, for example treatment with sodium triacetoxyborohydride in DCE, forms amines 15.

Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage {See, Fabian et al or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\nBinding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- well plates in a final volume of 34 \\iL, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 iL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with \n\n wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S10, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386 kinases. \n\n\n[00223] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 10 μΜ against JAK2.

The cell line contains stably integrated beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of the regulatory factor 1 (irf 1) response element recognized by the activated \n\n transcription factor STAT5. csTF-1 cells (Invitrogen K1219) were washed with assay media (97%OPTIMEM/ 0.5%dialyzed FBS/ O.lmM NEAA/ ImM Na pyr/ P/S) and seeded in the same media at 5xl0\n5\n cell/mL in T150 flask. After 16 hour incubation, cells were seeded at 2xl0\n5\n cell/well in 50 μΐ volume, into Costar, clear bottom, 96- well assay plates. Serial dilutions of compounds were added to the plates with final DMSO concentration at 0.5% and GM-CSF at 2ng/mL and the plates were then incubated at 30°C and 5% C0\n2\n for 4 hours. The plates were brought to room temperature before adding Substrate Mixture according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Catalog # K1085). The assay plates containing the substrate mixture were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 hours.

Description\n\n\n\n\n AZOLOPYRIDINE AND AZOLOPYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF \n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional\n\n\nApplication No. 61/379,306, filed September 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n FIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The compounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin- 1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). The family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to \n\n phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n\nphosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. Exemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of-function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 70, 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

EMBO 2002 21(9), 2159-2167. \n\n\n [0007] Literature indicates that JAK may also serve as a target for prostate cancer, including androgen-resistant prostate cancer. See, Barton et al. Mol. Cane. Ther. 2004 3(1), 1 1-20, Blume- Jensen et al. Nature (2001) 41 1(6835):355-356 and Bromberg J Clin Invest. (2002) 109(9): 1139-1142, Rane Oncogene (2000) 19(49):5662-5679. JAK as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. See, Borie et al., \n\n Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et al, Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14): l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TGI 01209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et al. \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21: 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibtors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.

In another embodiment, provided herein are compounds selected from l-ethyl-6-((4- fluorophenyl)thio)-N-(5 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazol-3 -yl)- 1 H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4- amine and \n\n\n 2-cyclopentyl-6-(difluoro(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)methyl)-N-(5-methyl-lH-pyrazol-3- yl)-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or hydrates thereof. \n\n\n [00133] Also provided herein are isotopically enriched analogs of the compounds provided herein. Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al, J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, Metabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. 117: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00134] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00135] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction {i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol, vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n [00136] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT2O. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n C.

Enteric-coated tablets are compressed tablets coated with substances that resist the action of stomach acid but dissolve or disintegrate in the intestine, thus protecting the active ingredients from the acidic environment of the stomach. Enteric- coatings include, but are not limited to, fatty acids, fats, phenyl salicylate, waxes, \n\n shellac, ammoniated shellac, and cellulose acetate phthalates. Sugar-coated tablets are compressed tablets surrounded by a sugar coating, which may be beneficial in covering up objectionable tastes or odors and in protecting the tablets from oxidation. Film-coated tablets are compressed tablets that are covered with a thin layer or film of a water-soluble material. Film coatings include, but are not limited to, \n\n\nhydroxyethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol 4000, and cellulose acetate phthalate. Film coating imparts the same general characteristics as sugar coating. Multiple compressed tablets are compressed tablets made by more than one compression cycle, including layered tablets, and press-coated or dry-coated tablets. \n\n\n [00152] The tablet dosage forms can be prepared from the active ingredient in powdered, crystalline, or granular forms, alone or in combination with one or more carriers or excipients described herein, including binders, disintegrants, controlled- release polymers, lubricants, diluents, and/or colorants. Flavoring and sweetening agents are especially useful in the formation of chewable tablets and lozenges. \n\n\n[00153] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be provided as soft or hard capsules, which can be made from gelatin, methylcellulose, starch, or calcium alginate. The hard gelatin capsule, also known as the dry-filled capsule (DFC), consists of two sections, one slipping over the other, thus completely enclosing the active ingredient. The soft elastic capsule (SEC) is a soft, globular shell, such as a gelatin shell, which is plasticized by the addition of glycerin, sorbitol, or a similar polyol. The soft gelatin shells may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Suitable preservatives are those as described herein, including methyl- and propyl-parabens, and sorbic acid. The liquid, semisolid, and solid dosage forms provided herein may be encapsulated in a capsule. Suitable liquid and semisolid dosage forms include solutions and suspensions in propylene carbonate, vegetable oils, or triglycerides. Capsules containing such solutions can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,328,245; 4,409,239; and 4,410,545. The capsules may also be coated as known by those of skill in the art in order to modify or sustain dissolution of the active ingredient. \n\n\n [00154] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be provided in liquid and semisolid dosage forms, including emulsions, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, and syrups. An emulsion is a two-phase system, in which one liquid is \n\n dispersed in the form of small globules throughout another liquid, which can be oil-in- water or water-in-oil. Emulsions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable nonaqueous liquid or solvent, emulsifying agent, and preservative. Suspensions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agent and preservative. Aqueous alcoholic solutions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable acetal, such as a di(lower alkyl) acetal of a lower alkyl aldehyde, e.g., acetaldehyde diethyl acetal; and a water-miscible solvent having one or more hydroxyl groups, such as propylene glycol and ethanol. Elixirs are clear, sweetened, and hydroalcoholic solutions. \n\n\nSyrups are concentrated aqueous solutions of a sugar, for example, sucrose, and may also contain a preservative. For a liquid dosage form, for example, a solution in a polyethylene glycol may be diluted with a sufficient quantity of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, e.g., water, to be measured conveniently for administration. \n\n\n[00155] Other useful liquid and semisolid dosage forms include, but are not limited to, those containing the active ingredient(s) provided herein, and a dialkylated mono- or poly-alkylene glycol, including, 1 ,2-dimethoxymethane, diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, polyethylene glycol-350-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-550- dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-750-dimethyl ether, wherein 350, 550, and 750 refer to the approximate average molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol. These formulations can further comprise one or more antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, vitamin E, hydroquinone, hydroxycoumarins, ethanolamine, lecithin, cephalin, ascorbic acid, malic acid, sorbitol, phosphoric acid, bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, thiodipropionic acid and its esters, and dithiocarbamates. \n\n\n [00156] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein for oral administration can be also provided in the forms of liposomes, micelles, microspheres, or nanosystems.

Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00189] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999). \n\n\n [00190] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n[00191] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), \n\n\nhydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. \n\n\n[00192] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed \n\n in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered.

Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00195] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an \n\n aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n [00196] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00197] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00198] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MA OGEM™ EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the \n\n remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n[00199] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00200] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n [00201] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,1 19. Such hydrophobic but water- vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n [00202] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post- coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00203] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n\n [00204] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00205] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, \n\n\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J.

Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller- compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n\n [00209] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00223] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g., March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton ^H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash chromatography (Still et al. (1978) J. Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n\n [00224] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00225] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., /-butyldimethylsilyl, /-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include /-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the \n\n like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), p-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00226] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley -Interscience. \n\n\n[00227] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00228] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00229] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00230] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J. Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n\n \n\n [00231] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00232] As illustrated in Scheme 1 , an appropriate substituted aminoheteroaryl- carboxamide 1 may be treated with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent (for example diphosgene, triphosgene, carbonyl diimidazole) to form the 2,4-dihydroxy heteroarylpyrimidine 2, which is then treated with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form the 2,4-dihalo derivative 3 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example, sulfonate, which can be prepared by treatment of 2 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA). As a further alternative, 2 may also be transformed into 3 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)2-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. When 3 is treated with an azolyl amine in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA), optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, preferential displacement of X at the pyrimidyl 4-position occurs to afford 4. Then 4 is treated with an appropriate thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent, to form 5. The pyrimidyl 2-sulfide moiety of 5 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 6. Sulfone 7 is formed either from further oxidation of 6 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 5 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00233] As illustrated in Scheme 2, an appropriate substituted \n\n\nammoheteroarylcarboxylic ester 8 may be treated with benzoyl isothiocyanate at 0 °C to rt, in a suitable solvent such as acetone, DCM, THF, DMF, or DMA to afford 9. Intermediate 9 is first treated with a base such as sodium ieri-butoxide, in a solvent such as MeOH or EtOH, at rt or with heating as necessary, and then acidified with an acid such as aq HCl, to afford 10. Treatment of 10 with an aryl or heteroaryl iodide or an aryl or heteroaryl bromide, in the presence of an inorganic base such as cesium carbonate, and in the presence of suitably activated copper (0) powder, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA, and at an elevated temperature (heating between 100 to 250 °C, in a conventional oil bath or in a microwave synthesizer), affords 11. Compound 11 is treated with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form the 4-halo derivative 12 (X = halo). \n\n\nAlternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example, sulfonate which can be prepared via treatment of 11 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA). As a further alternative, 11 may also be transformed into 12 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. \n\n\nTreatment of 12 with an azolyl amine in the presence of an organic base (such as \n\n DIEA or TEA), optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, affords 5. The pyrimidyl 2-sulfide moiety of 5 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 6. Sulfone 7 is formed either from further oxidation of 6 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 5 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a \n\n\npercarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. \n\n\nSche \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00234] Scheme 3 illustrates synthetic methods for the preparation of substituted pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives 21 and 22 and associated intermediates. Compound 13 (which may be prepared as described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2007 15(19), 6336-6352) is treated with sodium acetate in water at elevated temperature, followed by treatment with chloroacetaldehyde in water at elevated temperature, to afford 14. The sulfide moiety of 14 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight \n\n excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 15. \n\n\nSulfone 16 is formed either from further oxidation of 15 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 14 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. Compounds 15 or 16 may be treated with an appropriate thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent, to afford 17. Compound 17 is treated with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form the 4-halo derivative 18 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example, sulfonate which can be prepared via treatment of 17 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA). The incorporation of a substituent at N-7 of pyrrolopyrimidine derivative 18 may be achieved via the treatment of 18 first with a base such as sodium hydride or sodium or potassium tert- butoxide at 0 °C to rt in a suitable solvent such as THF, DMF or DMA, followed by treatment with an appropriate electrophilic reagent, such as (but not restricted to) an alkyl, cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl bromide, chloride, iodide, or sulfonate derivative optionally in the presence of a source of iodide ion, such as potassium iodide, at rt or elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion, to afford 19. Treatment of 19 with an azolyl amine in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA), optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, affords 20. The sulfide moiety of 20 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 21. \n\n\nSulfone 22 is formed either from further oxidation of 21 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 20 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. \n\n Scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 22 \n\n\nScheme 4 illustrates synthetic methods for the preparation of substituted pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives 27 and 28 and associated intermediates. When compound 23 (when X\n1\n = CI, this may be prepared as described in \n\n\nWO2008/39359 A2; when X\n1\n = SMe, this is available from commercial sources, alternatively it may be prepared as described in WO2007/147109 A2) is treated with an azolyl amine in the presence of an organic base such as DIEA or TEA, optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, \n\n preferential displacement of CI at the pyrimidyl 4-position occurs to afford 24. \n\n\nTreatment of compound 24 with an appropriate mono-substituted hydrazine derivative 24a in the presence of an organic base such as DIEA or TEA in a suitable solvent such as dioxane, THF, DMF or DMA, at rt to an elevated temperature as necessary, affords pyrazolopyrimidine 25. Compound 25 (when X\n1\n = CI) may be directly converted to the pyrimidyl 2-sulfonyl derivative 28 by treatment with an appropriate substituted sulfinate salt 25a, in a suitable solvent such as DMSO, DMF or DMA, at an elevated temperature, for example, heating between 100 to 250 °C in a \n\n\nconventional oil bath or in a microwave synthesizer. Alternatively, compound 25 (when X\n1\n = SMe) may be converted to the pyrimidyl 2-sulfonyl derivative 28 by initial treatment with an excess quantity of a suitable oxidizing agent such as meta- chloroperbenzoic acid in a suitable solvent such as DCM, followed by treatment with an appropriate substituted sulfmate salt 25a, in a suitable solvent such as DMSO, DMF or DMA, at an elevated temperature, for example, heating between 100 to 250 °C in a conventional oil bath or in a microwave synthesizer. Alternatively, compound 25 (when X\n1\n = CI) may be treated with an appropriate thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent to afford 26. Alternatively, compound 25 (when X\n1\n = SMe) may be initially treated with an excess of an appropriate oxidizing agent such as meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, followed by treatment with a thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent to afford 26. The sulfide moiety of compound 26 may be oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 27. Sulfone 28 can also be formed either from further oxidation of 27 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 26 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. \n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00235] Scheme 5 illustrates synthetic methods for the preparation of substituted pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives 37 and 38, and associated intermediates. Treatment of p ra-methoxybenzaldehyde 29 with an appropriate mono-substituted hydrazine derivative 24a in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, 2-propanol, or toluene at rt to an elevated temperature as necessary, and optionally in the presence of a water scavenger such as molecular sieves or anhydrous magnesium sulfate, or with removal of water via azeotropic distillation, affords a hydrazone derivative 30. Treatment of 30 with malononitrile and triethyl orthoformate in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH or 2-propanol, at rt to elevated temperature as required, followed by treatment with an acid such as aq HC1 at rt to elevated temperature as necessary, affords substituted 5-amino-pyrazolopyrimidine-4-carbonitrile derivatives 31. Compounds 31 are converted to carboxamides 32 by standard methods, for example by treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid at 0 °C to rt or by reaction with potassium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide in water at 0 °C to rt. A compound 32 is treated with phosgene \n\n or a phsogene equivalent such as diphosgene, triphosgene, carbonyl diimidazole to form the 2,4-dihydroxy heteroarylpyrimidine 33, which is then treated with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form the 2,4-dihalo derivative 34 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example, sulfonate, which can be prepared via treatment of 33 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA). As a further alternative, 33 may also be transformed into 34 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)2-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. When 34 is treated with an azolyl amine in the presence of an organic base such as DIEA or TEA, optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, preferential displacement of X at the pyrimidyl 4-position occurs to afford 35. Subsequent treatment of 35 with an appropriate thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent, affords 36. The sulfide moiety of 36 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 37. Sulfone 38 is formed either from further oxidation of 37 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 36 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. \n\n\n\n\nSc \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 38 \n\n\n [00236] Scheme 6 illustrates synthetic methods for the preparation of substituted thiazoloyrimidine derivatives 47 and 48, and associated intermediates. The treatment of 4-amino-thiazolopyrimidine-5-carbonitrile derivative 39, which may be prepared as described in Tetrahedron 2008, 64(39), 9309-9314, with either concentrated sulfuric acid at 0 °C to rt, or by reaction with potassium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide in water at 0 °C to rt, affords 4-amino-thiazolopyrimidine-5-carboxamide derivative 40. The thiazole 2-sulfide moiety of 40 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 41. Subsequent reaction of 41 with appropriate nucleophiles, such as (but not restricted to) primary and secondary amines, alkoxides, alkylamgnesium halides, or metal cyanides, in appropriate solvents and at appropriate temperatures, will afford, respectively, 2-amino, 2-alkoxy, 2-alkyl, and 2-cyanothiazolopyrimidine derivatives as encompassed by structure 42. Thiazole derivative 42 is treated with \n\n phosgene or a phosgene equivalent such as diphosgene, triphosgene, or carbonyl diimidazole to form the 2,4-dihydroxy heteroarylpyrimidine 43, which is then treated with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form the 2,4-dihalo derivative 44 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example, sulfonate which can be prepared via treatment of 43 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of an organic base (such as DIEA or TEA). As a further alternative, 43 may also be transformed into 44 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)2-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. When 44 is treated with an azolyl amine in the presence of an organic base such as DIEA or TEA, optionally in the presence of an iodide source such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, preferential displacement of X at the pyrimidyl 4-position occurs to afford 45. Subsequent treatment of 45 with an appropriate thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent, affords 46. The pyrimidyl 2-sulfide moiety of 46 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 47. Sulfone 48 is formed either from further oxidation of 47 using additional equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 46 by treatment with two to four equivalents of an oxidant, such as a percarboxylic acid, at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00237] As illustrated in Scheme 7, an appropriate aminoheteroaryl-carboxamide 1, 32, or 42 may be transformed to a 2-carboxylate substituted heteroarylpyrimidine 49 with an activated oxalic acid derivative such as a dialkyl oxalate either neat or in a suitable solvent such as EtOH or HO Ac with heating as required. Alternatively, 1, 32 or 42 is treated with an oxalic acid monoalkyl ester chloride in a suitable solvent such as DCM in the presence of a base such as TEA and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as DMAP; or 1, 32, or 42 is treated with a cyano oxoacetate monoalkyl ester with heating in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF in the presence of a base such as TEA. Subsequent treatment under dehydrating conditions, for example, heating with or without TMSC1 in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA in a suitable solvent such as DCE affords the bicyclic product 49. Treatment of 49 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 50. Alternatively, 49 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide to form 50 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 49 may \n\n also be transformed into 50 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)2-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. \n\n\nTreatment of 50 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, and at appropriate temperatures, produces ketone 51. Subsequent conversion of 51 to 52 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 2 for conversion of 12 to 5. \n\n\nSc \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00238] As illustrated in Scheme 8, compounds 1, 32, or 42 may be condensed with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 53 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example with heat or with TMSC1 in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxy derivatives 54. Alternatively, heating of 1, 32, or 42 with a carboxylic acid 53 (Y = OH) or its salt in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 54. Treatment of 54 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 55. Alternatively, 54 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 55 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 54 may also be transformed into 55 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)2-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Subsequent conversion of 55 to 56 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 2 for conversion of 12 to 5. \n\n\nScheme 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00239] Scheme 9 illustrates synthetic methods for the preparation of substituted thiazolopyrimidine derivatives 61 and associated intermediates. Compound 40 may be condensed with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 53 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSC1 in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxy derivatives 57. Alternatively, heating of 40 with a carboxylic acid 53 (Y = OH) or its salt in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 57. Treatment of 57 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms 58 (X = halo). Alternatively, 57 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 58 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 57 may also be transformed into 58 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)2-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. \n\n\nSubsequent conversion of 58 to 59 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 2 for conversion of 12 to 5. The thiazolopyrimidine 2- sulfide moiety of 59 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 60. Subsequent reaction of 60 with appropriate nucleophiles, such as but not restricted to primary and secondary amines, alkoxides, alkylmagnesium halides, or metal cyanides, in appropriate solvents and at appropriate temperatures, affords \n\n\nrespectively, 2-amino, 2-alkoxy, 2-alkyl, and 2-cyanothiazolopyrimidine derivatives as encompassed by structure 61. \n\n Sche \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00240] In Scheme 10 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of fused heteroaryl pyridines 70. Treatment of an appropriate haloheteroaryl carboxylic acid 62 with acetoacetate ester and subsequent processing under conditions described in the literature (see Bender and Sarantakis, Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1986, 18, 286-289 and references therein), 64 is formed. The hydroxyl groups of 64 are converted to leaving groups X in a fashion analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 2 to 3, to form 65. Treatment of 65 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required, affords 66. Treatment of 66 with a suitable thiolate reagent with heating as required forms an intermediate sulfide, which is oxidized to sulfoxides or sulfones 70 in a manner analogous to that described in \n\n Scheme 1 for conversion of 5 to 6 or 7. In some cases it may be advantageous to displace one of the X groups of 65 with a group \"Prot\" followed by reaction with a thiolate reagent to form 67. \"Prot\" is intended to be a group, for example alkoxy or thioalkoxy, which can be subsequently conveniently converted to a leaving group X, for example to afford 68. Conversion of 68 to 69 is effected under conditions analogous to, or if needed, more forcing than, those that used to effect conversion of 65 to 66. Conversion of 69 to 70 is carried out under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for the conversion of 5 to 6 or 7. \n\n\nScheme 10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 67 68 69 \n\n\n [00241] In Scheme 11 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of fused heteroaryl pyridines 75. A suitable haloheteroaryl carboxylic ester 71 is treated with 2-acetamidoacrylate ester in the presence of a Pd catalyst, for example palladium acetate, with heating in a suitable solvent such as DMF to form 72. The hydroxyl group of 72 is converted to a leaving group X to form 73 in a fashion analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 2 to 3. Treatment of 73 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, and at appropriate temperatures, produces ketone 74. Treatment of 74 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required, affords 75. \n\n Sche \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00242] In Scheme 12 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of fused heteroaryl pyridines 80. A suitable methylheteroaryl carbonitrile 76 is deprotonated with strong base, and then treated with a suitably activated carboxylic acid 53, wherein Y may be alkoxy or -N(Me)OMe, to form ketone 77. Treatment of 77 with concentrated sulfuric acid and water effects ring closure to the fused hydroxypyridine derivative 78. The hydroxyl group of 78 is converted to a leaving group X to form 79 in a fashion analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 2 to 3.

As described by Barker, et al. (J. Chem. Res. 1985, 5, 214-215), treatment of a suitable aminoheteroaryl carboxylic ester 81 with a dialkyl \n\n malonate such as 81a affords amide 82. Alternatively, as described in \n\n\nWO2006/61642, treatment of 81 with an alkyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as DIEA or TEA affords 82. Treatment of 82 with a base such as sodium hydride or an alkoxide with heating effects ring closure, which is followed by ester hydrolysis and decarboxylation to afford 83. Conversion of 83 to 85 via 84 is effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 10 for conversion of 64 to 70. \n\n\nScheme 13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00244] In Scheme 14 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of fused heteroaryl pyridines 90. As described in US5026700, treatment of a suitable aminoheteroarene 86 with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate in refluxing alcohol solvent affords fused hydroxypyridine 87. Alternatively, dialkyl 2-oxosuccinate may be substituted for dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate. Conversion of 87 to 90 via 88 and 89 may be effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 11 for converting 72 to 75. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00245] In Scheme 15 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of fused heteroaryl pyridines 94. A suitable aminoheteroarene 86 is acetylated under Friedel-Crafts conditions and then the amino group is acylated with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 53 to afford amide 91. Ring closure to 92 is effected by treatment with a base such as hydroxide or alkoxide with heating as required. Conversion of 92 to 94 via 93 is effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 12 for conversion of 78 to 80. \n\n\nScheme 15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 93 \n\n\n [00246] In Scheme 16 are illustrated representative examples by which the keto group in any of 52 (Scheme 7), 75 (Scheme 11), or 90 (Scheme 14) can be further modified to afford additional compounds of the invention. Treatment of ketone 52, 75, or 90 with Lawesson's reagent affords thioketones 95. Treatment of ketone 52, 75, or 90 with an amine, hydroxylamine, or alkoxylamine under dehydrating conditions optionally in the presence of acid with heating affords, respectively, imines, oximes, or O-alkyl oximes 96. Treatment of ketone 52, 75, or 90 with a Wittig reagent or \n\n Homer-Emmons reagent affords olefins 97. Treatment of ketone 52, 75, or 90 with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride affords secondary alcohols 98. Treatment of ketone 52, 75, or 90 with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound affords tertiary alcohols 99. \n\n\nHeating ketone 52, 75, or 90 with an alcohol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords ketals 100. Heating ketone 52, 75, or 90 with a 1,2- 1,3- or 1,4-diol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords cyclic ketals 101. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 16 (continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00247] In Scheme 17 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 53 used in Schemes 8, 9, and 15. A carboxylic acid derivative 102, where Y' is for example alkoxy or a subsequently removable chiral auxiliary, is deprotonated at the alpha position with a strong base and treated with an alkylating agent to afford 103. The sequence is repeated with the same or a different alkylating agent to form 104. The Y' group of 104 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 53 that is suitable for use in Scheme 8, 9, or 15. \n\n\nScheme 17 \n\n\n\n\n\n 102 103 104 \n\n\n ► 53 \n\n\n [00248] In Scheme 18 is illustrated an alternative method for preparing acids 53 used in Schemes 8, 9, and 15. A suitable carboxylic acid derivative, following conversion with base to an enolate 105 or its equivalent is treated with an aryl halide, or more suitably with a heteroaryl halide to form 104. The Y' group of 104 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 53 that is suitable for use in Scheme 8, 9, or 15. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 105 106 104 \n\n\n [00249] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that standard functional group manipulations may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention from products or intermediates prepared as described by the foregoing methods. In Schemes 19 through 23 are shown representative examples that are intended to illustrate, but in no way to limit the scope of, such standard functional group manipulations. \n\n\n [00250] For example, as described in Scheme 19, imine 96 can be treated with a suitable reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH or THF, at 0 °C to rt or further elevated temperatures as required, to afford amine 107. Olefin 97 can be treated with hydrogen gas in the presence of a noble metal catalyst and in a solvent such as water, a lower alcohol, EtOAc, or DMF or mixtures thereof, at rt or elevated temperatures, to afford 108. Alcohol 98 can be treated with thionyl chloride, or carbon tetrabromide in the presence of \n\n\ntriphenylphosphine, and in a suitable solvent such as THF or DCM, at rt to elevated temperatures, to afford, respectively, alkyl chlorides (X = CI) or bromides 109 (X = Br). Or alcohol 98 can be treated with a fluorinating reagent such as \n\n\ndiethylaminosulfur trifluoride, in a suitable solvent such as DCM, at 0 °C to rt, to afford alkyl fluorides 109 (X = F). Compound 110 can be treated with either boron tribromide in a suitable solvent such as DCM, at 0 °C to rt or elevated temperatures as required, or treated with trimethylsilyl iodide in a suitable solvent such as DCM, at 0 °C to rt or elevated temperatures as required to afford 111. Compound 107 can be treated with a suitable aryl or heteroaryl bromide or iodide, in the presence of a Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands, in the presence of an inorganic or organic base, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF, THF, or dioxane, and at rt or elevated temperatures as required, to afford 112 (where R\n13\n is aryl or heteroaryl). Alternatively, compound 107 can be treated with an appropriate substituted acid chloride, or an appropriate substituted chloroformate, in a suitable solvent such as DCM, THF, or DMF, at 0 °C \n\n to rt to elevated temperature as required, to afford 112, where R is C(0)R\nv\n or is C(0)OR\nw\n, respectively. \n\n\nScheme 19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n heteroaryl, C(0)R\nv\n' C(0)OR\nw\n, etc. \n\n\n 112 \n\n [00251] In addition to the above, for example as described in Scheme 20, compound 113 can be treated with thionyl chloride or carbon tetrabromide in the presence of triphenylphosphine, and in a suitable solvent such as THF or DCM, at rt to elevated temperatures, to afford, respectively, alkyl chlorides or bromides 114. Compound 114 can be subsequently treated with either an appropriate substituted primary or secondary amine, or with a suitable alkoxide, in a suitable solvent such as THF, DCM or DMF, at 0 °C to rt to elevated temperatures as required, to afford, compound 116 or 117, respectively. Alternatively, compound 116 can be prepared from 113 via 115, wherein 113 is treated with a suitable oxidizing agent such as Dess- Martin periodinane, or a mixture of oxalyl chloride and DMSO (Swern oxidizing conditions), in a suitable solvent such as DCM, and at appropriate temperatures, to afford 115. Compound 115 can be treated with an appropriate substituted primary or secondary amine and a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, optionally in the presence of HOAc, and in a suitable solvent such as THF, DCM, MeOH or DMF, at 0 °C to rt to elevated temperatures as required, to afford 116. \n\n\nScheme 20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00252] In addition to the above, for example as described in Scheme 21, compounds 121 and 122 can be prepared using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 20 for conversion of 113 toll6 and 117. \n\n Scheme 21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00253] In addition to the above, for example as described in Scheme 22, compounds 126 and 127 can be prepared using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 20 for conversion of 113 toll6 and 117. \n\n\nScheme 22 \n\n\n\n\n\n \nR5\n~\nN\n 2 \nR5\n^ \n\n\n[00254] In addition to the above, for example as described in Scheme 23, compound 128 can be treated with lithium hydroxide in aq THF to afford 129. The conversion of the carboxylic acid group of 129 to the carboxamide group of 130 can be accomplished by a variety of standard methods, including treatment with an appropriate substituted primary or secondary amine in the presence of coupling reagents such as HATU, EDCI and HOBt, DCC and the like, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA, or alternatively via the acid chloride by treatment of the acid \n\n with thionyl chloride or phosphoryl chloride or the like, followed by the addition of an appropriate substituted primary or secondary amine in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine, TEA or DIEA. Compounds 133 and 136 can be prepared from 131 or 134, respectively, using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 23 for conversion of 128 tol30. \n\n\nScheme 23 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Aminoazole or azolyl amine intermediates employed herein may be obtained either via commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Scheme 24 illustrates representative methods that may be employed for the preparation of additional aminoazoles or azolyl amines. For example, nitroazoles 137 may be converted to aminoazoles 138 via treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n in a suitable solvent such as DCE or EtOH optionally in the presence of HCl, with heating. Alternatively, treatment of 137 with activated iron or zinc metal in HOAc with heating will afford 138. Alternatively, treatment of 137 with palladium metal on activated carbon in the presence of > 1 atmosphere pressure of hydrogen gas, in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or EtOAc or mixtures of these, at rt or with heating as required, will afford 138. Alternatively, treatment of 137 with sodium hydrosulfite in a suitable solvent mixture such as THF and water at rt or with heating \n\n as required, will afford 138. Alternatively, aminoazoles 138 may also be obtained from azole carboxylic acids 139 via initial treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, followed by hydrolysis. Alternatively, treatment of 139 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in the presence of excess ieri-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, will afford a ieri-butylcarbamoyl azole intermediate, which upon treatment with an acid such as TFA or HC1, and in a suitable solvent, will afford 138. Aminoazoles 138 may also be obtained from azolyl bromides or iodides 140, bearing (as required) suitable protecting groups on any azole ring N-H positions, via initial treatment with a suitable amino containing reagent (where P = protecting group), such as \n\n\nbenzophenone imine, 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, or ieri-butyl carbamate, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable organopalladium-complex, and optionally in the presence of a suitable phosphine-ligand, and optionally in the presence of a suitable base, and in a suitable solvent with heating or under microwave conditions as required, to afford intermediate 141. Subsequent N-deprotection of intermediate 141 (including azole ring N-deprotection, where required), employing appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art will afford 138. Conversion of aminoazoles 138 to alkylated aminoazoles 142 may be achieved via treatment of 138 with an appropriate aldehyde or ketone substrate, in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as TMSC1 or TiCl\n4\n and a reducing agent such as sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, THF, or MeOH, optionally in the presence of HOAc, at rt or with heating as required. \n\n\nAlternatively, 142 may be obtained via treatment of 138 with an alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable organic base such as pyridine or DIEA, and sodium or potassium iodide, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF or THF, at rt or with heating as required. Nitroazoles 137, azole carboxylic acids 139, and azole bromides or iodides 140 may be obtained from commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\nScheme 24 \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n 137 138 \n\n\n \n\n ^gg \n\n\n P = protecting group \n\n\n\n\n\n 138 142 \n\n\n [00255] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for\n\n\n30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween\n\n\n20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\n Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20,\n\n\n6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- well plates in a final volume of 34 xL, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 xL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S 10, for example, may be calculated for \n\n each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386. \n\n\n[00384] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2.

Description\n\n\n\n\n 7-CYCLYLQUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF USE \n\n\n THEREOF\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional\n\n\nApplication No. 61/379,334, filed September 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n FIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The \n\n\ncompounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679).\n\n\nThe family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to \n\n phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n\nphosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. Exemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of- function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 76», 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

EMBO 2002 21(9), 2159-2167. \n\n\n [0007] Literature indicates that JAK may also serve as a target for prostate cancer, including androgen-resistant prostate cancer. See, Barton et al. Mol. Cane. Ther. 2004 3(1), 11-20, Blume- Jensen et al. Nature (2001) 411(6835):355-356 and Bromberg J Clin Invest. (2002) 109(9): 1139-1142, and Rane Oncogene (2000) 19(49):5662-5679. JAK as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a \n\n therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. See, Borie et ah, Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et ah, Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14): l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TGI 01209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et ah \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21 : 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibtors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.

Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, Metabolism, 43: 487 (1994); \n\n\nGately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); and Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00127] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00128] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n [00129] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n C.

Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; \n\n\n5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; \n\n\n5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; \n\n\n6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; and 6,699,500. \n\n\n1. Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00182] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those \n\n skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999). \n\n\n [00183] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n[00184] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), \n\n\nhydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. \n\n\n[00185] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device included, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polymethylmethacrylate, \n\n polybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate- methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, \n\n\nethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and \n\n\nethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, \n\n\npolydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, and ; hydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides. \n\n\n [00186] In a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions. \n\n\n[00187] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, melt-granulation followed by compression. \n\n\n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00188] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n [00189] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00190] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffmose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00191] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MA NOGEM\n™\n EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the \n\n remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n[00192] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00193] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n [00194] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, \n\n polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00195] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post- coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00196] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n\n [00197] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00198] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, \n\n\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). \n\n\n[00199] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. See, U.S. Pat. No. \n\n\n5,612,059 and WO 2002/17918. The AMT controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, and a dip- coating method. \n\n\n [00200] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as ESC controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an osmotic \n\n membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s), a hydroxylethyl cellulose, and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n3. Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n [00201] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μιη to about 3 mm, about 50 μιη to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μιη to about 1 mm in diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller- compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n\n [00202] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4. Targeted Delivery \n\n\n [00203] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated, including liposome-, resealed erythrocyte-, and antibody-based delivery systems.

Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, see, Fabian et al, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23,329-336, radioactivity incorporation assays, as well as a variety of cell based assays. \n\n\n [00205] Exemplary cell based assay methodologies include measurement of\n\n\nSTAT5A phosphorylation, for example, by ELISA or the measurement of proliferation in leukemic cell lines such as TF-1 or HEL-2, for example, by BrdU incorporation, by fluorescent staining or by a reporter assay activated by the transcription factor STAT5. Cells useful in the assays include cells with wildtype\n\n\nJAK such as TF-1 or mutated JAK such as the cell line HEL-2 which express a constitutively active JAK2 carrying the V617F mutation.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00216] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g. , March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton ^H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass \n\n spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash \n\n\nchromatography (Still et al. (1978) J Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n\n [00217] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00218] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl {e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00219] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00220] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, \n\n the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00221] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00222] Compounds of formula I may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00223] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00224] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00225] As illustrated in Scheme 1, an appropriate halo-substituted anthranilamide 1 can be treated with a suitable boronic acid, boronate ester, aryl/vinyl/heteroaryl trialkyltin reagent, or other suitable coupling partner in a palladium mediated cross- coupling reaction to form the substituted anthranilimide 2 (R\n6\n = aryl, heterocyclyl, \n\n heteroaryl). Alternatively 1 can be treated with suitable amide, amine, sulfonamide, or other suitable coupling partner for a palladium mediated Buchwald type coupling reaction to form an N-substituted anthranilamide 2 (R\n6\n = -NR\n19\nR\n20\n). Substituted anthranilamide 2 can then be transformed into quinazoline 5 by treatment a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 3 to form amide 4 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSC1 in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxy derivatives 5. Alternatively, heating of 2 with a carboxylic acid (3, Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 5. Treatment of 5 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 6. Alternatively, 5 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 6 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 5 may also be transformed into 6 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Treatment of 6 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 7. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00226] As illustrated in Scheme 2, an appropriate halo-substitued anthranilamide 1 can be transformed into quinazoline 9 by treatment a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 3 to form amide 8 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSC1 in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIE A, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxy derivatives 9. Alternatively, heating of 1 with a carboxylic acid (3, Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 9. Treatment of 9 with Lawesson's reagent, P2S5, or other deoxosulfurization reagent, followed by alkylation forms thioether 10. Thioether 10 is treated with a suitable boronic acid, boronate ester, aryl/vinyl/heteroaryl trialkyltin reagent, or other suitable coupling partner in a palladium mediated cross-coupling reaction to form the substituted quinazoline 11 (R\n6\n = aryl, heterocycle, heteroaryl). Alternatively, 10 is treated with suitable amide, amine, sulfonamide, or other suitable coupling partner for a palladium mediated Buchwald type coupling reaction to form an N-substituted quinazoline 11 (R\n6\n = -NR\n19\nR\n20\n). When the halogen of 10 is Br or I, metalation of 10 with a suitable alkyl lithium, alkyl magnesium halide, or magnesium in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent forms an \n\n intermediate metalloquinazoline, for example a quinazoline lithium or quinazoline Grignard reagent, which can then be treated with a suitable electrophile to form 11 (R\n6\n = heterocyclyl). Thioether 11 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 12 (X = S(O)-alkyl). Sulfone 12 (X = S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) is formed either from further oxidation of sulfoxide 12 (X = S(O)-alkyl) using additional equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from 11 by treatment with two to four equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. Treatment of 12 (X = S(O)- alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 7. \n\n\nScheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00227] As illustrated in Scheme 3, an appropriate halo-substitued anthranilamide 1 can be transformed to a 2-carboxylate substituted quinazoline 13 with an activated oxalic acid derivative such as a dialkyl oxalate either neat or in a suitable solvent such as EtOH or HO Ac with heating as required. Alternatively, 1 is treated with an oxalic acid monoalkyl ester chloride in a suitable solvent such as DCM in the presence of a base such as TEA and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as DMAP; or 1 is \n\n treated with a cyano oxoacetate monoalkyl ester with heating in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF in the presence of a base such as TEA. Subsequent treatment under dehydrating conditions, for example, heating with or without TMSCl in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA in a suitable solvent such as DCE affords the quinazoline 13. Treatment of 13 with Lawesson's reagent, P2S5, or other deoxosulfurization reagent, followed by alkylation forms thioether 14. Treatment of 14 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, produces ketone 15. Subsequent conversion of 15 to 16 (R\n6\n = aryl, heterocycle, heteroaryl, -NR\n19\nR\n20\n ) is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 2 for conversion of 10 to 11. If required, ketone 15 may be protected as a cyclic ketal 17. When the halogen of 17 is Br or I, metalation of 17 with a suitable alkyl lithium, alkyl magnesium halide, or magnesium in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent forms an intermediate metalloquinazoline, for example a quinazoline lithium or quinazoline Grignard reagent, which can then be treated with a suitable electrophile to form 18 (R\n6\n = heterocyclyl). Hydrolysis of acetal 18 gives ketone 16. Subsequent conversion of 16 to 19 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 2 for conversion of 12 to 7. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00228] In Scheme 4 are illustrated representative methods by which the keto group in 19 (Scheme 3) can be further modified to afford additional compounds of the invention. Treatment of 19 with Lawesson's reagent affords thioketones 20. \n\n\nTreatment of 19 with an amine, hydroxylamine, or alkoxylamine under dehydrating conditions optionally in the presence of acid with heating affords, respectively, imines, oximes, or O-alkyl oximes 21. Treatment of 19 with a Wittig reagent or Horner-Emmons reagent affords olefins 22. Treatment of 19 with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride affords secondary alcohols 23. Treatment of 19 with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound affords tertiary alcohols 24. Heating 19 with an alcohol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords ketals 25. Heating 19 with a 1,2- 1,3- or 1,4-diol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords cyclic ketals 26. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00229] In Scheme 5 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 3 used in Schemes 1 and 2. A carboxylic acid derivative 27, where Y' is for example alkoxy or a subsequently removable chiral auxiliary, is deprotonated and treated with an alkylating agent to afford 28. The sequence is repeated with the same or a different alkylating agent to form 29. The Y' group of 29 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 3 that is suitable for use in Scheme 1 or 2. \n\n\nScheme 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ► 3 \n\n\n [00230] In Scheme 6 is illustrated an alternative method for preparing acids 3 used in Schemes 1 and 2. A suitable carboxylic acid derivative, following conversion with a base, a transition metal, or a transition metal salt to an enolate 30 or its equivalent is treated with an aryl halide 31, possibly with the use of a palladium source and a suitable phosphine catalyst, to form 32. The Y' group of 32 is then converted by \n\n procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 3 that is suitable for use in Scheme 1 and 2. \n\n\nScheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n 30 31 32 \n\n\n [00231] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that standard functional group manipulations may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention from products or intermediates prepared as described by the foregoing methods. In Scheme 7 are shown representative examples that are intended to illustrate, but in no way to limit the scope of, such standard functional group manipulations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 7 (continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00232] Scheme 8 illustrates methods that may be employed for the preparation of amino-methyl substituted quinazoline derivatives 49. As illustrated in Scheme 8, methyl carboxylate-substituted anthranilamides 43 (prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art) can be transformed into 4-hydroxyquinazoline derivatives 45 by treatment with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 3 to form \n\n\nintermediate amide 44 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSCl in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 45. Alternatively, heating of 43 with a carboxylic acid (3, Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 45 directly. Treatment of 45 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-haloquinazoline derivative 46. \n\n\nAlternatively, 45 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 46 (where X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 45 may also be transformed into \n\n 46 (where X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Treatment of 46 with an aminoazole in the presence of a base such as DIEA and optionally in the presence of Nal or KI, in a suitable organic solvent and with heating as required, affords 47. Alternatively, treatment of 46 with an aminoazole in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required, and optionally in the presence of a base, and in a suitable organic solvent with heating as required affords 47. Conversion of 47 to 48 may be achieved via treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride, in a suitable solvent such as THF, at 0 °C to rt, or with heating as required. Conversion of 48 to the aminomethyl derivative 49 may be achieved via initial treatment with a suitable oxidizing reagent such as Dess-Martin Periodinane in a suitable solvent such as DCM or DMA at 0 °C to rt, or Mn0\n2\n in a suitable solvent such as THF or DCM at rt or with heating as required, to afford the aldehyde intermediate, followed by treatment with an amine (R\n19a\nR\n20b\nNH) in the presence of a suitable reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium \n\n\ncyanoborohydride and in a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, or MeOH, optionally in the presence of HO Ac, at rt or with heating as required. \n\n\n[00233] Scheme 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00234] Aminoazole or azolyl amine intermediates employed herein may be obtained either via commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Scheme 9 illustrates representative methods that may be employed for the preparation of additional aminoazoles or azolyl amines. For example, nitroazoles 50 may be converted to aminoazoles 51 via treatment with a suitable \n\n reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n in a suitable solvent such as DCE or EtOH optionally in the presence of HC1, with heating. Alternatively, treatment of 50 with activated iron or zinc metal in HO Ac with heating, will afford 51. Alternatively, treatment of 50 with palladium metal on activated carbon in the presence of > 1 atmosphere pressure of hydrogen gas, in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or EtOAc or mixtures of these, at rt or with heating as required, will afford 51. Alternatively treatment of 50 with sodium hydrosulfite in a suitable solvent mixture such as THF and water at rt or with heating as required, will afford 51. Alternatively, aminoazoles 51 may also be obtained from azole carboxylic acids 52 via initial treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, followed by hydrolysis. Alternatively, treatment of 52 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in the presence of excess tert-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, will afford a tert-butylcarbamoyl azole intermediate, which upon treatment with an acid such as TFA or HC1 in a suitable solvent, will afford 51. \n\n\nAminoazoles 51 may also be obtained from azolyl bromides or iodides 53, bearing (as required) suitable protecting groups on any azole ring N-H position, via initial treatment with a suitable amino containing reagent (where P = protecting group), such as benzophenone imine, 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, or tert-butyl carbamate, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable organopalladium-complex, and optionally in the presence of a suitable phosphine-ligand, and optionally in the presence of a suitable base, and in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature or under microwave conditions, to afford intermediate 54. Subsequent N-deprotection of intermediate 54 (including azole ring N-deprotection, where required), employing appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art will afford 51. Conversion of aminoazoles 51 to alkylated aminoazoles 55 may be achieved via treatment of 51 with an appropriate aldehyde or ketone substrate, in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as TMSCl or TiCl\n4\n and a reducing agent such as sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, THF, or MeOH, optionally in the presence of HO Ac, at rt or with heating as required. \n\n Alternatively, 55 may be obtained via treatment of 51 with an alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable organic base such as pyridine or DIEA, and sodium or potassium iodide, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF or THF, at rt or with heating as required. Nitroazoles 50, azole carboxylic acids 52, and azole bromides or iodides 53 may be obtained from commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n[00235] Scheme 9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n 53 51 \n\n\n P = protecting group \n\n\n\n\n\n 51 55 \n\n\n [00236] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage {See, Fabian et al or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween \n\n 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\nBinding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- well plates in a final volume of 34 μί, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 μί. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S10, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386 kinases. \n\n\n[00262] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2.

Description\n\n\n\n\n THIENOPYRIDINE AND THIENOPYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional\n\n\nApplication No. 61/379,301, filed September 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n FIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The \n\n\ncompounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679).\n\n\nThe family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n phosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. Exemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of-function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 70, 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

EMBO 2002 21(9), 2159-2167. \n\n\n [0007] Literature indicates that JAK may also serve as a target for prostate cancer, including androgen-resistant prostate cancer. See, Barton et al. Mol. Cane. Ther. 2004 3(1), 1 1-20, Blume- Jensen et al. Nature (2001) 41 1(6835):355-356 and Bromberg J Clin Invest. (2002) 109(9): 1 139-1142, Rane Oncogene (2000) 19(49):5662-5679. JAK as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. See, Borie et al., \n\n Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et al, Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14): l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TG101209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et al. \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21 : 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibtors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.

I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n [00120] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00121] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [00122] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n C.

Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; \n\n\n5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; \n\n\n5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; \n\n\n6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; and 6,699,500. \n\n\n1. Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00175] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those \n\n skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999). \n\n\n [00176] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n[00177] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), \n\n\nhydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. \n\n\n[00178] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device included, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polymethylmethacrylate, \n\n\npolybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate- \n\n methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and \n\n\nethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, \n\n\npolydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, and ; hydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate,; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides. \n\n\n [00179] In a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions. \n\n\n[00180] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, melt-granulation followed by compression. \n\n\n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00181] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n [00182] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic \n\n agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00183] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffmose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol,; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00184] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MA NOGEM\n™\n EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n [00185] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00186] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n [00187] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00188] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post- coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the \n\n membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00189] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n\n [00190] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00191] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, \n\n\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). \n\n\n[00192] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. See, U.S. Pat. No. \n\n\n5,612,059 and WO 2002/17918.

Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n [00194] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μιη to about 3 mm, about 50 μιη to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μιη to about 1 mm in \n\n diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller- compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n\n [00195] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4. Targeted Delivery \n\n\n[00196] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated, including liposome-, resealed erythrocyte-, and antibody-based delivery systems.

All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash \n\n\nchromatography (Still et al. (1978) J Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n [00210] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00211] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00212] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00213] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00214] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00215] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00216] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n\nDCM dichloromethane \n\n DIEA diisopropylethylamine \n\n\n EDCI N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide \n\n\n hydrochloride \n\n\n EtOAc ethyl acetate \n\n\n EtOH ethanol \n\n\n FBS fetal bovine serum \n\n\n HATU 0-(7- Azabenzotriazol- 1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'- tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate \n\n\n HOAc acetic acid \n\n\n HOBt N-hydroxybenzotriazole \n\n\n MeOH methanol \n\n\n TEA Triethylamine \n\n\n Trityl Triphenylmethyl \n\n\n[00217] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00218] As illustrated in Scheme 1, an appropriate aminothiophene-carboxamide 1 can be treated with phosgene or and equivalent (for example diphosgene, triphosgene, carbonyl diimidazole) to form the 2,4-dihydroxythienopyrimidine 2, which is then treated with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form the 2,4-dihalo derivative 3 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example sulfonate, via treatment of 2 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of base such as a tertiary amine. As a further alternative, 2 may also be transformed into 3 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent, or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. When 3 is treated with an azolyl amine in the presence of tertiary amine base in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMA with heating as necessary, preferential displacement of X at the 4-position occurs to afford 4. Then 4 is treated with an appropriate thioalkoxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMA, or an alcoholic solvent to form 5. The sulfide of 5 is then oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 6. Sulfone 7 is formed either from further oxidation of 6 using additional equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required, or \n\n can be formed directly from 5 by treatment with two to four equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. Scheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00219] As illustrated in Scheme 2, an appropriate aminothiophene-carboxamide 1 can be transformed to a 2-carboxylate substituted thienopyrimidine 8 by treatment with an activated oxalic acid derivative such as a dialkyl oxalate either neat or in a suitable solvent such as EtOH or HO Ac with heating as required. Alternatively, 1 is treated with an oxalic acid monoalkyl ester chloride in a suitable solvent such as DCM in the presence of a base such as TEA and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as DMAP; or 1 is treated with a cyano oxoacetate monoalkyl ester with heating in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF in the presence of a base such as TEA. Subsequent treatment under dehydrating conditions, for example, heating with or without TMSC1 in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA in a suitable solvent such as DCE affords the bicyclic product 8. Treatment of 8 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 9. Alternatively, 8 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide to form 9 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 8 may also be transformed into 9 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's \n\n reagent, or P2S5, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Treatment of 9 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, produces ketone 10. Subsequent conversion of 10 to 11 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 3 to 4. \n\n\nScheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00220] As illustrated in Scheme 3, compounds 1 may be condensed with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 12 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSCl in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxy derivatives 13. Alternatively, heating of 1 with a carboxylic acid (12, Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 13. Treatment of 13 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 14. Alternatively, 13 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 14 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 13 may also be transformed into 14 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with \n\n\nLawesson's reagent, or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. \n\n\n.Subsequent conversion of 14 to 15 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 3 to 4. \n\n Scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15 \n\n\n [00221] In Scheme 4 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of thienopyridines 21. Treatment of an appropriate halothiophene carboxylic acid 16 with acetoacetate ester and subsequent processing under conditions described in the literature (see Bender and Sarantakis, Org Prep Proc Int 1986, 18, 286-289 and references therein), 18 is formed. The hydroxyl groups of 18 are converted to leaving groups X in a manner analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 2 to 3 to form 19. Treatment of 19 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 20. Treatment of 20 with a suitable thiolate reagent with heating as required forms an intermediate sulfide, which is oxidized to sulfoxides or sulfones 21 in a manner analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 5 to 6 or 7. In some cases it may be advantageous to displace one of the X groups of 19 with a group \"Prot\" followed by reaction with a thiolate reagent to form 22. \"Prot\" is intended to be a group, for example alkoxy, which can be subsequently conveniently reverted to a leaving group X, for example to afford 23. Conversion of 23 to 24 is effected under conditions analogous to, or if needed, more forcing than, those that used to effect conversion of 19 to 20. Conversion of 24 to 21 is carried out under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for the conversion of 5 to 6 or 7. \n\n Scheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 22 23 24 \n\n\n [00222] In Scheme 5 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of thienopyridines 29. A suitable halothiophene carboxylic ester 25 is treated with 2- acetamidoacrylate ester in the presence of a Pd catalyst, for example palladium acetate, with heating in a suitable solvent such as DMF to form 26. The hydroxyl group of 26 is converted to a leaving group X to form 27 in a manner analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 2 to 3. Treatment of 27 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, produces ketone 28. Treatment of 28 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 29. \n\n heme 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00223] In Scheme 6 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of thienopyridines 34. In a manner analogous to procedures described in \n\n\nWO2003/ 106421, a suitable methylthiophene carbonitrile 30 is deprotonated using strong base and then treated with a suitably activated carboxylic acid 12, wherein Y may be alkoxy or -N(Me)OMe, to form ketone 31. Treatment of 31 under acidic conditions effects ring closure to the fused hydroxypyridine derivative 32. The hydroxyl group of 32 is converted to a leaving group X to form 33 in a fashion analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 2 to 3. Treatment of 33 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 34. Scheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00224] In Scheme 7 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of thienopyridines 39. As described by Barker, et al. (J. Chem. Res. 1985, 5, 214- \n\n 215), treatment of a suitable aminothiophene carboxylic ester 35 with a dialkyl malonate such as 35a affords amide 36. Alternatively, as described in \n\n\nWO2006/61642, treatment of 35 with an alkyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate in the presence of a tertiary amine base affords 36. Treatment of 36 with a base such as sodium hydride or an alkoxide with heating effects ring closure, which is followed by ester hydrolysis and decarboxylation to afford 37. Conversion of 37 to 39 via 38 is effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 4 for conversion of 18 to 21. \n\n\nScheme 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00225] In Scheme 8 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of thienopyridines 44. As described in US5026700, treatment of a suitable aminothiophene 40 with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate in refluxing alcohol solvent affords fused hydroxypyridine 41 Alternatively, dialkyl 2-oxosuccinate may be substituted for dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate. Conversion of 41 to 44 via 42 and 43 may be effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 5 for converting 26 to 29. \n\n Scheme 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00226] In Scheme 9 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of thienopyridines 48. A suitable aminothiophene 40 is acetylated under Friedel- Crafts conditions and then the amino group is acylated with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 12 to afford amide 45. Ring closure to 46 is effected by treatment with a base such as hydroxide or alkoxide with heating as required. \n\n\nConversion of 46 to 48 via 47 is effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 6 for conversion of 32 to 34. \n\n\nScheme 9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 47 48 \n\n\n [00227] In Scheme 10 are illustrated representative examples by which the keto group in any of 11 (Scheme 2), 29 (Scheme 5), or 44 (Scheme 8) can be further modified to afford additional compounds of the invention. Treatment of ketone with Lawesson's reagent affords thioketones 49. Treatment of ketone with an amine, \n\n hydroxylamine, or alkoxylamine under dehydrating conditions optionally in the presence of acid with heating affords, respectively, imines, oximes, or O-alkyl oximes 50. Treatment of ketone with a Wittig reagent or Horner-Emmons reagent affords olefins 51. Treatment of ketone with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride affords secondary alcohols 52. Treatment of ketone with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound affords tertiary alcohols 53. Heating ketone with an alcohol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords ketals 54. Heating ketone with a 1,2- 1,3- or 1, 4 diol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords cyclic ketals 55. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 10 (continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00228] In Scheme 11 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 12 used in Schemes 3, 6, and 9. A carboxylic acid derivative 56, where Y' is for example alkoxy or a subsequently removable chiral auxiliary, is deprotonated at the alpha position with a strong base and treated with an alkylating agent to afford 57. The sequence is repeated with the same or a different alkylating agent to form 58. The Y' group of 58 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 12 that is suitable for use in Scheme 3, 6, or 9. \n\n\nScheme 11 \n\n\n\n\n\n 56 57 58 \n\n\n 12 \n\n\n[00229] In Scheme 12 is illustrated an alternative method for preparing acids 12 used in Schemes 3, 6, and 9. A suitable carboxylic acid derivative, following conversion with base to an enolate 59 or its equivalent is treated with an aryl halide, or more suitably with a heteroaryl halide to form 61. The Y' group of 61 is then \n\n converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 12 that is suitable for use in Scheme 3, 6, or 9. \n\n\nScheme 12 \n\n\n\n\n\n 59 60 61 \n\n\n [00230] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that standard functional group manipulations may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention from products or intermediates prepared as described by the foregoing methods. In Scheme 13 are shown representative examples that are intended to illustrate, but in no way to limit the scope of, such standard functional group manipulations. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R\n13\n = heteroaryl, -C(0)-R\nv\n' C(0)OR\nw\n, etc. \n\n\n 67 \n\n\nScheme 13 (continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00231] Aminoazole or azolyl amine intermediates employed herein may be obtained either via commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Scheme 14 illustrates representative methods that may be employed for the preparation of additional aminoazoles or azolyl amines. For example, nitroazoles 73 may be converted to aminoazoles 74 via treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n in a suitable solvent such as DCE or EtOH optionally in the presence of HC1, with heating. Alternatively, treatment of 73 with activated iron or zinc metal in HO Ac with heating, will afford 74. Alternatively, treatment of 73 with palladium metal on activated carbon in the presence of > 1 atmosphere pressure of hydrogen gas, in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or EtOAc or mixtures of these, at rt or with heating as required, will afford 74. Alternatively treatment of 73 with sodium hydrosulfite in a suitable solvent mixture such as THF and water at rt or with heating as required, will afford 74. Alternatively, aminoazoles 74 may also be obtained from azole carboxylic acids 75 via initial treatment with diphenylphosphoryl \n\n azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, followed by hydrolysis. Alternatively, treatment of 75 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in the presence of excess tert-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, will afford a tert-butylcarbamoyl azole intermediate, which upon treatment with an acid such as TFA or HC1 in a suitable solvent, will afford 74. \n\n\nAminoazoles 74 may also be obtained from azolyl bromides or iodides 76, bearing (as required) suitable protecting groups on any azole ring N-H positions, via initial treatment with a suitable amino containing reagent (where P = protecting group), such as benzophenone imine, 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, or tert-butyl carbamate, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable organopalladium-complex, and optionally in the presence of a suitable phosphine-ligand, and optionally in the presence of a suitable base, and in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature or under microwave conditions, to afford intermediate 77. Subsequent N-deprotection of intermediate 77 (including azole ring N-deprotection, where required), employing appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art will afford 74. Conversion of aminoazoles 74 to alkylated aminoazoles 78 may be achieved via treatment of 74 with an appropriate aldehyde or ketone substrate, in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as TMSCl or TiCl\n4\n and a reducing agent such as sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, THF, or MeOH, optionally in the presence of HO Ac, at rt or with heating as required. \n\n\nAlternatively, 78 may be obtained via treatment of 74 with an alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable organic base such as pyridine or DIEA, and sodium or potassium iodide, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF or THF, at rt or with heating as required. Nitroazoles 73, azole carboxylic acids 75, and azole bromides or iodides 76 may be obtained from commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\nScheme 14 \n\n\n[00232] \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n P = protecting group \n\n\n\n\n\n 74 78 \n\n\n[00233] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation. Thus, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that conditions such as choice of solvent, temperature of reaction, volumes, reaction time may vary while still producing the desired compounds. In addition, one of skill in the art will also appreciate that many of the reagents provided in the following examples may be substituted with other suitable reagents.

For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for\n\n\n30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween\n\n\n20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\n Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20,\n\n\n6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- \n\n well plates in a final volume of 34 μί, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 μί. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S10, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386 kinases. \n\n\n[00317] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 10 μΜ against JAK2. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 1 μΜ against JAK2. \n\n\n [00318] In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK3. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 10 μΜ against JAK3.

After 16 hour incubation, cells were seeded at 2xl0\n5\n cell/well in 50 μΐ volume, into Costar, clear bottom, 96- well assay plates. Serial dilutions of compounds were added to the plates with final DMSO concentration at 0.5% and GM-CSF at 2ng/mL and the plates were then incubated at 30°C and 5% C0\n2\n for 4 hours. The plates were brought to room temperature before adding Substrate Mixture according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Catalog # K1085). The assay plates containing the substrate mixture were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 hours.

Description\n\n\n\n\n 5-HT\n2B\n RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel fluorinated piperidine derivatives having antagonistic activity at the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and their use as a medicine. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nCisapride is a serotonin 5-HT\n4\n receptor agonist useful as a gastroprokinetic drug. \n\n\n It interacts significantly with several other receptors such as 5-HT\n2\nA and 5-HT\n2\nc; D\n2L\n; 5-HT\n3\nA/B; Alphas, Alpha\n2\nA, Alpha\n2\nB and Alpha\n2\nc. It was withdrawn from some markets in 2000 due to reports of sudden cardiac arrhythmias. At the origin of this side effect is drug-induced QT prolongation by blockade of the hERG potassium channel (human ether-a-go-go related gene). One of the known pharmacophores of a hERG channel blocker comprises a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic moiety linked by a middle part having a basic nitrogen atom. At physiological pH, the basic nitrogen is protonated and is involved in cation-π interaction with Tyr 652 residues within the hERG channel pore. In order to lower the pKa value of piperidine nitrogen atom, and thereby reduce the likelihood of blockade of the hERG channel, derivatives of cisapride were prepared wherein 3-methoxy-piperidine was replaced by 3-fluoropiperidine and 3,3- difluoropiperidine. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThe present invention concerns a compound of formula (I) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor a stereochemical^ isomeric form thereof, wherein \n\n\n R is hydrogen or fluoro, or \n\n\nan addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\nIllustrative of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any of the compounds described above. An illustration of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition made by mixing any of the \n\n compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Illustrating the invention is a process for making a pharmaceutical composition comprising mixing any of the compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n Exemplifying the invention are methods of treating a disorder mediated by the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions described above. \n\n\n Further exemplifying the invention are methods of inhibiting the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions described above. \n\n\n An example of the invention is a method of treating a disorder selected from the group consisting of pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, irritable bowel syndrome, cardiovascular disorders such as chronic heart disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions described above. \n\n\n Another example of the invention is any of the compounds described above for use in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, irritable bowel syndrome, cardiovascular disorders such as chronic heart disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension, in a subject in need thereof. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention is directed to compounds of formula (I) as defined hereinbefore, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of formula (I) are selective antagonists at the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor. \n\n\n In an embodiment of the present invention, R is fluoro and the compound is a racemic mixture or an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is fluoro and the compound has an optical rotation [a] = +14. Γ (c=0.3, MeOH, λ = 598 nm; 20°C), \n\n\nor an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is fluoro and the compound has an optical rotation [a] = -14.4° (c=0.3, MeOH, λ = 598 nm; 20°C), \n\n\nor an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is hydrogen and the substituents in position 3 and 4 of the piperidine moiety have a cis orientation, or an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is hydrogen, the substituents in position 3 and 4 of the piperidine moiety have a cis orientation and the compound has an optical rotation [a] = +39.8° (c=0.2, MeOH, λ = 598 nm; 20°C), \n\n\nor an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is hydrogen, the substituents in position 3 and 4 of the piperidine moiety have a cis orientation and the compound has an optical rotation [a] = -45.5° (c=0.2, MeOH, λ = 598 nm; 20°C), \n\n\nor an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is hydrogen and the substituents in position 3 and 4 of the piperidine moiety have a trans orientation, or an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is hydrogen, the substituents in position 3 and 4 of the piperidine moiety have a trans orientation and the compound has an optical rotation [a] = +19.2° (c=0.4, MeOH, λ = 598 nm; 20°C), \n\n\nor an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the present invention, R is hydrogen, the substituents in position 3 and 4 of the piperidine moiety have a trans orientation and the compound has an optical rotation [a] = -22.8° (c=0.3, MeOH, λ = 598 nm; 20°C), \n\n\nor an addition salt or a solvate thereof. \n\n\n As anticipated, the fluorinated cisapride derivatives are significantly less potent hERG channel blockers than cisapride and thus much less likely to cause drug-induced QT prolongation. Unexpectedly though, the receptor affinities change in various ways so as to yield compounds with a more selective profile. Affinities for 5-HT\n2\nA and D\n2L\n receptors diminish significantly, and for 5-HT\n3\nA/B, 5-HT\n4B\n, AlphaiA, Alpha\n2\nA, Alpha\n2\nB and Alpha\n2\nc receptors they show a trend to a reduction. The only exception is the affinity for the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor which increases significantly. \n\n\n 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonists are indicated for the treatment or the prevention of pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis or irritable bowel syndrome. Pulmonary arterial hypertension may be idiopathic, familial, or associated with other diseases such as HIV infection, or use of certain drugs. It may also be associated with heart or lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), \n\n interstitial lung disease or chronic exposure to high altitude. Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of the alveolar walls, with steadily progressing dyspnea, resulting finally in death from oxygen lack or right heart failure. Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic noninflammatory disease characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habits consisting of diarrhea or constipation or both, and no pathological change. It is a common disorder with a psychophysiological basis. The 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonists may also be used to treat cardiovascular disorders such as chronic heart disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension. \n\n\nDEFINITIONS \n\n\n The term \"subject\" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who is or has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment. \n\n\n The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein, means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. \n\n\n It will be appreciated that some of the compounds according to formula (I) and the addition salts, hydrates and solvates thereof may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereoisomeric forms. \n\n\n The term \"stereoisomeric forms\" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds according to formula (I) and their addition salts may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible \n\n\nstereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms according to formula (I) and their salts, solvates, substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other isomers. \n\n Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Preferably, wherein the compound is present as an enantiomer, the enantiomer is present at an enantiomeric excess of greater than or equal to about 80%, more preferably, at an enantiomeric excess of greater than or equal to about 90%), more preferably still, at an enantiomeric excess of greater than or equal to about 95%), more preferably still, at an enantiomeric excess of greater than or equal to about 98%o, most preferably, at an enantiomeric excess of greater than or equal to about 99%.

In addition, some of the compounds of the present invention may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention. \n\n\n For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention refer to nontoxic \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\". Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g., quaternary ammonium salts. \n\n\n Representative acids which may be used in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, the following: acetic acid, 2,2-dichloro- acetic acid, acylated amino acids, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, L-aspartic \n\n acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 4- acetamidobenzoic acid, (+)-camphoric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, cyclamic acid, ethane- 1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy- ethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, glucoheptonic acid, D-gluconic acid, D-glucoronic acid, L-glutamic acid, beta-oxo- glutaric acid, glycolic acid, hippuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, (+)-L- lactic acid, (±)-DL-lactic acid, lactobionic acid, maleic acid, (-)-L-malic acid, malonic acid, (±)-DL-mandelic acid, meglumine, methanesulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, naphthalene- 1,5- disulfonic acid, l-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, nicotinic acid, nitric acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pamoic acid, phosphoric acid, L- pyroglutamic acid, salicylic acid, 4-amino-salicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid, tannic acid, (+)-L-tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p- toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoromethylsulfonic acid, and undecylenic acid. Some of the compounds according to formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. \n\n\nPHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS \n\n\n The present invention also provides compositions for preventing or treating diseases in which inhibition of pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis is beneficial. \n\n\n Said compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. \n\n\n While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the present invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The carrier or diluent must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. A therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base form or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is \n\n combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for systemic administration such as oral, percutaneous or parenteral administration; or topical administration such as inhalation or insufflation. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case \n\n\nappropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. \n\n\n It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, \n\n\nsuppositories, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, powders for inhalation, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. \n\n\n The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the \n\n condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. \n\n\n Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will comprise from 0.05 to 99 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 70 % by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the active ingredient, and, from 1 to 99.95 % by weight, preferably from 30 to 99.9 % by weight, more preferably from 50 to 99.9 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. \n\n\n The present compounds can be used for systemic administration such as oral, percutaneous or parenteral administration; or topical administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray, eye drops or via a cream, gel, shampoo or the like. The compounds are preferably orally administered. The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound according to formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. \n\n\n The amount of a compound of Formula (I) that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the disease treated, the mammalian species, and the particular mode of administration. However, as a general guide, suitable unit doses for the compounds of the present invention can, for example, preferably contain between 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg of the active compound. A preferred unit dose is between 1 mg to about 500 mg. A more preferred unit dose is between 1 mg to about 300 mg. Even more preferred unit dose is between 1 mg to about 100 mg. Such unit doses can be administered more than once a day, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, but preferably 1 or 2 times per day, so that the total dosage for a 70 kg adult is in the range of 0.001 to about 15 mg per kg weight of subject per administration. A preferred dosage is 0.01 to about 1.5 mg per kg weight of subject per administration, and such therapy can extend for a number of weeks or months, and in some cases, years. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any \n\n particular patient will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs that have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those of skill in the area. \n\n\n A typical dosage can be one 1 mg to about 100 mg tablet or 1 mg to about 300 mg taken once a day, or, multiple times per day, or one time-release capsule or tablet taken once a day and containing a proportionally higher content of active ingredient. The time-release effect can be obtained by capsule materials that dissolve at different pH values, by capsules that release slowly by osmotic pressure, or by any other known means of controlled release. \n\n\n It can be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to start, interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient response. \n\n\nThe following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the scope of the present invention.

Various concentrations of the non-labelled test compound were added to the incubation mixture with the membrane fraction, containing the receptor of interest, and a fixed low concentration (nM) of the radioligand. During the incubation the radioligand bound to the receptor, but this was inhibited by the non-labelled test compound in proportion to its binding affinity and concentration. \n\n\n Cell lines were established that stably express the human variant of the receptor under investigation after transfection with the appropriate cDNA (Table 1). Transfected cells were grown under standard culture conditions, and membrane fractions were obtained upon centrifugation and homogenisation of the cells. Optimal membrane dilutions for binding studies were determined and aliquots were stored at -70°C until use. In a 96- well plate format, the appropriate radioligand was added to the membrane preparation containing the receptor under investigation. Compound solutions were prepared in DMSO, and diluted 100-fold into the multiwell plate to a final test concentration of\n\n\n10\n\"9\n to 10\n\"5\n M. After incubation with the test compound, the unbound radioligand was removed by filtration on G/F filters with a Filtermate 96. Microscint™ was added to the washed filter plates and the radioactivity bound to the receptor was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a TopCount (Packard). To measure the Non-Specific Binding (NSB), a high concentration of the non-radiolabeled ligand was added to wells containing the membrane fraction and the radioligand. \n\n\nTable 1 : Summary of assay conditions for inhibition of radioligand binding to the receptors evaluated. \n\n\nReceptor Cell line Radioligand Cone.

Using in house developed software, a best-fit curve was fitted by a minimum sum of squares method to the plot of % inhibition vs. concentration of the test compound. From this, the pIC50 value \n\n\n (inhibitory concentration causing 50 % displacement of specific binding) was determined, as well as an estimate of the slope of the plot (Hill coefficient). \n\n\nTable 2 : pIC\n5\no values \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The reference compound (Ref.) is cisapride. \n\n Example 5 : 5-HT R antagonism \n\n\n CHO-K1 (ECACC) cells were stably transfected with human 5-HT\n2B\n receptor cDNA subcloned into pCDNA3.1 using the calcium phosphate method. Stably transfected cell lines were selected using G-418, and clonal cell lines were developed by limit dilution. Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% heat inactivated dialyzed foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1%) L-glutamine and 1% non-essential amino acids. \n\n\n Confluent monolayers plated into black 96 well plates with clear bottoms were loaded with 4 μΜ Fluo-3-AM for 90 min at 37°C in Hanks balanced salt solution \n\n\nsupplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid. After washing, the test compound was added to the cells and maximal fluorescence in response to 0.1 nM serotonin was recorded using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) to detect changes in intracellular calcium levels. \n\n\n The maximal fluorescence recorded in the presence of the test compound was expressed as a percent of the maximal fluorescence response to the agonist serotonin (0.1 nM). The IC\n50\n value was determined by non-linear regression analysis of the concentration-response curves generated with mean replicate values using Hill equation curve fitting (Y = D + [(A - D)/(l + (C/C\n50\n)nH)], where Y = specific response, D = minimum specific response (no drugs or serotonin added), A = maximum specific response (0.1 nM serotonin, no drugs), C = concentration of compound, and C\n50\n = IC\n50\n, and nH = slope factor) (SigmaPlot® 4.0, SPSS Inc.). The apparent dissociation constant (K\nB\n) was calculated using the modified Cheng Prusoff equation (K\nB\n = \n\n\nIC5O/(1+(A/EC5OA)), where A = concentration of serotonin, and EC50A = EC50 value of serotonin in this assay). (Porter et al. (1999), Br. J. Pharmacol, 128: 13-20) \n\n\nTable 3 : 5-HT\n2B\n antagonism \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6 : hERG-transfected HEK293 cells using a Patch Express apparatus. \n\n\nExperiments were performed using HEK293 cells stably expressing the hERG potassium channel. Cells were grown at 37°C and 5% C0\n2\n in culture flasks in ] Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% L- \n\n Glutamine-Penicillin-Streptomycin-solution, 1% non-essential amino acids (lOOx), 1% sodium pyruvate (lOOmM) and 0.8% Geneticin (50mg/ml). Before use the cells were subcultured in MEM medium in the absence of 5 ml L-Glutamine-Penicillin- Streptomycin. For use in the automated patch-clamp system PatchXpress 7000A (Axon Instruments) cells were harvested to obtain cell suspension of single cells. \n\n\n Extracellular solution contained (mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 1.8 CaCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 5 Glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Pipette solution contained (mM): 120 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n (pH 7.2 with KOH). \n\n\nPatch-clamp experiments were performed in the voltage-clamp mode and whole-cell currents were recorded with an automated patch-clamp assay utilizing the PatchXpress 7000A system (Axon Instruments). Current signals were amplified and digitized by a Multiclamp amplifier, stored and analyzed by using the PatchXpress, DataXpress software and Igor 5.0 (Wavemetrics). \n\n\n The holding potential was -80 mV. The hERG current (K+-selective outward current) was determined as the maximal tail current at -40 mV after a 2 second depolarization to +60 mV. Pulse cycling rate was 15 s. Before each test pulse a short pulse (0.5 s) from the holding potential to -60 mV was given to determine (linear) leak current. \n\n\nAfter establishing whole-cell configuration and a stability period, the vehicle (aqueous DMSO control) was applied for 5 minutes followed by the test substance by increasing concentrations of 10\n\"7\n M, 3 x 10\n\"7\n M and 3 x 10\n\"6\n M. \n\n\n Each concentration of the test substance was applied twice. The effect of each concentration was determined after 5 min as an average current of 3 sequential voltage pulses. To determine the extent of block the residual current was compared with vehicle pre-treatment. Data are expressed as % block at the indicated concentrations in Table 4. The values between brackets refer to % block by the vehicle. \n\n\nTable 4 : % block of the hERG channel \n\n\nConcentration 100 nM 300 nM 3000 nM\n\n\nCisapride 80 (7) 95 (15) not tested\n\n\n(±)-7 35 (7) 62 (15) 94 (21)\n\n\n(±)-12 40 (7) 73 (15) 96 (21)\n\n\n(±)-17 9 (7) 17 (15) 58 (21)\n\n\n(+)-17 14 (7) 21 (10) 52 (11)\n\n\n(-)-17 3(7) 11 (10) 47 (11) \n\n Example 7: Monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in the rat \n\n\nCompound (-)-17 was tested in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in the rat (see e.g., Stenmark et al, 2009, Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 297, L1013-L1032). Measurements included: mean arterial blood pressure and right ventricular pressure in vivo, ratio of right ventricular weight to left ventricular weight plus septum as an index of right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary artery acceleration time, and histological assessement of muscularization of pulmonary arteries. \n\n\nMonocrotaline was dissolved in 1 N HC1 and then into distilled water, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH. A single dose of 60 mg/kg monocrotaline was \n\n\nadministered subcutaneously on day 0 to three groups of male Sprague Dawley rats. The test article Compound (-)-17 was dissolved in 20% hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin with NaOH, HC1 and mannitol in pyrogen-free water and administered orally by gavage (10 ml/kg) once daily from day 1 for 21 days at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations of Compound (-)-17 were measured 2 hours \n\n\n (approximate Cmax after oral dosing in rats) after the final administration on day 21. Corresponding volumes of 20% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin vehicle were administered orally according to the same protocol in a third group of animals. Three-week treatments with Compound (-)-17 at 10 mg p.o. once daily (mean plasma concentration 2 hours post-dosing at day 21 -80 ng/ml) and at 50 mg p.o. once daily (mean plasma concentration -1,000 ng/ml) were non-toxic, and had no effect on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), but reduced right ventricular pressure (RVP), right ventricular hypertrophy (right ventricle/(left ventricle + septum); RV/(LV+S)), and increased pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) (Table 5). The mean wall thickness of small pulmonary arteries was significantly increased by monocrotaline treatment, and this thickening was reduced by a three-week treatment with Compound (-)-17 at 50 mg/kg p.o. (P=0.0539) and at 10 mg p.o. (P<0.005).

Clin. Pharm.; 2002; 16: 125-140). \n\n\nCompound (-)-17 was dissolved in 20% hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin with NaOH, HC1 and mannitol in pyrogen- free water and administered intravenously (0.5ml/kg) in increasing doses (0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) over a period of 5 min at 15- min intervals. Plasma concentrations of Compound (-)-17 were measured at the end of each infusion. Corresponding volumes of vehicle were administered according to the same protocol in a second group of animals. \n\n\nRelative to vehicle, Compound (-)-17 at 0.16 up to 5 mg/kg (total dose: 9.87 mg/kg; Cmax: 11,950 ng/ml) had no relevant effect on heart rate, the duration of the PQ, QRS, QT and QTcB intervals, or on ECG morphology in the anesthetized guinea-pig (Table 6). From 2.5 mg/kg onwards (Cmax: 6,325 ng/ml; Table 7), mean arterial blood pressure started to increase (Table 6). The reference compound dofetilide (0.02 mg/kg i.v. over 1 min), given 15 min after the onset of the last infusion of vehicle, decreased heart rate and prolonged the QT and QTcB intervals. \n\n\nTable 6: Effects of Compound (-)-17 before and at 2, 5 and 15 minutes after onset of each infusion, expressed as percentage changes relative to baseline values on heart rate (FIR), mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and on ECG parameters in anesthesized guinea pigs.

Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 174(5):550-6). Thereafter Compound (-)-17 is administered once daily for 2 weeks at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg p.o. Post-mortem examination includes gross pathology, lung weights and lung histopathology on Day \n\n 15. Histopathological examination of the lungs indicates that bleomycin causes inflammation followed by fibrosis in the lungs in untreated mice. \n\n\nExample 10: Pharmacokinetic evaluation in the mouse \n\n\nFor intravenous (i.v.) administration, Compound (-)-17 was dissolved in saline containing 20% (w/v) hydroxy-propyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) at a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL and administered (10 mL/kg) to male CD1 mice (n =3) as a bolus via a tail vein at a dose level of 2.5 mg/kg. For oral (p.o.) administration, Compound (-)-17 was dissolved in water containing 20% (w/v) FtPbCD at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and administered (20 mL/kg) to male CD1 mice (n =3) via gavage at a dose level of 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected via a saphenous vein at serial time points up to 24 h after dosing. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation and stored at -20°C prior to analysis. Analysis was performed using liquid chromatography (LC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS) in positive ion mode. Compound (-)-17 was eluted from a reversed phase column with a gradient of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. At the time of analysis plasma samples (20 uL) were thawed and deprotonated with 200 uL of acetonitrile and centrifuged.

Description\n\n\n\n\n VEGF-BINDING MOLECULES \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThe invention relates to the field of human therapy, in particular cancer therapy and agents and compositions useful in such therapy. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nAs described in e.g. US 2008/0014196 and WO2008101985, angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of disorders, including solid tumors and metastasis as well as eye diseases. One of the most important pro- angiogenic factors is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also termed VEGF-A or vascular permeability factor (VPF). VEGF belongs to a gene family that includes placenta growth factor (PIGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E and VEGF-F. Alternative splicing of mRNA of a single gene of human VEGF results in at least six isoforms (VEGF121 , VEGF145, VEGF165, \n\n\nVEGF183, VEGF189, and VEGF206), VEGF165 being the most abundant isoform. \n\n\nTwo VEGF tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR) have been identified that interact with VEGF, i.e. VEGFR-1 (also known as Flt-1 ) and VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or FIK-1 ). VEGFR-1 has the highest affinity for VEGF, while VEGFR- 2 has a somewhat lower affinity for VEGF. Ferrara (Endocrine Rev. 2004, 25: 581 -61 1 ) provide a detailed description of VEGF, the interaction with its receptors and its function in normal and pathological processes can be found in Hoeben et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004, 56: 549-580. \n\n\nVEGF has been reported to be a pivotal regulator of both normal and abnormal angiogenesis (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, Endocrine Rev. 1997, 18: 4-25; \n\n Ferrara J. MoL Med. 1999, 77: 527-543). Compared to other growth factors that contribute to the processes of vascular formation, VEGF is unique in its high specificity for endothelial cells within the vascular system. \n\n\nVEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors. In the case of tumor growth, angiogenesis appears to be crucial for the transition from hyperplasia to neoplasia, and for providing nourishment for the growth and metastasis of the tumor (Folkman et al., 1989, Nature 339 -58), which allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage compared to the normal cells. Therefore, anti-angiogenesis therapies have become an important treatment option for several types of tumors. These therapies have focused on blocking the VEGF pathway (Ferrara et al., Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2004 May; 3(5): \n\n\n391 -400. \n\n\nVEGF is also involved in eye diseases. The concentration of VEGF in eye fluids is highly correlated with the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Up-regulation of VEGF has also been observed in various inflammatory disorders. VEGF has been implicated in the \n\n\npathogenesis of RA, an inflammatory disease in which angiogenesis plays a significant role. \n\n\nThe elucidation of VEGF and its role in angiogenesis and different processes has provided a potential new target of therapeutic intervention. The function of VEGF has been inhibited by small molecules that block or prevent activation of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases (Schlaeppi and Wood, 1999, Cancer \n\n\nMetastasis Rev., 18: 473-481 ) and consequently interfere with the VEGF receptor signal transduction pathway. Cytotoxic conjugates containing bacterial or plant toxins can inhibit the stimulating effect of VEGF on tumor \n\n angiogenesis. VEGF-DT385 toxin conjugates (diphtheria toxin domains fused or chemically conjugated to VEGF165), for example, efficiently inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Tumor growth inhibition could also be achieved by delivering a Flk-1 mutant or soluble VEGF receptors by a retrovirus. \n\n\nVEGF-neutralizing antibodies, such as A4.6.I and MV833, have been developed to block VEGF from binding to its receptors and have shown preclinical antitumor activity (Kim et al. Nature 1993, 362: 841 -844; Folkman Nat. Med. 1995, 1 : 27-31 ; Presta et al. Cancer Res. 1997, 57: 4593-4599; Kanai et al. Int. J. Cancer 1998, 77: 933-936; Ferrara and Alitalo Nat. Med. 1999, 5: 1359-1364; 320, 340. For a review of therapeutic anti-VEGF approaches trials, see Campochiaro and Hackett (Oncogene 2003, 22: \n\n\n6537-6548). \n\n\nMost clinical experience has been obtained with A4.6.1 , also called \n\n\nbevacizumab (Avastin®; Genentech, San Francisco, CA). \n\n\nWO2008101985 describes immunoglobulin single variable domains from camelides (VHHs or \"Nanobodies®, as defined herein) that bind to VEGF, and their use in the treatment of conditions and diseases characterized by excessive and/or pathological angiogenesis or neovascularization. \n\n\nIt has been an object of the present invention to provide novel improved VEGF-binding molecules. \n\n\nIt has been a further object of the invention to provide methods for the prevention, treatment, alleviation and/or diagnosis of such diseases, disorders or conditions, involving the use and/or administration of such agents and compositions. In particular, it is has been an object of the invention to provide such pharmacologically active agents, compositions and/or methods that provide advantages compared to the agents, compositions and/or methods currently used and/or known in the art. These advantages include improved \n\n therapeutic and/or pharmacological properties and/or other advantageous properties, e.g. for manufacturing purposes, especially as compared to conventional anti-VEGF antibodies as those described above, or fragments thereof. \n\n\nMore in particular, it has been an object of the invention to provide novel VEGF-binding molecules, and, specifically, VEGF-binding molecules that bind to mammalian VEGF and, especially, human VEGF, wherein such molecules or polypeptides are suitable for the therapeutic and diagnostic purposes as described herein. It has been a further object of the invention to provide immunoglobulin single variable domains that specifically bind to VEGF. \n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nAccording to a first aspect, there are provided VEGF-binding molecules, preferably VEGF-binding immunoglobulin single variable domains like VHHs and domain antibodies. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to nucleic acids encoding VEGF- binding molecules as well as host cells containing such nucleic acids. \n\n\nThe invention further relates to a product or composition containing or comprising at least one VEGF-binding molecule of the invention and optionally one or more further components of such compositions. \n\n\nThe invention further relates to methods for preparing or generating the VEGF-binding molecules, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein. \n\n\nThe invention further relates to applications and uses of the VEGF-binding molecules, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein, as well as to methods for the prevention and/or treatment for diseases associated with VEGF-mediated effects on angiogenesis. \n\n These and other aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow. \n\n\nDEFINITIONS \n\n\nUnless indicated or defined otherwise, all terms used have their usual meaning in the art, which will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example made to the standard handbooks, such as Sambrook et al, \"Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\" (2nd Ed.), Vols. 1 -3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989); Lewin, \"Genes IV\", Oxford University Press, New York, (1990), and Roitt et al., \"Immunology\" (2\nnd\n Ed.), Gower Medical Publishing, London, New York (1989), as well as to the general background art cited herein; \n\n\nFurthermore, unless indicated otherwise, all methods, steps, techniques and manipulations that are not specifically described in detail can be performed and have been performed in a manner known perse, as will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example again made to the standard handbooks, to the general background art referred to above and to the further references cited therein. \n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, the terms \"immunoglobulin\" and \"immunoglobulin sequence\" - whether used herein to refer to a heavy chain antibody or to a conventional 4-chain antibody - are used as general terms to include both the full-size antibody, the individual chains thereof, as well as all parts, domains or fragments thereof (including but not limited to antigen-binding domains or fragments such as VHH domains or VH/VL domains, respectively). In addition, the term \"sequence\" as used herein (for example in terms like \"immunoglobulin sequence\", \"antibody sequence\", \"(single) variable domain sequence\", \"VHH sequence\" or \"protein sequence\"), should generally be understood to include both the relevant amino acid sequence as well as nucleic acid sequences or nucleotide sequences encoding the same, unless the context requires a more limited interpretation. \n\n The term \"domain\" (of a polypeptide or protein) as used herein refers to a folded protein structure which has the ability to retain its tertiary structure independently of the rest of the protein. Generally, domains are responsible for discrete functional properties of proteins, and in many cases may be added, removed or transferred to other proteins without loss of function of the remainder of the protein and/or of the domain. \n\n\nThe term \"immunoglobulin domain\" as used herein refers to a globular region of an antibody chain (such as e.g. a chain of a conventional 4-chain antibody or of a heavy chain antibody), or to a polypeptide that essentially consists of such a globular region. Immunoglobulin domains are characterized in that they retain the immunoglobulin fold characteristic of antibody molecules, which consists of a 2-layer sandwich of about 7 antiparallel beta-strands arranged in two beta-sheets, optionally stabilized by a conserved disulphide bond. \n\n\nThe term \"immunoglobulin variable domain\" as used herein means an immunoglobulin domain essentially consisting of four \"framework regions\" which are referred to in the art and hereinbelow as \"framework region 1 \" or \"FR1 \"; as \"framework region 2\" or\"FR2\"; as \"framework region 3\" or \"FR3\"; and as \"framework region 4\" or \"FR4\", respectively; which framework regions are interrupted by three \"complementarity determining regions\" or \"CDRs\", which are referred to in the art and hereinbelow as \"complementarity determining region Tor \"CDR1 \"; as \"complementarity determining region 2\" or \"CDR2\"; and as \"complementarity determining region 3\" or \"CDR3\", respectively. Thus, the general structure or sequence of an immunoglobulin variable domain can be indicated as follows: FR1 - CDR1 - FR2 - CDR2 - FR3 - CDR3 - FR4. It is the immunoglobulin variable domain(s) that confer specificity to an antibody for the antigen by carrying the antigen-binding site. \n\n\nThe term \"immunoglobulin single variable domain\" as used herein means an immunoglobulin variable domain which is capable of specifically binding to an \n\n epitope of the antigen without pairing with an additional variable \n\n\nimmunoglobulin domain. One example of immunoglobulin single variable domains in the meaning of the present invention are \"domain antibodies\", such as the immunoglobulin single variable domains VH and VL (VH domains and VL domains). Another example of immunoglobulin single variable domains are \"VHH domains\" (or simply \"VHHs\") from camelids, as defined hereinafter. \n\n\nIn view of the above definition, the antigen-binding domain of a conventional 4-chain antibody (such as an IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE molecule; known in the art) or of a Fab fragment, a F(ab')2 fragment, an Fv fragment such as a disulphide linked Fv or a scFv fragment, or a diabody (all known in the art) derived from such conventional 4-chain antibody, would normally not be regarded as an immunoglobulin single variable domain, as, in these cases, binding to the respective epitope of an antigen would normally not occur by one (single) immunoglobulin domain but by a pair of (associating) \n\n\nimmunoglobulin domains such as light and heavy chain variable domains, i.e. by a VH-VL pair of immunoglobulin domains, which jointly bind to an epitope of the respective antigen. \n\n\n\"VHH domains\", also known as VHHs, V\nH\nH domains, VHH antibody fragments, and VHH antibodies, have originally been described as the antigen binding immunoglobulin (variable) domain of \"heavy chain antibodies\" (i.e. of \n\n\n\"antibodies devoid of light chains\"; Hamers-Casterman C, Atarhouch T, Muyldermans S, Robinson G, Hamers C, Songa EB, Bendahman N, \n\n\nHamers R. : \"Naturally occurring antibodies devoid of light chains\"; Nature 363, 446-448 (1993)). The term \"VHH domain\" has been chosen in order to distinguish these variable domains from the heavy chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which are referred to herein as \"VH domains\" or \"VH domains\") and from the light chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which are referred to herein as \n\n \"V\nL\n domains\" or \"VL domains\"). VHH domains can specifically bind to an epitope without an additional antigen binding domain (as opposed to VH or VL domains in a conventional 4-chain antibody, in which case the epitope is recognized by a VL domain together with a VH domain). VHH domains are small, robust and efficient antigen recognition units formed by a single immunoglobulin domain. \n\n\nIn the context of the present invention, the terms VHH domain, VHH, V\nH\nH domain, VHH antibody fragment, VHH antibody, as well as \"Nanobody®\" and \"Nanobody® domain\" (\"Nanobody\" being a trademark of the company Ablynx N.V.; Ghent; Belgium) are used interchangeably and are representatives of immunoglobulin single variable domains (having the structure FR1 -CDR1 -FR2- CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4 and specifically binding to an epitope without requiring the presence of a second immunoglobulin variable domain), and which are distinguished from VH domains by the so-called \"hallmark residues\", as defined in e.g. WO2009/109635, Fig. 1 . \n\n\nThe amino acid residues of a immunoglobulin single variable domain, e.g. a VHH, are numbered according to the general numbering for V\nH\n domains given by Kabat et al. (\"Sequence of proteins of immunological interest\", US Public Health Services, NIH Bethesda, MD, Publication No. 91 ), as applied to VHH domains from Camelids, as shown e.g. in Figure 2 of Riechmann and \n\n\nMuyldermans, J. Immunol. Methods 231 , 25-38 (1999). According to this numbering, \n\n\n- FR1 comprises the amino acid residues at positions 1 -30, \n\n\n - CDR1 comprises the amino acid residues at positions 31 -35, \n\n\n - FR2 comprises the amino acids at positions 36-49, \n\n\n - CDR2 comprises the amino acid residues at positions 50-65, \n\n\n - FR3 comprises the amino acid residues at positions 66-94, \n\n - CDR3 comprises the amino acid residues at positions 95-102, and \n\n\n - FR4 comprises the amino acid residues at positions 103-1 13. \n\n\nHowever, it should be noted that - as is well known in the art for V\nH\n domains and for VHH domains - the total number of amino acid residues in each of the CDRs may vary and may not correspond to the total number of amino acid residues indicated by the Kabat numbering (that is, one or more positions according to the Kabat numbering may not be occupied in the actual sequence, or the actual sequence may contain more amino acid residues than the number allowed for by the Kabat numbering). This means that, generally, the numbering according to Kabat may or may not correspond to the actual numbering of the amino acid residues in the actual sequence. \n\n\nAlternative methods for numbering the amino acid residues of V\nH\n domains, which methods can also be applied in an analogous manner to VHH domains, are known in the art. However, in the present description, claims and figures, the numbering according to Kabat and applied to VHH domains as described above will be followed, unless indicated otherwise. \n\n\nThe total number of amino acid residues in a VHH domain will usually be in the range of from 1 10 to 120, often between 1 12 and 1 15. It should however be noted that smaller and longer sequences may also be suitable for the purposes described herein. \n\n\nMethods of obtaining VHHs that bind to a specific antigen or epitope have been described earlier, e.g. in WO2006/040153 and WO2006/122786. As also described therein in detail, VHH domains derived from camelids can be \"humanized\" (also termed \"sequence-optimized\" herein, \"sequence-optimizing\" may, in addition to humanization, encompass an additional modification of the sequence by one or more mutations that furnish the VHH with improved properties, such as the removal of potential post translational modification \n\n sites) by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of the original VHH sequence by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a VH domain from a conventional 4-chain antibody from a human being. A humanized VHH domain can contain one or more fully human framework region sequences, and, in an even more specific embodiment, can contain human framework region sequences derived from DP-29, DP-47, DP-51 , or parts thereof, optionally combined with JH sequences, such as JH5. \n\n\nDomain antibodies, also known as \"Dab\"s and \"dAbs\" (the terms \"Domain Antibodies\" and \"dAbs\" being used as trademarks by the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies) have been described in e.g. Ward, E.S., et al:. \"Binding activities of a repertoire of single immunoglobulin variable domains secreted from Escherichia coli\"; Nature 341 : 544-546 (1989); Holt, L.J. et al.: \"Domain antibodies: proteins for therapy\"; TRENDS in Biotechnology 21 (1 1 ): 484-490 (2003); and WO2003/002609. \n\n\nDomain antibodies essentially correspond to the VH or VL domains of antibodies from non-camelid mammals, in particular human 4-chain antibodies. In order to bind an epitope as a single antigen binding domain, i.e. without being paired with a VL or VH domain, respectively, specific selection for such antigen binding properties is required, e.g. by using libraries of human single VH or VL domain sequences. \n\n\nDomain antibodies have, like VHHs, a molecular weight of approximately 13 to approximately 16 kDa and, if derived from fully human sequences, do not require humanization for e.g. therapeutical use in humans. As in the case of VHH domains, they are well expressed also in prokaryotic expression systems, providing a significant reduction in overall manufacturing cost. \n\n Furthermore, it will also be clear to the skilled person that it is possible to \"graft\" one or more of the CDR's mentioned above onto other \"scaffolds\", including but not limited to human scaffolds or non-immunoglobulin scaffolds. Suitable scaffolds and techniques for such CDR grafting are known in the art. \n\n\nThe terms \"epitope\" and \"antigenic determinant\", which can be used interchangeably, refer to the part of a macromolecule, such as a polypeptide, that is recognized by antigen-binding molecules, such as conventional antibodies or the polypeptides of the invention, and more particularly by the antigen-binding site of said molecules. Epitopes define the minimum binding site for an immunoglobulin, and thus represent the target of specificity of an immunoglobulin. \n\n\nA polypeptide (such as an immunoglobulin, an antibody, an immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention, or generally an antigen-binding molecule or a fragment thereof) that can \"bind to\" or \"specifically bind to\", that \"has affinity for\" and/or that \"has specificity fo a certain epitope, antigen or protein (or for at least one part, fragment or epitope thereof) is said to be \"against\" or \"directed against' said epitope, antigen or protein or is a \"binding\" molecule with respect to such epitope, antigen or protein. In this context, a VEGF-binding molecule may also be referred to as \"VEGF-neutralizing. \n\n\nGenerally, the term \"specificity\" refers to the number of different types of antigens or epitopes to which a particular antigen-binding molecule or antigen- binding protein (such as an immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention) molecule can bind. The specificity of an antigen-binding molecule can be determined based on its affinity and/or avidity. The affinity, represented by the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an antigen with an antigen- binding protein (KD), is a measure for the binding strength between an epitope and an antigen-binding site on the antigen-binding protein: the lesser the value of the KD, the stronger the binding strength between an epitope and the \n\n antigen-binding molecule (alternatively, the affinity can also be expressed as the affinity constant (KA), which is 1/KD). As will be clear to the skilled person (for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein), affinity can be determined in a manner known per se, depending on the specific antigen of interest. Avidity is the measure of the strength of binding between an antigen- binding molecule (such as an immunoglobulin, an antibody, an immunoglobulin single variable domain or a polypeptides containing it and the pertinent antigen. Avidity is related to both the affinity between an epitope and its antigen binding site on the antigen-binding molecule and the number of pertinent binding sites present on the antigen-binding molecule. \n\n\nThe part of an antigen-binding molecule that recognizes the epitope is called a paratope. \n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, the term \"VEGF-binding molecule\" includes anti- VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF antibody fragments, \"anti-VEGF antibody-like molecules\" and conjugates with any of these. Antibodies include, but are not limited to, monoclonal and chimerized monoclonal antibodies. The term „antibody\" encompasses complete immunoglobulins, like monoclonal antibodies produced by recombinant expression in host cells, as well as VEGF-binding antibody fragments or \"antibody-like molecules\", including single-chain antibodies and linear antibodies, so-called \"SMIPs\" (\"Small Modular Immunopharmaceuticals\"), as e.g described in WO02/056910. \n\n\nAnti-VEGF antibody-like molecules include immunoglobulin single variable domains, as defined herein. Other examples for antibody-like molecules are immunoglobulin super family antibodies (IgSF), or CDR-grafted molecules. \n\n\n\"VEGF-binding molecule\" refers to both monovalent VEGF-binding molecules (i.e. molecules that bind to one epitope of VEGF) as well as to bi- or multivalent binding molecules (i.e. binding molecules that bind to more than one epitope, e.g. \"biparatopic\" molecules as defined hereinbelow). \n\n VEGF-binding molecules containing more than one VEGF-binding \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domain are also termed \"formatted\" \n\n\nVEGF-binding molecules, they may, in addition to the VEGF-binding immunoglobulin single variable domains, comprise linkers and/or moieties with effector functions, e.g. half-life-extending moieties like albumin-binding immunoglobulin single variable domains, and/or a fusion partner like serum albumin and/or an attached polymer like PEG. \n\n\nThe term \"biparatopic VEGF-binding molecule\" or \"biparatopic immunoglobulin single variable domain\" as used herein shall mean a VEGF-binding molecule comprising a first immunoglobulin single variable domain and a second immunoglobulin single variable domain as herein defined, wherein the two molecules bind to two different, i.e. non-overlapping epitopes of the VEGF antigen. The biparatopic polypeptides according to the invention are composed of immunoglobulin single variable domains which have different specificities with respect to the epitope. The part of an antigen-binding molecule (such as an antibody or an immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention) that recognizes the epitope is called a paratope. \n\n\nA formatted VEGF-binding molecule may, albeit less preferred, also comprise two identical VEGF-binding immunoglobulin single variable domains or two different immunoglobulin single variable domains that recognize the same or overlapping epitopes. In this case, the two immunoglobulin single variable domains may bind to the same or an overlapping epitope in each of the two monomers that form the VEGF dimer. \n\n\n Typically, the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention will bind with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10E-5 to 10E-14 moles/liter (M) or less, and preferably 10E-7 to 10E-14 moles/liter (M) or less, more preferably 10E-8 to 10E-14 moles/liter, and even more preferably 10E-1 1 to 10E-13 (as measured in a Biacore or in a KinExA assay), and/or with an association constant (K\nA\n) of \n\n at least 10E7 ME-1 , preferably at least 10E8 ME-1 , more preferably at least 10E9 ME-1 , such as at least 10E1 1 ME-1. Any K\nD\n value greater than 10E-4 M is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a polypeptide of the invention will bind to the desired antigen, i.e. VEGF, with a K\nD\n less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or epitope can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, the assays described herein, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art. \n\n\nAmino acid residues will be indicated according to the standard three-letter or one-letter amino acid code, as generally known and agreed upon in the art. When comparing two amino acid sequences, the term \"amino acid difference\" refers to insertions, deletions or substitutions of the indicated number of amino acid residues at a position of the reference sequence, compared to a second sequence. In case of substitution(s), such substitution(s) will preferably be conservative amino acid substitution(s), which means that an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue of similar chemical structure and which has little or essentially no influence on the function, activity or other biological properties of the polypeptide. Such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example from W098/49185, wherein conservative amino acid substitutions preferably are substitutions in which one amino acid within the following groups (i) - (v) is substituted by another amino acid residue within the same group: (i) small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro and Gly; (ii) polar, negatively charged residues and their (uncharged) amides: Asp, Asn, Glu and Gin; (iii) polar, positively charged residues: His, Arg and Lys; (iv) large aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, He, Val and Cys; and (v) aromatic residues: Phe, Tyr and Trp. \n\n Particularly preferred conservative amino acid substitutions are as follows: Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; Asn into Gin or into His; Asp into Glu; Cys into Ser; Gin into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gin; He into Leu or into Val; Leu into He or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gin or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into lie; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser;Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp or into Phe; Val into lie or into Leu. \n\n\nA polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule is considered to be \"(in) essentially isolated (form)\" - for example, when compared to its native biological source and/or the reaction medium or cultivation medium from which it has been obtained - when it has been separated from at least one other component with which it is usually associated in said source or medium, such as another protein/polypeptide, another nucleic acid, another biological component or macromolecule or at least one contaminant, impurity or minor component. In particular, a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule is considered \"essentially isolated\" when it has been purified at least 2-fold, in particular at least 10- fold, more in particular at least 100-fold, and up to 1000-fold or more. A polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule that is \"in essentially isolated form\" is preferably essentially homogeneous, as determined using a suitable technique, such as a suitable chromatographical technique, such as polyacrylamide gel \n\n\nelectrophoresis. \n\n\n\"Sequence identity\" between two VEGF-binding molecule sequences indicates the percentage of amino acids that are identical between the sequences. It may be calculated or determined as described in paragraph f) on pages 49 and 50 of WO08/020079. \"Sequence similarity\" indicates the percentage of amino acids that either are identical or that represent conservative amino acid substitutions. \n\n Alternative methods for numbering the amino acid residues of V\nH\n domains, which methods can also be applied in an analogous manner to VHH domains, are known in the art. However, in the present description, claims and figures, the numbering according to Kabat and applied to VHH domains as described above will be followed, unless indicated otherwise. \n\n\nAn \"affinity-matured\" VEGF-binding molecule, in particular a VHH or a domain antibody, has one or more alterations in one or more CDRs which result in an improved affinity for VEGF, as compared to the respective parent \n\n\nVEGF-binding molecule. Afffinity-matured VEGF-binding molecules of the invention may be prepared by methods known in the art, for example, as described by Marks et al., 1992, Biotechnology 10:779-783, or Barbas, et al.,\n\n\n1994, Proc.

Examples are VHHs having amino acid sequences selected from sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 47 - 57. \n\n\nAccording to certain embodiments, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be formatted, as herein defined, e.g. it may be biparatopic or comprise two identical immunoglobulin single variable domains. Such VEGF-binding molecules may comprise two or more VHHs, which are a) identical VHHs that are capable of blocking the interaction \n\n\n between recombinant human VEGF and the recombinant human VEGFR-2 with an inhibition rate of > 60% or b) different VHHs that bind to non-overlapping epitopes of VEGF, wherein at least one VHH is capable of blocking the interaction between recombinant human VEGF and the recombinant human VEGFR-2 with an inhibition rate of > 60% and wherein at least one VHH binds is capable of blocking said interaction with an inhibition rate of < 60 %. \n\n\nThe percentage of blocking said interaction at an inhibition rate of > 60% or < 60 %, respectively, refers to an inhibition rate as determined by an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (AlphaScreen\n®\n), a competition ELISA, a plasmon resonance (SPR) based assay (Biacore\n®\n) as used in the Examples. \n\n\nIn the following, the ability of VHHs according to a) is also termed \"receptor- blocking\", while the ability of VHHs according to b) is also termed \"non- receptor-blocking\". \n\n Preferably, the receptor-blocking VHHs have an inhibition rate of > 80%, more preferably > 90%; the most preferred VHHs being complete receptor blockers, i.e. have an inhibition rate of 100 %. \n\n\nA VEGF-binding may contain two or more identical VHHs a) selected from VHHs having amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 9 - 46 or VHHs that have been obtained by affinity maturation and/or sequence optimization of such VHH. The VHH may be selected from VHHs having the amino acid shown in SEQ ID NO: 18 or SEQ ID NO: 47 - 57. \n\n\nAccording to preferred embodiments, a formatted VEGF-binding molecule comprises two VHHs each having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 57. \n\n\nIn formatted VEGF-binding molecules comprising two different VHHs a) said one or more VHHs with an inhibition rate of > 60% are \n\n\n selected from i. VHHs having an amino acid sequence selected from amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 9 - 46 or ii.

SEQ ID NOs: 58 - 124 or ii. VHHs that have been obtained by affinity maturation \n\n\n and/or sequence optimization of such VHH. \n\n According to preferred embodiments, two VHHs are contained in polypeptides with amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 128 - 168, separated by linker sequences as indicated in Table 15. \n\n\nIn a preferred VEGF-binding molecule VHH a) i. has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 18 and VHH b) i. has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 64. \n\n\nIn other preferred VEGF-binding molecules VHHs according to a) ii. are selected from VHHs having an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID \n\n\nNOs: 47 - 57 and VHHs according to b) ii. are selected from VHHs having an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 125 - 127 . \n\n\nParticularly preferred is a biparatopic VEGF-binding molecule comprising two VHHs, one of them having the amino acid shown in SEQ ID NO: 57 and one of them having the amino acid shown in SEQ ID NO: 127. \n\n\nThe VEGF-binding molecules with improved properties in view of therapeutic application, e.g. enhanced affinity or decreased immunogenicity, may be obtained from individual VEGF-binding molecules of the invention by techniques known in the art, such as affinity maturation (for example, starting from synthetic, random or naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences), CDR grafting, humanizing, combining fragments derived from different immunoglobulin sequences, PCR assembly using overlapping primers, and similar techniques for engineering immunoglobulin sequences well known to the skilled person; or any suitable combination of any of the foregoing, also termed \"sequence optimization\", as described herein. Reference is, for example, made to standard handbooks, as well as to the further description and Examples. \n\n\n If appropriate, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention with increased affinity may be obtained by affinity-maturation of another VEGF-binding molecule, the \n\n latter representing, with respect to the affinity-matured molecule, the \"parent\" VEGF-binding molecule. \n\n\nImmunoglobulin single variable domains, e.g. VHHs and domain antibodies, according to the preferred embodiments of the invention, have a number of unique structural characteristics and functional properties which makes them highly advantageous for use in therapy as functional antigen-binding molecules. In particular, and without being limited thereto, VHH domains (which have been \"designed\" by nature to functionally bind to an antigen without pairing with a light chain variable domain) can function as single, relatively small, functional antigen-binding structural units. \n\n\nDue to their unique properties, immunoglobulin single variable domains, as defined herein, like VHHs or VHs (or VLs) - either alone or as part of a larger polypeptide, e.g. a biparatopic molecule - offer a number of significant advantages: \n\n\n• only a single domain is required to bind an antigen with high affinity and with high selectivity, so that there is no need to have two separate domains present, nor to assure that these two domains are present in the right spacial conformation and configuration (i.e. through the use of especially designed linkers, as with scFv's); \n\n\n• immunoglobulin single variable domains can be expressed from a single nucleic acid molecule and do not require any post-translational modification (like glycosylation; immunoglobulin single variable domains can easily be engineered into multivalent and multispecific formats (as further discussed herein); \n\n immunoglobulin single variable domains have high specificity and affinity for their target, low inherent toxicity and can be administered via alternative routes than infusion or injection; immunoglobulin single variable domains are highly stable to heat, pH, proteases and other denaturing agents or conditions and, thus, may be prepared, stored or transported without the use of refrigeration equipments; immunoglobulin single variable domains are easy and relatively inexpensive to prepare, both on small scale and on a manufacturing scale. For example, immunoglobulin single variable domains can be produced using microbial fermentation (e.g. as further described below) and do not require the use of mammalian expression systems, as with for example conventional antibodies; immunoglobulin single variable domains are relatively small \n\n\n(approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) compared to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, and therefore show high(er) penetration into tissues (including but not limited to solid tumors and other dense tissues) and can be administered in higher doses than such conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof; \n\n\nVHHs have specific so-called \"cavity-binding properties\" (inter alia due to their extended CDR3 loop, compared to VH domains from 4-chain antibodies) and can therefore also access targets and epitopes not accessible to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof; \n\n\nVHHs have the particular advantage that they are highly soluble and very stable and do not have a tendency to aggregate (as with the \n\n mouse-derived antigen-binding domains described by Ward et al., Nature 341 : 544-546 (1989)). \n\n\nThe immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention are not limited with respect to a specific biological source from which they have been obtained or to a specific method of preparation. For example, obtaining VHHs may include the following steps: \n\n\n(1 ) isolating the VHH domain of a naturally occurring heavy chain antibody; or screening a library comprising heavy chain antibodies or VHHs and isolating VHHs therefrom; \n\n\n(2) expressing a nucleic acid molecule encoding a VHH with the naturally occurring sequence; \n\n\n(3) \"humanizing\" (as described herein) a VHH, optionally after affinity maturation, with a naturally occurring sequence or expressing a nucleic acid encoding such humanized VHH; \n\n\n(4) \"camelizing\" (as described below) a immunoglobulin single variable heavy domain from a naturally occurring antibody from an animal species, in particular a species of mammal, such as from a human being, or expressing a nucleic acid molecule encoding such camelized domain; \n\n\n(5) \"camelizing\" a VH, or expressing a nucleic acid molecule encoding such a camelized VH; \n\n\n(6) using techniques for preparing synthetically or semi-synthetically proteins, polypeptides or other amino acid sequences; \n\n\n(7) preparing a nucleic acid molecule encoding a VHH domain using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis, followed by expression of the nucleic acid thus obtained; \n\n (8) subjecting heavy chain antibodies or VHHs to affinity maturation, to mutagenesis (e.g. random mutagenesis or site-directed mutagenesis) and/or any other technique(s) in order to increase the affinity and/or specificity of the VHH; and/or \n\n\n(9) combinations or selections of the foregoing steps. \n\n\nSuitable methods and techniques for performing the above-described steps are known in the art and will be clear to the skilled person. By way of example, methods of obtaining VHH domains binding to a specific antigen or epitope have been described in WO2006/040153 and WO2006/122786. \n\n\nAccording to specific embodiments, the immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention or present in the polypeptides of the invention are VHH domains with an amino acid sequence that essentially corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring VHH domain, but that has been \"humanized\" or \"sequence-optimized\" (optionally after affinity-maturation), i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said naturally occurring VHH sequence by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a variable heavy domain of a conventional 4-chain antibody from a human being. This can be performed using methods known in the art, which can by routinely used by the skilled person. \n\n\nA humanized VHH domain may contain one or more fully human framework region sequences, and, in an even more specific embodiment, may contain human framework region sequences derived from the human germline Vh3 sequences DP-29, DP-47, DP-51 , or parts thereof, or be highly homologous thereto, optionally combined with JH sequences, such as JH5. Thus, a humanization protocol may comprise the replacement of any of the VHH residues with the corresponding framework 1 , 2 and 3 (FRI, FR2 and FR3) \n\n residues of germline VH genes such as DP 47, DP 29 and DP 51 ) either alone or in combination. Suitable framework regions (FR) of the immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention can be selected from those as set out e.g. in WO 2006/004678 and specifically, include the so-called \"KERE\" and \"GLEW\" classes. Examples are immunoglobulin single variable domains having the amino acid sequence G-L-E-W at about positions 44 to 47, and their respective humanized counterparts. A humanized VHH domain may contain one or more fully human framework region sequences. \n\n\nIn VHHs of the invention that start with EVQ, the N-terminal E may be replaced by a D (which is often a result of sequence-optimization) or it may be missing (as for expression of the VHH in E.coli). For formatted VEGF-binding molecules, this usually applies only to the VHH that is situated N-terminally. \n\n\nA preferred, but non-limiting humanizing substitution for VHH domains belonging to the 103 P,R,S-group and/or the GLEW-group (as defined below) is 108Q to 108L. Methods for humanizing immunoglobulin single variable domains are known in the art. \n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the immunoglobulin single variable domain is a domain antibody, as defined herein. \n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the representatives of the class of VEGF-binding immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention have amino acid sequences that correspond to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring VH domain that has been \"camelized\", i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring variable heavy chain from a conventional 4-chain antibody by one or more amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a VHH domain of a heavy chain antibody. This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, and reference is additionally \n\n be made to WO 94/04678. Such camelization may preferentially occur at amino acid positions which are present at the VH-VL interface and at the so-called Camelidae Hallmark residues (see for example also WO 94/04678). A detained description of such \"humanization\" and \"camelization\" techniques and preferred framework region sequences consistent therewith can additionally be taken from e.g. pp. 46 and pp. 98 of WO 2006/040153 and pp. 107 of WO 2006/122786. \n\n\nThe VEGF-binding molecules of the invention, e.g. immunoglobulin single variable domains, have specificity for VEGF in that they comprise one or more immunoglobulin single variable domains specifically binding to one or more epitopes within the VEGF molecule. \n\n\nSpecific binding of an VEGF-binding molecule to its antigen VEGF can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, the assays described herein, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA and ELISA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art. \n\n\nWith regard to the antigen VEGF, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention, e.g. an immunoglobulin single variable domain, is not limited with regard to the species. Thus, the immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention preferably bind to human VEGF, if intended for therapeutic purposes in humans. However, immunoglobulin single variable domains that bind to VEGF from another mammalian species are also within the scope of the invention. An immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention binding to one species form of VEGF may cross-react with VEGF, which has a different sequence than the human one, from one or more other species. For example, immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention binding to human VEGF may exhibit cross reactivity with VEGF from one or more other species \n\n of primates and/or with VEGF from one or more species of animals that are used in animal models for diseases, for example monkey, mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, dog, and in particular in animal models for diseases and disorders associated with VEGF-mediated effects on angiogenesis (such as the species and animal models mentioned herein). Immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention that show such cross-reactivity are advantageous in a research and/or drug development, since it allows the immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention to be tested in acknowledged disease models such as monkeys, in particular Cynomolgus or Rhesus, or mice and rats. \n\n\nPreferably, in view of cross-reactivity with one or more VEGF molecules from species other than human that is/are intended for use as an animal model during development of a therapeutic VEGF antagonist, a VEGF-binding molecule recognizes an epitope in a region of the VEGF of interest that has a high degree of identity with human VEGF. \n\n\nAn immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention recognizes an epitope which is, totally or in part, located in a region of VEGF that is relevant for binding to its receptor, in particular to VEGFR-2, which has been shown to be the receptor whose activation is causally involved in the neovascularisation of tumors. According to preferred aspects, immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention block VEGF receptor activation, in particular \n\n\nVEGFR-2 activation, at least partially, preferably substantially and most preferably totally. \n\n\nAs described above, the ability of a VEGF-binding molecule to block the interaction between VEGF and its receptors, in particular the VEGFR-2, can be determined by an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (AlphaScreen\n®\n), a competition ELISA, or a plasmon resonance (SPR) based assay (Biacore\n®\n), as described in the Examples. \n\n Preferably, an immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention binds to VEGF with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM (as determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis, as described in Example 5.7). \n\n\n Preferably, the immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention have IC50 values, as measured in a competition ELISA assay as described in Example 5.1. in the range of 10\n\"6\n to 10\n\"10\n moles/litre or less, more preferably in the range of 10\n\"8\n to 10\n\"10\n moles/litre or less and even more preferably in the range of 10\n\"9\n to 10\n\"10\n moles/litre or less. \n\n\nAccording to a non-limiting but preferred embodiment of the invention, VEGF- binding immunoglobulin single variable domains of the invention bind to VEGF with an dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n\"5\n to 10\n\"12\n moles/liter (M) or less, and preferably 10\n\"7\n to 10\n\"12\n moles/liter (M) or less and more preferably 10\n\"8\n to 10\n\"12\n moles/liter (M), and/or with an association constant (K\nA\n) of at least 10\n7\n M\n\"1\n, preferably at least 10\n8\n M\n\"1\n, more preferably at least 10\n9\n M\n\"1\n, such as at least 10\n12\n M\n\"1\n; and in particular with a K\nD\n less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. The K\nD\n and K\nA\n values of the immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention against VEGF can be determined. \n\n\nBiparatopic VEGF-binding molecules comprising two or more immunoglobulin single variable domains essentially consist of or comprise (i) a first \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domain specifically binding to a first epitope of VEGF and (ii) a second immunoglobulin single variable domain specifically binding to a second epitope of VEGF, wherein the first epitope of VEGF and the second epitope of VEGF are not identical epitopes. In other words, such polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consist of two or more immunoglobulin single variable domains that are directed against at least two non-overlapping epitopes present in VEGF, wherein said immunoglobulin \n\n single variable domains are linked to each other in such a way that they are capable of simultaneously binding VEGF. In this sense, the polypeptide of the invention can also be regarded as a \"bivalent\" or \"multivalent\" immunoglobulin construct, and especially as a \"multivalent immunoglobulin single variable domain construct\", in that the polypeptide contains at least two binding sites for VEGF. (Such constructs are also termed \"formatted\" VEGF binding molecules, e.g. \"formatted\" VHHs). \n\n\nSuch VEGF-binding molecule of the invention includes (at least) two anti- VEGF immunoglobulin single variable domains, wherein (the) two \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domains are preferably directed against non- overlapping epitopes within the VEGF molecule. Thus, these two \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domains will have a different antigen specificity and therefore different CDR sequences. For this reason, such polypeptides of the invention will herein also be named \"biparatopic polypeptides\", or \n\n\n\"biparatopic domain antibody constructs\" (if the immunoglobulin single variable domains consist or essentially consist of domain antibodies), or \"biparatopic VHH constructs\" (if the immunoglobulin single variable domains consist or essentially consist of VHHs), respectively, as the two immunoglobulin single variable domains will include two different paratopes. \n\n\nIf a polypeptide of the invention is a biparatopic molecule as defined herein, at least one of the immunoglobulin single variable domain components binds to an epitope such that the interaction between recombinant human VEGF and recombinant humen VEGFR-2 is blocked at an inhibition rate of >80%. As has been shown in experiments of the invention, certain formatted molecules contain two VHHs that both block the VEGFR2 receptor at an inhibition rate of >80%. Certain VHHs of the invention block the VEGFR-2 at an inhibition rate of 100%, i.e. they are complete blockers. \n\n In both cases, additional sequences and moieties may be present within the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention, e.g. N-terminally, C-terminally, or located between the two immunoglobulin single variable domains, e.g. linker sequences and sequences providing for effector functions, as set out in more detail herein. \n\n\nAccording to another, albeit less preferred embodiment, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may include more than two anti-VEGF \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domains, i.e. three, four or even more anti- VEGF VHHs. In this case, at least two of the anti-VEGF immunoglobulin single variable domains are directed against non-overlapping epitopes within the VEGF molecule, wherein any further immunoglobulin single variable domain may bind to any of the two non-overlapping epitopes and/or a further epitope present in the VEGF molecule. \n\n\nAccording to the invention, the two or more immunoglobulin single variable domains can be, independently of each other, VHHs or domain antibodies, and/or any other sort of immunoglobulin single variable domains, such as VL domains, as defined herein, provided that these immunoglobulin single variable domains will bind the antigen, i.e. VEGF. \n\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the first and the second immunoglobulin single variable domains essentially consist of either VHH sequences or domain antibody sequences, as defined herein. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the first and the second immunoglobulin single variable domains essentially consist of VHH sequences. \n\n\nAccording to certain embodiments of the invention, the at least two \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domains present in a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention can be connected with each other directly (i.e. without use of a linker) or via a linker. The linker is preferably a linker peptide and will be \n\n selected so as to allow binding of the at least two different immunoglobulin single variable domains to each of their at least two non-overlapping epitopes of VEGF, either within one and the same VEGF molecule, or within two different molecules. \n\n\nSuitable linkers will inter alia depend on the epitopes and, specifically, the distance between the epitopes on VEGF to which the immunoglobulin single variable domains bind, and will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein, optionally after some limited degree of routine \n\n\nexperimentation. \n\n\nAlso, when the two or more immunoglobulin single variable domains that bind to VEGF are VHHs or domain antibodies, they may be linked to each other via a third VHH or antibody, respectively (in such VEGF-binding molecules, the two or more immunoglobulin single variable domains may be linked directly to said third immunoglobulin single variable domain or via suitable linkers). Such a third VHH or domain antibody may for example be a VHH or domain antibody that provides for an increased half-life. For example, the latter VHH or domain antibody may be a domain antibody or VHH that is capable of binding to a (human) serum protein such as (human) serum albumin or (human) transferrin. \n\n\nAlternatively, the two or more immunoglobulin single variable domains that bind to VEGF may be linked in series (either directly or via a suitable linker) and the third VHH or domain antibody (which may provide for increased half- life) may be connected directly or via a linker to one of these two or more aforementioned immunoglobulin sequences. \n\n\nSuitable linkers are described herein in connection with specific polypeptides of the invention and may - for example and without limitation - comprise an amino acid sequence, which amino acid sequence preferably has a length of 9 \n\n or more amino acids, more preferably at least 17 amino acids, such as about 20 to 40 amino acids. However, the upper limit is not critical but is chosen for reasons of convenience regarding e.g. biopharmaceutical production of such polypeptides. \n\n\nThe linker sequence may be a naturally occurring sequence or a non-naturally occurring sequence. If used for therapeutic purposes, the linker is preferably non-immunogenic in the subject to which the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention is administered. \n\n\nOne useful group of linker sequences are linkers derived from the hinge region of heavy chain antibodies as described in WO96/34103 and WO94/04678. \n\n\nOther examples are poly-alanine linker sequences such as Ala- Ala- Ala. \n\n\nFurther preferred examples of linker sequences are Gly/Ser linkers of different length such as (gly\nx\nser\ny\n)\nz\n linkers, including (gly\n4\nser)\n3\n, (gly\n4\nser)\n4\n, (gly\n4\nser), (gly\n3\nser), gly\n3\n, and (gly\n3\nser\n2\n)\n3\n. \n\n\nSome non-limiting examples of linkers are contained in VEGF-binding molecules of the invention shown in Table 15 (SEQ ID NOs 128 - 168), e.g. the linkers \n\n\nGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (35GS; SEQ ID NO: 169); \n\n\nGGGGSGGGS (9GS; SEQ ID NO: 170); \n\n\nGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (40GS; SEQ ID NO: 171 ). \n\n\nIf a formatted VEGF-binding molecule of the invention is modified by the attachment of a polymer, for example of a polyethylene glycol PEG \n\n\n(polyethylene glycol) moiety, the linker sequence preferably includes an amino \n\n acid residue, such as a cysteine or a lysine, allowing such modification, e.g. PEGylation, in the linker region. \n\n\nExamples of linkers useful for for PEGylation are: \n\n\nGGGGCGGGS (\"GS9,C5\", SEQ ID NO: 172); \n\n\nGGGGCGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (\"GS25,C5, SEQ ID NO:173) \n\n\nGGGSGGGGSGGGGCGGGGSGGGGSGGG (\"GS27,C14\", SEQ ID NO: 174), \n\n\nGGGGSGGGGSGGGGCGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (\"GS35,C15\", SEQ ID NO:175), and \n\n\nGGGGCGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (\"GS35,C5\", SEQ ID NO:176). \n\n\nFurthermore, the linker may also be a poly(ethylene glycol) moiety, as shown in e.g. WO2004/081026. \n\n\nIn another embodiment, the at least two VEGF-binding immunoglobulin single variable domains are linked to each other via another moiety (optionally via one or two linkers), such as another polypeptide which, in a preferred but non- limiting embodiment, may be a further immunoglobulin single variable domain as described above. Such moiety may either be essentially inactive or may have a biological effect such as improving the desired properties of the polypeptide or may confer one or more additional desired properties to the polypeptide. For example, and without limitation, the moiety may improve the half-life of the protein or polypeptide, and/or may reduce its immunogenicity or improve any other desired property. \n\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention includes, especially when intended for use or used as a therapeutic agent, a moiety which extends the half-life of the polypeptide of the invention in \n\n serum or other body fluids of a patient. The term \"half-life\" is defined as the time it takes for the serum concentration of the (modified) polypeptide to reduce by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the polypeptide and/or clearance and/or sequestration by natural mechanisms. \n\n\nMore specifically, such half-life extending moiety can be covalently linked to or fused to an immunoglobulin single variable domain and may be, without limitation, an Fc portion, an albumin moiety, a fragment of an albumin moiety, an albumin binding moiety, such as an anti-albumin immunoglobulin single variable domain, a transferrin binding moiety, such as an anti-transferrin immunoglobulin single variable domain, a polyoxyalkylene molecule, such as a polyethylene glycol molecule, an albumin binding peptide or a hydroxyethyl starch (HES) derivative. \n\n\nIn another embodiment, the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention comprises a moiety which binds to an antigen found in blood, such as serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, fibrinogen or transferrin, thereby conferring an increased half-life in vivo to the resulting polypeptide of the invention. According to a specifically preferred embodiment, such moiety is an albumin-binding immunoglobulin and, especially preferred, an albumin-binding immunoglobulin single variable domain such as an albumin-binding VHH domain. \n\n\nIf intended for use in humans, such albumin-binding immunoglobulin single variable domain preferably binds to human serum albumin and preferably is a humanized albumin-binding VHH domain. \n\n\nImmunoglobulin single variable domains binding to human serum albumin are known in the art and are described in further detail in e.g. WO2006/122786. Specifically, useful albumin binding VHHs are ALB 1 and its humanized \n\n counterpart, ALB 8 (WO2009/095489). Other albumin binding VHH domains mentioned in the above patent publication may, however, be used as well. \n\n\nA specifically useful albumin binding VHH domain is ALB8 which consists of or contains the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 177. \n\n\nAccording to a further embodiment of the invention, the two immunoglobulin single variable domains, in preferably VHHs, may be fused to a serum albumin molecule, such as described e.g. in WO01/79271 and WO03/59934. As e.g. described in WO01/79271 , the fusion protein may be obtained by conventional recombinant technology: a DNA molecule coding for serum albumin, or a fragment thereof, is joined to the DNA coding for the VEGF-binding molecule, the obtained construct is inserted into a plasmid suitable for expression in the selected host cell, e.g. a yeast cell like Pichia pastoris or a bacterial cell, and the host cell is then transfected with the fused nucleotide sequence and grown under suitable conditions. The sequence of a useful HSA is shown in SEQ ID NO: 178: \n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, a half-life extending modification of a polypeptide of the invention (such modification also reducing immunogenicity of the polypeptide) comprises attachment of a suitable pharmacologically acceptable polymer, such as straight or branched chain poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or derivatives thereof (such as methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) or mPEG). Generally, any suitable form of PEGylation can be used, such as the \n\n\nPEGylation used in the art for antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to domain antibodies and scFv's); reference is made, for example, to: Chapman, Nat. Biotechnol., 54, 531 -545 (2002); Veronese and Harris, Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54, 453-456 (2003); Harris and Chess, Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2 (2003); and WO2004/060965. \n\n Various reagents for PEGylation of polypeptides are also commercially available, for example from Nektar Therapeutics, USA, or NOF Corporation, Japan, such as the Sunbright® EA Series, SH Series, MA Series, CA Series, and ME Series, such as Sunbright® ME-100MA, Sunbright® ME-200MA, and Sunbright® ME-400MA. \n\n\nPreferably, site-directed PEGylation is used, in particular via a cysteine- residue (see for example Yang et al., Protein Engineering 16, 761 -770 (2003)). For example, for this purpose, PEG may be attached to a cysteine residue that naturally occurs in a polypeptide of the invention, a polypeptide of the invention may be modified so as to suitably introduce one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG, or an amino acid sequence comprising one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG may be fused to the N- and/or C-terminus of a polypeptide of the invention, all using techniques of protein engineering known per se to the skilled person. \n\n\nPreferably, for the polypeptides of the invention, a PEG is used with a molecular weight of more than 5 kDa, such as more than 10 kDa and less than 200 kDa, such as less than 100 kDa; for example in the range of 20 kDa to 80 kDa. \n\n\nWith regard to PEGylation, its should be noted that generally, the invention also encompasses any biparatopic VEGF-binding molecule that has been PEGylated at one or more amino acid positions, preferably in such a way that said PEGylation either (1 ) increases the half-life in vivo; (2) reduces \n\n\nimmunogenicity; (3) provides one or more further beneficial properties known per se for PEGylation; (4) does not essentially affect the affinity of the polypeptide for VEGF (e.g. does not reduce said affinity by more than 50 %, and more preferably not by more than 10%, as determined by a suitable assay described in the art); and/or (4) does not affect any of the other desired properties of the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention. Suitable \n\n PEG-groups and methods for attaching them, either specifically or non- specifically, will be clear to the skilled person. Various reagents for PEGylation of polypeptides are also commercially available, for example from Nektar Therapeutics, USA, or NOF Corporation, Japan, such as the Sunbright® EA Series, SH Series, MA Series, CA Series, and ME Series, such as Sunbright® ME-100MA, Sunbright® ME-200MA, and Sunbright® ME-400MA. \n\n\nAccording to an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, a \n\n\nPEGylated polypeptide of the invention includes one PEG moiety of linear PEG having a molecular weight of 40 kDa or 60 kDa, wherein the PEG moiety is attached to the polypeptide in a linker region and, specifially, at a Cys residue at position 5 of a GS9-linker peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 172, at position 14 of a GS27-linker peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO:174, or at position 15 of a GS35-linker peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO:175, or at position 5 of a 35GS-linker peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 176. \n\n\nA VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be PEGylated with one of the PEG reagents as mentioned above, such as \"Sunbright® ME-400MA\", as shown in the following chemical formula: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to nucleic acid molecules that encode VEGF-binding molecules of the invention. Such nucleic acid molecules will also be referred to herein as \"nucleic acids of the invention\" and may also be in the form of a genetic construct, as defined herein. A nucleic acid of the invention may be genomic DNA, cDNA or synthetic DNA (such as DNA with a codon usage that has been specifically adapted for expression in the intended \n\n host cell or host organism). According to one embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acid of the invention is in essentially isolated form, as defined hereabove. \n\n\nThe nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, may be present in and/or may be part of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid or YAC. The vector may especially be an expression vector, i.e. a vector that can provide for expression of the VEGF-binding molecule in vitro and/or in vivo (i.e. in a suitable host cell, host organism and/or expression system). Such expression vector generally comprises at least one nucleic acid of the invention that is operably linked to one or more suitable regulatory elements, such as promoter(s), enhancer(s), terminator(s), and the like. Such elements and their selection in view of expression of a specific sequence in a specific host are common knowledge of the skilled person. Specific examples of regulatory elements and other elements useful or necessary for expressing VEGF-binding molecules of the invention, such as promoters, enhancers, terminators, integration factors, selection markers, leader sequences, reporter genes, and the like, are disclosed e.g. on pp. 131 to 133 of WO2006/040153. \n\n\nThe nucleic acids of the invention may be prepared or obtained in a manner known perse (e.g. by automated DNA synthesis and/or recombinant DNA technology), based on the information on the amino acid sequences for the polypeptides of the invention given herein, and/or can be isolated from a suitable natural source. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to host cells that express or that are capable of expressing one or more a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention; and/or that contain a nucleic acid of the invention. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, said host cells are bacterial cells; other useful cells are yeast cells, fungal cells or mammalian cells. \n\n Suitable bacterial cells include cells from gram-negative bacterial strains such as strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Pseudomonas, and gram-positive bacterial strains such as strains of Bacillus, Streptomyces, Staphylococcus, and Lactococcus. Suitable fungal cell include cells from species of \n\n\nTrichoderma, Neurospora, and Aspergillus. Suitable yeast cells include cells from species of Saccharomyces (Tor example Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Schizosaccharomyces (for example Schizosaccharomyces pombe), Pichia (for example Pichia pastoris and Pichia methanolica), and Hansenula. \n\n\nSuitable mammalian cells include for example CHO cells, BHK cells, HeLa cells, COS cells, and the like. However, amphibian cells, insect cells, plant cells, and any other cells used in the art for the expression of heterologous proteins can be used as well. \n\n\nThe invention further provides methods of manufacturing a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention, such methods generally comprising the steps of:\n\n\n- culturing host cells comprising a nucleic acid capable of encoding a VEGF- binding molecule under conditions that allow expression of the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention; and \n\n\n - recovering or isolating the polypeptide expressed by the host cells from the culture; and \n\n\n - optionally further purifying and/or modifying and/or formulating the VEGF- binding molecule of the invention. \n\n\nFor production on an industrial scale, preferred host organisms include strains of E. coli, Pichia pastoris, and S. cerevisiae that are suitable for large scale expression, production and fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical expression, production and fermentation. \n\n\nThe choice of the specific expression system depends in part on the requirement for certain post-translational modifications, more specifically \n\n glycosylation. The production of a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention for which glycosylation is desired or required would necessitate the use of mammalian expression hosts that have the ability to glycosylate the expressed protein. In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that the \n\n\nglycosylation pattern obtained (i.e. the kind, number and position of residues attached) will depend on the cell or cell line that is used for the expression. \n\n\nVEGF-binding molecules of the invention may be produced in a cell as set out above either intracellullarly (e.g. in the cytosol, in the periplasma or in inclusion bodies) and then isolated from the host cells and optionally further purified; or they can be produced extracellulahy (e.g. in the medium in which the host cells are cultured) and then isolated from the culture medium and optionally further purified. \n\n\nMethods and reagents used for the recombinant production of polypeptides, such as specific suitable expression vectors, transformation or transfection methods, selection markers, methods of induction of protein expression, culture conditions, and the like, are known in the art. Similarly, protein isolation and purification techniques useful in a method of manufacture of a polypeptide of the invention are well known to the skilled person. \n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention relates to a peptide having an amino acid sequence of a CDR3 contained in an anti-VEGF-VHH having an amino acid sequence selected from sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 9 to 57 or SEQ ID NOs: 58 - 127, respectively, and a nucleic acid molecule encoding same. \n\n\nThese peptides correspond to CDR3s derived from the VHHs of the invention. They, in particular the nucleic acid molecules encoding them, are useful for CDR grafting in order to replace a CDR3 in an immunoglobulin chain, or for insertion into a non-immunoglobulin scaffold, e.g. a protease inhibitor, DNA- binding protein, cytochrome b562, a helix-bundle protein, a disulfide-bridged \n\n peptide, a lipocalin or an anticalin, thus conferring target-binding properties to such scaffold. The method of CDR-grafting is well known in the art and has been widely used, e.g. for humanizing antibodies (which usually comprises grafting the CDRs from a rodent antibody onto the Fv frameworks of a human antibody). \n\n\nIn order to obtain an immunoglobulin or a non-immunoglobulin scaffold containing a CDR3 of the invention, the DNA encoding such molecule may be obtained according to standard methods of molecular biology, e.g. by gene synthesis, by oligonucleotide annealing or by means of overlapping PCR fragments, as e.g. described by Daugherty et al., 1991 , Nucleic Acids \n\n\nResearch, Vol. 19, 9, 2471 - 2476. A method for inserting a VHH CDR3 into a non-immunoglobulin scaffold has been described by Nicaise et al., 2004, Protein Science, 13, 1882 - 1891. \n\n\nThe invention further relates to a product or composition containing or comprising at least one VEGF-binding molecule of the invention and optionally one or more further components of such compositions known per se, i.e. \n\n\ndepending on the intended use of the composition. \n\n\nFor pharmaceutical use, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be formulated as a pharmaceutical preparation or composition comprising at least one VEGF-binding molecule of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient and/or adjuvant, and optionally one or more further pharmaceutically active polypeptides and/or compounds. By means of non-limiting examples, such a formulation may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for parenteral administration (such as by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion), for topical administration, for administration by inhalation, by a skin patch, by an implant, by a suppository, etc. Such suitable administration forms - which may be solid, semi-solid or liquid, depending on the manner of administration - as well as \n\n methods and carriers for use in the preparation thereof, will be clear to the skilled person, and are further described herein. \n\n\nThus, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one VEGF-binding molecule, in particular one \n\n\nimmunoglobulin single variable domain, of the invention and at least one suitable carrier, diluent or excipient (i.e. suitable for pharmaceutical use), and optionally one or more further active substances. \n\n\nThe VEGF-binding molecules of the invention may be formulated and administered in any suitable manner known per se: Reference, in particular for the immunoglobulin single variable domains, is for example made to \n\n\nWO04/041862, WO04/041863, WO04/041865, WO04/041867 and \n\n\nWO08/020079, as well as to the standard handbooks, such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth\n Ed., Mack Publishing Company, USA (1990), Remington, the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21\nth\n Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (2005); or the Handbook of Therapeutic Antibodies (S. Dubel, Ed.), Wiley, Weinheim, 2007 (see for example pages 252-255). \n\n\nFor example, an immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention may be formulated and administered in any manner known per se for conventional antibodies and antibody fragments (including ScFv's and diabodies) and other pharmaceutically active proteins. Such formulations and methods for preparing the same will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include \n\n\npreparations suitable for parenteral administration (for example intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraluminal, intra-arterial or intrathecal administration) or for topical (i.e. transdermal or intradermal) administration. \n\n\nPreparations for parenteral administration may for example be sterile solutions, suspensions, dispersions or emulsions that are suitable for infusion or \n\n injection. Suitable carriers or diluents for such preparations for example include, without limitation, sterile water and pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous buffers and solutions such as physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution; water oils; glycerol; ethanol; glycols such as propylene glycol or as well as mineral oils, animal oils and vegetable oils, for example peanut oil, soybean oil, as well as suitable mixtures thereof. Usually, aqueous solutions or suspensions will be preferred. \n\n\nThus, the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. For oral therapeutic administration, the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 % of the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention. Their percentage in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may \n\n\nconveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained. \n\n\nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain binders, excipients, disintegrating agents, lubricants and sweetening or flavouring agents, for example those mentioned on pages 143-144 of WO08/020079. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may \n\n be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the VEGF- binding molecules of the invention may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. \n\n\nPreparations and formulations for oral administration may also be provided with an enteric coating that will allow the constructs of the invention to resist the gastric environment and pass into the intestines. More generally, preparations and formulations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for delivery into any desired part of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, suitable suppositories may be used for delivery into the \n\n\ngastrointestinal tract. \n\n\nThe VEGF-binding molecules of the invention may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection, as further described on pages 144 and 145 of WO08/020079. \n\n\nFor topical administration of the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid, as further described on page 145 of WO08/020079. \n\n\nGenerally, the concentration of the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1 -25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1 -5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%. \n\n The amount of the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular VEGF-binding molecule selected, but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also, the dosage of the VEGF-binding molecules of the invention varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ. \n\n\nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye. \n\n\nAn administration regimen may include long-term, daily treatment. By \"long- term\" is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein.

The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication. \n\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the invention relates to the use of VEGF- binding molecules, e.g. immunoglobulin single variable domains, for \n\n\ntherapeutic purposes, such as \n\n\n- for the prevention, treatment and/or alleviation of a disorder, disease or condition, especially in a human being, that is associated with VEGF- mediated effects on angiogenesis or that can be prevented, treated or \n\n alleviated by modulating the Notch signaling pathway with a VEGF-binding molecule, \n\n\n- in a method of treatment of a patient in need of such therapy, such method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a \n\n\n pharmaceutically active amount of at least one VEGF-binding molecule of the invention, e.g. an immunoglobulin single variable domain, or a pharmaceutical composition containing same; \n\n\n- for the preparation of a medicament for the prevention, treatment or alleviation of disorders, diseases or conditions associated with VEGF- mediated effects on angiogenesis; \n\n\n- as an active ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition or medicament used for the above purposes. \n\n\nAccording to a specific aspect, said disorder disorder, disease or condition is a cancer or cancerous disease, as defined herein. \n\n\nAccording to another aspect, the disease is an eye disease associated with VEGF-mediated effects on angiogenesis or which can be treated or alleviated by modulating the Notch signaling pathway with a VEGF-binding molecule. \n\n\nDepending on the cancerous disease to be treated, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be used on its own or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, in particular selected from chemotherapeutic agents like DNA damaging agents or therapeutically active compounds that inhibit angiogenesis, signal transduction pathways or mitotic checkpoints in cancer cells. \n\n\nThe additional therapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously with, optionally as a component of the same pharmaceutical preparation, or before or after administration of the VEGF-binding molecule. \n\n In certain embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent may be, without limitation (and in the case of the receptors, including the respective ligands), one or more inhibitors selected from the group of inhibitors of EGFR, VEGFR, HER2-neu, Her3, AuroraA, AuroraB, PLK and PI3 kinase, FGFR, PDGFR, Raf, KSP, PDK1 , PTK2, IGF-R or IR. \n\n\nFurther examples of additional therapeutic agents are inhibitors of CDK, Akt, src/bcr abl, cKit, cMet/HGF, c-Myc, Flt3, HSP90, hedgehog antagonists, inhibitors of JAK/STAT, Mek, mTor, NFkappaB, the proteasome, Rho, an inhibitor of wnt signaling or an inhibitor of the ubiquitination pathway or another inhibitor of the Notch signaling pathway. \n\n\nExamples for Aurora inhibitors are, without limitation, PHA-739358, AZD-1 152, AT 9283, CYC-1 16, R-763, VX-680, VX-667, MLN-8045, PF-3814735. \n\n\nAn example for a PLK inhibitor is GSK-461364. \n\n\nExamples for raf inhibitors are BAY-73-4506 (also a VEGFR inhibitor), \n\n\nPLX 4032, RAF-265 (also in addition a VEGFR inhibitor), sorafenib (also in addition a VEGFR inhibitor), and XL 281 . \n\n\nExamples for KSP inhibitors are ispinesib, ARRY-520, AZD-4877, \n\n\nCK-1 122697, GSK 246053A, GSK-923295, MK-0731 , and SB-743921. \n\n\nExamples for a src and/or bcr-abl inhibitors are dasatinib, AZD-0530, bosutinib, XL 228 (also an IGF-1 R inhibitor), nilotinib (also a PDGFR and cKit inhibitor), imatinib (also a cKit inhibitor), and NS-187. \n\n\nAn example for a PDK1 inhibitor is BX-517. \n\n\nAn example for a Rho inhibitor is BA-210. \n\n Examples for PI3 kinase inhibitors are PX-866, BEZ-235 (also an mTor inhibitor), XL 418 (also an Akt inhibitor), XL-147, and XL 765 (also an mTor inhibitor). \n\n\nExamples for inhibitors of cMet or HGF are XL-184 (also an inhibitor of VEGFR, cKit, Flt3), PF-2341066, MK-2461 , XL-880 (also an inhibitor of VEGFR), MGCD-265 (also an inhibitor of VEGFR, Ron, Tie2), SU-1 1274, PHA-665752, AMG-102, and AV-299. \n\n\nAn example for a c-Myc inhibitor is CX-3543. \n\n\nExamples for Flt3 inhibitors are AC-220 (also an inhibitor of cKit and PDGFR), KW 2449, lestaurtinib (also an inhibitor of VEGFR, PDGFR, PKC), TG-101348 (also an inhibitor of JAK2), XL-999 (also an inhibitor of cKit, FGFR, PDGFR and VEGFR), sunitinib (also an inhibitor of PDGFR, VEGFR and cKit), and tandutinib (also an inhibitor of PDGFR, and cKit). \n\n\nExamples for HSP90 inhibitors are tanespimycin, alvespimycin, IPI-504 and CNF 2024. \n\n\nExamples for JAK/STAT inhibitors are CYT-997 (also interacting with tubulin), TG 101348 (also an inhibitor of Flt3), and XL-019. \n\n\nExamples for Mek inhibitors are ARRY-142886, PD-325901 , AZD-8330, and XL 518. \n\n\nExamples for mTor inhibitors are temsirolimus, AP-23573 (which also acts as a VEGF inhibitor), everolimus (a VEGF inhibitor in addition).

Suitable assays and animal models will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the assays described herein and used in the \n\n\nExamples below, e.g. a proliferation assay. \n\n\nThe data obtained in the experiments of the invention confirm that VEGF- binding molecules of the invention have properties that are superior to those of VEGF-binding molecules of the prior art. Among such properties are complete inhibition of the VEGF165-VEGFR2 interaction and a low IC50, as can e.g. be taken from the ELISA data of Figure 1 and Table 5 as well as the IC\n50\n (nM) values for VHHs in the AlphaScreen assay as shown in Figures 3, 17, 18 and Table 7; and the affinity K\nD\n (nM) of purified VHHs on recombinant human VEGF and mouse VEGF in Table 9, 10 and Figures 5-1 and 5-2. Also, as shown in Table 13, VEGF binders of the invention have high potency, i.e. in the subnanomolar range, in the HUVEC proliferation assay. This indicates that VEGF-binding molecules of the invention are promising candidates to have therapeutic efficacy in diseases and disorders associated with VEGF-mediated effects on angiogenesis, such as cancer. \n\n\nAccording to another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of diagnosing a disease by a) contacting a sample with a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention as defined above, and b) detecting binding of said VEGF-binding molecule to said sample, and \n\n c) comparing the binding detected in step (b) with a standard, wherein a difference in binding relative to said sample is diagnostic of a disease or disorder associated with VEGF-mediated effects on angiogenesis. \n\n\nFor this and other uses, it may be useful to further modify a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention, such as by introduction of a functional group that is one part of a specific binding pair, such as the biotin-(strept)avidin binding pair. Such a functional group may be used to link the VEGF-binding molecule of the invention to another protein, polypeptide or chemical compound that is bound to the other half of the binding pair, i.e. through formation of the binding pair. For example, a VEGF-binding molecule of the invention may be conjugated to biotin, and linked to another protein, polypeptide, compound or carrier conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. For example, such a conjugated VEGF- binding molecule of the invention may be used as a reporter, for example in a diagnostic system where a detectable signal-producing agent is conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. \n\n\nBrief description of the Figures: \n\n\nFigure 1 : Purified monovalent VHHs block the hVEGF165/hVEGFR2-Fc \n\n\n interaction (ELISA) \n\n\nFigure 2: Purified monovalent VHHs block the hVEGF165/hVEGFR1 -Fc \n\n\n interaction (ELISA) \n\n\nFigure 3: Purified monovalent VHHs block the hVEGF165/hVEGFR2-Fc \n\n\n interaction (AlphaScreen) \n\n\nFigure 4: Purified monovalent VHHs block the hVEGF165/hVEGFR1 -Fc \n\n\n interaction (AlphaScreen) \n\n Figures 5-1 and 5-2: Binding of monovalent VHHs to recombinant human and mouse VEGF (ELISA) \n\n\nFigure 6: Binding of monovalent VHHs to human VEGF121 \n\n\n Figure 7-1 through 7-4: Purified VHHs do not bind to VEGFB, VEGFC, \n\n\n VEGFD and PIGF \n\n\nFigure 8-1 and 8-2: Formatted VHHs block hVEGF165/hVEGFR2-Fc \n\n\n interaction (ELISA) \n\n\nFigure 9-1 and 9-2: Formatted VHHs block hVEGF165/hVEGFR1 -Fc \n\n\n interaction (ELISA) \n\n\nFigure 10: Formatted VHHs block hVEGF165/hVEGFR2-Fc interaction \n\n\n (AlphaScreen) \n\n\n Figure 11 formatted VHHs block hVEGF165/hVEGFR1 -Fc interaction \n\n\n (AlphaScreen) \n\n\n Figure 12: Formatted VHHs block mVEGF164/mVEGFR2-Fc interaction \n\n\n (AlphaScreen) \n\n\n Figure 13-1 and 13-2: Formatted VHHs bind to mouse and human VEGF Figure 14-1 through 14-8 formatted VHHs do not bind to VEGFB, VEGFC, \n\n\n VEGFD and PIGF \n\n\nFigure 15: Formatted VHHs bind to VEGF121 \n\n\n Figure 16: Sequence alignment of VHH VEGFBII23B04 with human VH3/JH germline consensus sequence \n\n\nFigure 17: VHH variants of VEGFBII23B04 block hVEGF165/hVEGFR2-Fc interaction (AlphaScreen) \n\n\nFigure 18: Sequence-optimized clones of VEGFBII23B04 block the \n\n\n hVEGFI 65/hVEGFR2-Fc interaction (AlphaScreen) \n\n\nFigure 19: Sequence alignment of VHH VEGFBII5B05 with human VH3/JH germline consensus sequence \n\n Materials and methods: a) Production and functionality testing of VEGF109 \n\n\nA cDNA encoding the receptor binding domain of human vascular endothelial growth factor isoform VEGF165 (GenBank: AAM03108.1 ; AA residues 27 - 135) is cloned into pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, Wl) and overexpressed in E.coli (BL21 Star DE3) as a His-tagged insoluble protein. Expression is induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and allowed to continue for 4 hours at 37°C. Cells are harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication of the cell pellet. Inclusion bodies are isolated by centrifugation. After a washing step with 1 % Triton X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich), proteins are solubilized using 7.5M guanidine hydrochloride and refolded by consecutive rounds of overnight dialysis using buffers with decreasing urea concentrations from 6M till 0M. The refolded protein is purified by ion exchange chromatography using a MonoQ5/50GL (Amersham Biosciences) column followed by gel filtration with a Superdex75 10/300 GL column (Amersheim Biosciences). The purity and homogeneity of the protein is confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Westen blot. In addition, binding activity to VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 and Bevacizumab is monitored by ELISA. To this end, 1 pg/mL of recombinant human VEGF109 is immobilized overnight at 4°C in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 %). Serial dilutions of VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 or Bevacizumab are added to the VEGF109 coated plate and binding is detected using alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate PNPP (p- nitrophenylphosphate) (Sigma-Aldrich). VEGF109 could bind to VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 and Bevacizumab, indicating that the produced VEGF109 is active. \n\n b) KLH conjugation of VEGF165 and functionality testing of KLH- conjugated VEGF165 \n\n\nRecombinant human VEGF165 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is conjugated to mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (mcKLH) using the Imject Immunogen EDC kit with mcKLH (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Efficient conjugation of the polypeptide to mcKLH is confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Functionality of the conjugated protein is checked by ELISA: 2 pg/mL of KLH conjugated VEGF165 is immobilized overnight at 4°C in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 %). Serial dilutions of VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 are added and binding is detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific (Jackson Immuno \n\n\nResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3, 3', 5,5'- tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The KLH conjugated protein could still interact with VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 and Bevacizumab, confirming that the relevant epitopes onVEGF165 are still accessible. \n\n\nExample 1 \n\n\nImmunization with different VEGF formats induces a humoral immune response in llama \n\n\n1.1 Immunizations \n\n\nAfter approval of the Ethical Committee of the faculty of Veterinary Medicine (University Ghent, Belgium), 4 llamas (designated No. 264, 265, 266, 267) are immunized according to standard protocols with 6 intramuscular injections (100 or 50 g/dose at weekly intervals) of recombinant human VEGF109. The first injection at day 0 is formulated in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, Ml, USA), while the subsequent injections are formulated in Incomplete \n\n Freund's Adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, Ml, USA). In addition, four llamas \n\n\n(designated No. 234, 235, 280 and 281 ) are immunized according to the following protocol: 5 intramuscular injections with KLH-conjugated human VEGH165 (100 or 50 g/dose at biweekly intervals) followed by 4 \n\n\nintramuscular injections of human VEGF109 (first dose of 100 g followed 2 weeks later with three 50 g/dose at weekly interval). \n\n\n1.2 Evaluation of VEGF-induced immune responses in llama \n\n\nTo monitor VEGF specific serum titers, an ELISA assay is set up in which 2 pg/mL of recombinant human VEGF165 or VEGF109 is immobilized overnight at 4°C in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 %). After addition of serum dilutions, bound total IgG is detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-llama immunoglobulin (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). For llamas 264, 265, 266 and 267, an additional ELISA is performed in which the isotype- specific responses against VEGF165 and VEGF109 are evaluated. Isotype specific responses are detected using mouse mAbs specifically recognizing conventional llama lgG1 and the heavy-chain only llama lgG2 and lgG3 [Daley et al. (2005). Clin. Diagn. Lab. Imm. 12:380-386] followed by a rabbit anti- mouse-HRP conjugate (DAKO). ELISAs are developed using TMB as chromogenic substrate and absorbance is measured at 450nm. The serum titers for each llama are depicted in Table 1. \n\n Table 1 : Antibody-mediated specific serum response against VEGF165 and VEGF109 \n\n\n ELISA (recombinant protein solid phase coated) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn/d, not determined \n\n Example 2 \n\n\nCloning of the heavy-chain only antibody fragment repertoires and preparation of phage \n\n\nFollowing the final immunogen injection, immune tissues as the source of B-cells that produce the heavy-chain antibodies are collected from the immunized llamas. Typically, two 150-ml blood samples, collected 4 and 8 days after the last antigen injection, and one lymph node biopsy, collected 4 days after the last antigen injection are collected per animal. From the blood samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). From the PBMCs and the lymph node biopsy, total RNA is extracted, which is used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify the VHH encoding DNA segments, as described in WO05/044858. For each immunized llama, a library is constructed by pooling the total RNA isolated from all collected immune tissues of that animal. In short, the PCR- amplified VHH repertoire is cloned via specific restriction sites into a vector designed to facilitate phage display of the VHH library. The vector is derived from pUC1 19 and contains the LacZ promoter, a M13 phage gill protein coding sequence, a resistance gene for ampicillin or carbenicillin, a multiple cloning site and a hybrid glll-pelB leader sequence (pAX050). In frame with the VHH coding sequence, the vector encodes a C-terminal c-myc tag and a His6 tag. Phage are prepared according to standard protocols and stored after filter sterilization at 4°C for further use. \n\n\nExample 3 \n\n\nSelection of VEGF-specific VHHs via phage display \n\n\nVHH phage libraries are used in different selection strategies applying a multiplicity of selection conditions. Variables include i) the VEGF protein format \n\n (rhVEGF165, rhVEGF109 or rmVEGF164), ii) the antigen presentation method (solid phase: directly coated or via a biotin-tag onto Neutravidin-coated plates; solution phase: incubation in solution followed by capturing on Neutravidin- coated plates), iii) the antigen concentration and iv) the elution method (trypsin or competitive elution using VEGFR2). All selections are carried out in \n\n\nMaxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). \n\n\nSelections are performed as follows: Phage libraries are incubated at RT with variable concentrations of VEGF antigen, either in solution or immobilized on a solid support. After 2hrs of incubation and extensive washing, bound phage are eluted. In case trypsin is used for phage elution, the protease activity is immediately neutralized by addition of 0.8 mM protease inhibitor AEBSF. Phage outputs that show enrichment over background are used to infect E. coli. Infected E. coli cells are either used to prepare phage for the next selection round (phage rescue) or plated on agar plates (LB+amp+glucose\n2%\n) for analysis of individual VHH clones. In order to screen a selection output for specific binders, single colonies are picked from the agar plates and grown in 1 ml_ 96-deep-well plates. The lacZ-controlled VHH expression is induced by adding IPTG (0.1 -1 mM final). Periplasmic extracts (in a volume of - 80 μΙ_) are prepared according to standard methods. \n\n\nExample 4 \n\n\nIdentification of VEGF-binding and VEGF receptor-blocking VHHs \n\n\nPeriplasmic extracts are tested for binding to human VEGF165 by ELISA. In brief, 2 pg/mL of recombinant human VEGF165 is immobilized overnight at 4°C in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 %). After addition of typically a 10-fold dilution of the periplasmic extracts, VHH binding is detected using a mouse anti-myc \n\n (Roche) and an anti-mouse-HRP conjugate (DAKO). Clones showing ELISA signals of >3-fold above background are considered as VEGF binding VHHs. \n\n\nIn addition, periplasmic extracts are screened in a human VEGF165/human VEGFR2 AlphaScreen assay (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) to assess the blocking capacity of the VHHs. Human VEGF165 is biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Human VEGFR2/Fc chimera (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is captured using an anti-humanFc VHH which is coupled to acceptor beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, US). To evaluate the neutralizing capacity of the VHHs, periplasmic extracts are diluted 1/25 in PBS buffer containing 0.03 % Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and preincubated with 0.4 nM biotinylated human VEGF165 for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT). To this mixture the acceptor beads (10pg/ml) and 0.4 nM VEGFR2-huFc are added and further incubated for 1 hour at RT in the dark. Subsequently donor beads (10pg/ml) are added followed by incubation of 1 hour at RT in the dark. Fluorescence is measured by reading plates on the Envision Multi label Plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 680 nm and an emission wavelength between 520 nm and 620nm. Periplasmic extract containing irrelevant VHH is used as negative control. Periplasmic extracts containing anti-VEGF165 VHHs which are able to decrease the fluorescence signal with more than 60 % relative to the signal of the negative control are identified as a hit. All hits identified in the AlphaScreen are confirmed in a competition ELISA. To this end, 1 pg/mL of human VEGFR2 chimera (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is coated in a 96-well \n\n\nMaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany).

In brief, recombinant mouse VEGF164 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MS, USA) is coated overnight at 4°C at 1 pg/mL in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 % in PBS). VHHs are applied as dilution \n\n series (concentration range: 500nM - 32pM) in PBS buffer containing 0.1 % casein and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) and binding is detected using a mouse anti-myc (Roche) and an anti-mouse-HRP conjugate (DAKO) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) (Figures 5-1 and 5-2). A mouse VEGF164 reactive mAb is included as positive control. As reference, binding to human VEGF165 is also measured.

Briefly, recombinant human VEGF121 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MS, USA) is coated overnight at 4°C at 1 pg/mL in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 % in PBS). VHHs are applied as dilution series (concentration range: 500nM - 32pM) in PBS buffer containing 0.1 % casein and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) and binding is detected using a mouse anti-myc (Roche) and an anti-mouse-HRP conjugate (DAKO) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) (Figure 6).

In brief, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD and PIGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MS, USA) are coated overnight at 4°C at 1 pg/mL in a 96-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Wells are blocked with a casein solution (1 % in PBS). VHHs are applied as dilution series (concentration range: 500nM - 32pM) and binding is detected using a mouse anti-myc (Roche) and an anti-mouse-AP conjugate (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). As positive controls serial dilutions of the appropriate receptors are taken along and detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Dose-response curves of VHHs and controls are shown in Figures 7-1 through 7-4. The results show that there was no detectable binding of the selected VHHs to VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD or PIGF. \n\n\n5.9 Epitope binning \n\n\nBiacore-based epitope binning experiments are performed to investigate which VEGF binders bind to a similar or overlapping epitope as VEGFBII23B04. To this end, \n\n\nVEGFBII23B04 is immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. For each sample, human \n\n\nVEGF165 is passed over the chip surface and reversibly captured by VEGFBII23B4. Purified VHHs (100 nM) or periplasmic extracts (1/10 diluted) are then injected with a \n\n surface contact time of 240 seconds and a flow rate of 10 uL/minute. Between different samples, the surface is regenerated with regeneration buffer (100 mM HCI). Processed curves are evaluated with Biacore T100 Evaluation software. VHHs could be divided within two groups: group one which gave additional binding to VEGFBII23B04 captured VEGF165 and a second group which is not able to simultaneously bind to \n\n\n VEGFBII23B04 captured VEGF165. Table 12-A summarizes the binding epitopes of the tested VHHs. \n\n\nThe same assay set-up is used to assess whether VEGFR1 , VEGFR2, Ranibizumab and Bevacizumab are able to bind to human VEGF-165 simultaneously with \n\n\n VEGFBII23B04. Table 12-B presents the additional binding responses to \n\n\n VEGFBII23B04-captured VEGF165. Only VEGFR2 is not able to bind to \n\n\n VEGFBII23B04-captured VEGF165, underscoring the blocking capacity of \n\n\n VEGFBII23B04 for the VEGF-VEGFR2 interaction. In addition, these data show that the VEGFBII23B04 epitope is different from the Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab epitope. \n\n\nTable 12-A: Epitope binning of anti-VEGF VHHs - simultaneous binding with \n\n\n VEGFBII23B04 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n * indicating same or overlapping epitopes \n\n Table 12-B: Epitope binning of VEGFBII23B04 - binding of benchmark inhibitors or cognate receptors on VEGFBII23B04 captured VEGF165 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. 10 Characterization of the anti-VEGF VHHs in the HUVEC proliferation assay \n\n\nThe potency of the selected VHHs is evaluated in a proliferation assay.

As shown in Table 26, the formatted VHHs and Bevacizumab inhibit the VEGF induced Erk phosphoryaltion by more than 90%, with IC\n50\ns <1 nM. \n\n\nTable 26: IC\n50\n (nM) values and % inhibition of formatted VHHs in VEGF HUVEC Erk phosphorylation assay \n\n\n \n\n Example 8 \n\n\nSequence optimization \n\n\n8. 1 Sequence optimization of VEGFBII23B04 \n\n\nThe amino acid sequence of VEGFBII23B04 is aligned to the human germline sequence VH3-23/JH5, see Figure 16 (SEQ ID NO: 179) \n\n\nThe alignment shows that VEGFBII23B04 contains 19 framework mutations relative to the reference germline sequence. Non-human residues at positions 14, 16, 23, 24, 41 , 71 , 82, 83 and 108 are selected for substitution with their human germline counterparts. A set of 8 VEGFBII23B04 variants is generated carrying different combinations of human residues at these positions (AA sequences are listed in Table 27). One additional variant is constructed in which the potential isomerization site at position D59S60 (CDR2 region, see Figure 16, indicated as bold italic residues) is removed by introduction of a S60A mutation. \n\n\n\n\n12-0319-pct\n\n\nTable 27: AA sequence of sequence-optimized variants of VHH VEGFBI I23B04 (FR, framework; CDR, \n\n\n complementary determining region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12-0319-pct \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variants are characterized as purified proteins in the VEGF165/VEGFR2 \n\n\nAlphaScreen (Example 5.3, Figure 17). The melting temperature (T\nm\n) of each clone is determined in a thermal shift assay, which is based on the increase in fluorescence signal upon incorporation of Sypro Orange (Invitrogen) (Ericsson et al, Anal. Biochem. 357 (2006), pp289-298). All variants displayed comparable IC\n50\n when compared to VEGFBII23B04 and T\nm\n values which are similar or higher when compared to the parental VEGFBII23B04. Table 28 summarizes the IC\n50\n values and T\nm\n values at pH 7 for the 9 clones tested. \n\n\nTable 28: IC50 (pM) values, % inhibition and melting temperature (@pH 7) of sequence- optimized variants of VEGFBII23B04 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a second cycle, tolerated mutations from the humanization effort (VEGFBII1 1 1 G06) and mutations to avoid potential posttranslational modification at selected sites (the D16G, the S60A substitution and an E1 D mutation) are combined resulting in a sequence-optimized clone derived from VEGFBII23B04: VEGFBII0037. One extra sequence-optimized variant (VEGFBII038) is anticipated which contains the same substitutions as VEGFBII0037, with the exception of the I82M mutation, as this mutation \n\n may be associated with a minor drop in potency. The sequences from both sequence- optimized clones are listed in Table 29. VEGFBI 10037 and VEGFBI 10038 are characterized in the VEGF165/VEGFR2 blocking AlphaScreen (Example 5.3, \n\n\n Figure 18), the melting temperature is determined in the thermal shift assay as described above and the affinity for binding on VEGF165 is determined in Biacore (Example 5.5). An overview of the characteristics of the 2 sequence-optimized VHHs is presented in Table 30. \n\n\nTable 29: AA sequences of sequence-optimized variants of VHH VEGFBI I23B04 \n\n\n \n\n Table 30: IC\n50\n (pM) values, % inhibition, melting temperature (@pH 7) and affinity (pM) of sequence-optimized clones VEGFBII037 and VEGFBII038 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Sequence optimization of VEGFBII5B05 \n\n\nThe amino acid sequence of VEGFBII5B05 is aligned to the human germline sequence VH3-23/JH5, see Figure 19 (SEQ ID:NO: 179 The alignment shows that VEGFBII5B05 contains 15 framework mutations relative to the reference germline sequence. Non- human residues at positions 23, 60, 83, 105, 108 are selected for substitution with their human germline counterparts while the histidine at position 44 is selected for \n\n\n substitution by glutamine. One humanization variant is constructed carrying the \n\n\n 6 described mutations (AA sequence is listed in Table 31 ). \n\n\nTable 31 : AA sequences of sequence-optimized variants of VHH VEGFBII5B05 (FR, framework; CDR, complementary determining region) \n\n\n \n\n One additional variant is constructed in which the potential oxidation site at position M30 (CDR1 region, see Figure 19 indicated as bold italic residue) is removed by introduction of a M30I mutation. Both variants are tested for their ability to bind hVEGFI 65 using the ProteOn. In brief, a GLC ProteOn Sensor chip is coated with human VEGF165. \n\n\n Periplasmic extracts of the variants are diluted 1/10 and injected across the chip coated with human VEGF165. Off-rates are calculated and compared to the off-rates of the parental VEGFBII5B05. Off-rates from the 2 variants are in the same range as the off- rates from the parental VEGFBII5B05 indicating that all mutations are tolerated \n\n\n (Table 32). \n\n\nTable 32: Off-rates sequence-optimized variants VEGFBII5B05 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a second cycle, mutations from the humanization effort and the M30I substitution are combined resulting in a sequence-optimized clone of VEGFBII5B05, designated VEGFBII032. The sequence is listed in Table 33. Affinity of VEGFBII032 is determined by Biacore (see Example 5.5) and the melting temperature is determined in the thermal shift assay as described above. An overview of the characteristics of the sequence- optimized VHH VEGFBII032 is presented in Table 34. \n\n\nTable 33: AA sequence of sequence-optimized clone VEGFBII032 (FR, framework; CDR, complementary determining region) \n\n\n \n\n Table 34: Melting temperature (@pH 7) and affinity (nM) of sequence-optimized clone VEGFBII032 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potency of the sequence-optimized clones VEGFBII037 and VEGFBII038 is evaluated in a proliferation assay. In brief, primary HUVEC cells (Technoclone) are supplement-starved over night and then 4000 cells/well are seeded in quadruplicate in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells are stimulated in the absence or presence of VHHs with 33ng/ml_ VEGF. The proliferation rates are measured by [\n3\nH] Thymidine \n\n\nincorporation on day 4. The results shown in Table 35, demonstrate that the activity (potency and degree of inhibition) of the parental VHH VEGFBII23B04 is conserved in the sequence optimized clone VEGFBII038. \n\n\nTable 35: I C\n50\n (nM) values and % inhibition of the sequence optimized clones VEGFBII037 and VEGFBII038 in VEGF HUVEC proliferation assay"
