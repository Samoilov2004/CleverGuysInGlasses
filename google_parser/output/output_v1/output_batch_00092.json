Description\n\n\n\n\nThis invention relates to pyrazole compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDK), Glycogen Synthase Kinases (GSK) and Aurora kinases to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease states or conditions mediated by the kinases, and to novel compounds having kinase inhibitory or modulating activity. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and novel chemical intermediates.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProtein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) \nThe Protein Kinase Facts Book. I and II\n, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.). The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (e.g., Hanks, S. K., Hunter, T., \nFASEB J, \n9:576-596 (1995); Knighton, et al., \nScience, \n253:407-414 (1991); Hiles, et al., \nCell, \n70:419-429 (1992); Kunz, et al., \nCell, \n73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos, et al., \nEMBO J., \n13:2352-2361 (1994)).\n\n\nProtein kinases may be characterized by their regulation mechanisms. These mechanisms include, for example, autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation by other kinases, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-polynucleotide interactions. An individual protein kinase may be regulated by more than one mechanism.\n\n\nKinases regulate many different cell processes including, but not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation and other signalling processes, by adding phosphate groups to target proteins. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. Phosphorylation of target proteins occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth and differentiation factors, etc.), cell cycle events, environmental or nutritional stresses, etc. The appropriate protein kinase functions in signalling pathways to activate or inactivate (either directly or indirectly), for example, a metabolic enzyme, regulatory protein, receptor, cytoskeletal protein, ion channel or pump, or transcription factor. Uncontrolled signalling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including, for example, inflammation, cancer, allergy/asthma, disease and conditions of the immune system, disease and conditions of the central nervous system, and angiogenesis.\n\n\nCyclin Dependent Kinases\n\n\nThe process of eukaryotic cell division may be broadly divided into a series of sequential phases termed G1, S, G2 and M. Correct progression through the various phases of the cell cycle has been shown to be critically dependent upon the spatial and temporal regulation of a family of proteins known as cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and a diverse set of their cognate protein partners termed cyclins. Cdks are cdc2 (also known as cdk1) homologous serine-threonine kinase proteins that are able to utilise ATP as a substrate in the phosphorylation of diverse polypeptides in a sequence dependent context. Cyclins are a family of proteins characterised by a homology region, containing approximately 100 amino acids, termed the “cyclin box” which is used in binding to, and defining selectivity for, specific cdk partner proteins.\n\n\nModulation of the expression levels, degradation rates, and activation levels of various cdks and cyclins throughout the cell cycle leads to the cyclical formation of a series of cdk/cyclin complexes, in which the cdks are enzymatically active. The formation of these complexes controls passage through discrete cell cycle checkpoints and thereby enables the process of cell division to continue. Failure to satisfy the pre-requisite biochemical criteria at a given cell cycle checkpoint, i.e. failure to form a required cdk/cyclin complex, can lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cellular apoptosis. Aberrant cellular proliferation, as manifested in cancer, can often be attributed to loss of correct cell cycle control. Inhibition of cdk enzymatic activity therefore provides a means by which abnormally dividing cells can have their division arrested and/or be killed. The diversity of cdks, and cdk complexes, and their critical roles in mediating the cell cycle, provides a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic targets selected on the basis of a defined biochemical rationale.\n\n\nProgression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is primarily regulated by cdk2, cdk3, cdk4 and cdk6 via association with members of the D and E type cyclins. The D-type cyclins appear instrumental in enabling passage beyond the G1 restriction point, where as the cdk2/cyclin E complex is key to the transition from the G1 to S phase. Subsequent progression through S phase and entry into G2 is thought to require the cdk2/cyclin A complex. Both mitosis, and the G2 to M phase transition which triggers it, are regulated by complexes of cdk1 and the A and B type cyclins.\n\n\nDuring G1 phase Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and related pocket proteins such as p130, are substrates for cdk(2, 4, & 6)/cyclin complexes. Progression through G1 is in part facilitated by hyperphosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of Rb and p130 by the cdk(4/6)/cyclin-D complexes. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb and p130 causes the release of transcription factors, such as E2F, and thus the expression of genes necessary for progression through G1 and for entry into S-phase, such as the gene for cyclin E. Expression of cyclin E facilitates formation of the cdk2/cyclin E complex which amplifies, or maintains, E2F levels via further phosphorylation of Rb. The cdk2/cyclin E complex also phosphorylates other proteins necessary for DNA replication, such as NPAT, which has been implicated in histone biosynthesis. G1 progression and the G1/S transition are also regulated via the mitogen stimulated Myc pathway, which feeds into the cdk2/cyclin E pathway. Cdk2 is also connected to the p53 mediated DNA damage response pathway via p53 regulation of p21 levels. p21 is a protein inhibitor of cdk2/cyclin E and is thus capable of blocking, or delaying, the G1/S transition. The cdk2/cyclin E complex may thus represent a point at which biochemical stimuli from the Rb, Myc and p53 pathways are to some degree integrated. Cdk2 and/or the cdk2/cyclin E complex therefore represent good targets for therapeutics designed at arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in aberrantly dividing cells.\n\n\nThe exact role of cdk3 in the cell cycle is not clear. As yet no cognate cyclin partner has been identified, but a dominant negative form of cdk3 delayed cells in G1, thereby suggesting that cdk3 has a role in regulating the G1/S transition.\n\n\nAlthough most cdks have been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle there is evidence that certain members of the cdk family are involved in other biochemical processes. This is exemplified by cdk5 which is necessary for correct neuronal development and which has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of several neuronal proteins such as Tau, NUDE-1, synapsin1, DARPP32 and the Munc18/Syntaxin1A complex. Neuronal cdk5 is conventionally activated by binding to the p35/p39 proteins. Cdk5 activity can, however, be deregulated by the binding of p25, a truncated version of p35. Conversion of p35 to p25, and subsequent deregulation of cdk5 activity, can be induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, and β-amyloid peptide. Consequently p25 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, and is therefore of interest as a target for therapeutics directed against these diseases.\n\n\nCdk7 is a nuclear protein that has cdc2 CAK activity and binds to cyclin H. Cdk7 has been identified as component of the TFIIH transcriptional complex which has RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) activity. This has been associated with the regulation of HIV-1 transcription via a Tat-mediated biochemical pathway. Cdk8 binds cyclin C and has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Similarly the cdk9/cyclin-T1 complex (P-TEFb complex) has been implicated in elongation control of RNA polymerase II. PTEF-b is also required for activation of transcription of the HIV-1 genome by the viral transactivator Tat through its interaction with cyclin T1. Cdk7, cdk8, cdk9 and the P-TEFb complex are therefore potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics.\n\n\nAt a molecular level mediation of cdk/cyclin complex activity requires a series of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation, or dephosphorylation, events. Cdk phosphorylation is performed by a group of cdk activating kinases (CAKs) and/or kinases such as wee1, Myt1 and Mik1. Dephosphorylation is performed by phosphatases such as cdc25(a & c), pp 2a, or KAP.\n\n\nCdk/cyclin complex activity may be further regulated by two families of endogenous cellular proteinaceous inhibitors: the Kip/Cip family, or the INK family. The INK proteins specifically bind cdk4 and cdk6. p16\nink4 \n(also known as MTS1) is a potential tumour suppressor gene that is mutated, or deleted, in a large number of primary cancers. The Kip/Cip family contains proteins such as p21\nCiP1,Waf1\n, p27\nKip1 \nand p57\nkip2\n. As discussed previously p21 is induced by p53 and is able to inactivate the cdk2/cyclin(E/A) and cdk4/cyclin(D1/D2/D3) complexes. Atypically low levels of p27 expression have been observed in breast, colon and prostate cancers. Conversely over expression of cyclin E in solid tumours has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Over expression of cyclin D1 has been associated with oesophageal, breast, squamous, and non-small cell lung carcinomas.\n\n\nThe pivotal roles of cdks, and their associated proteins, in co-ordinating and driving the cell cycle in proliferating cells have been outlined above. Some of the biochemical pathways in which cdks play a key role have also been described. The development of monotherapies for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, using therapeutics targeted generically at cdks, or at specific cdks, is therefore potentially highly desirable. Cdk inhibitors could conceivably also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neuro-degenerative diseases, amongst others. Cdk targeted therapeutics may also provide clinical benefits in the treatment of the previously described diseases when used in combination therapy with either existing, or new, therapeutic agents. Cdk targeted anticancer therapies could potentially have advantages over many current antitumour agents as they would not directly interact with DNA and should therefore reduce the risk of secondary tumour development.\n\n\nDiffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL)\n\n\nCell cycle progression is regulated by the combined action of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK-inhibitors (CDKi), which are negative cell cycle regulators. p27KIP1 is a CDKi key in cell cycle regulation, whose degradation is required for G1/S transition. In spite of the absence of p27KIP1 expression in proliferating lymphocytes, some aggressive B-cell lymphomas have been reported to show an anomalous p27KIP1 staining. An abnormally high expression of p27KIP1 was found in lymphomas of this type. Analysis of the clinical relevance of these findings showed that a high level of p27KIP1 expression in this type of tumour is an adverse prognostic marker, in both univariate and multivariate analysis. These results show that there is abnormal p27KIP1 expression in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL), with adverse clinical significance, suggesting that this anomalous p27KIP1 protein may be rendered non-functional through interaction with other cell cycle regulator proteins. (Br. J. Cancer. 1999 July; 80(9):1427-34. p27KIP1 is abnormally expressed in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas and is associated with an adverse clinical outcome. Saez A, Sanchez E, Sanchez-Beato M, Cruz M A, Chacon I, Munoz E, Camacho F I, Martinez-Montero J C, Mollejo M, Garcia J F, Piris M A. Department of Pathology, Virgen de la Salud Hospital, Toledo, Spain.)\n\n\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\n\nB-Cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in the Western hemisphere, with approximately 10,000 new cases diagnosed each year (Parker S L, Tong T, Bolden S, Wingo P A: Cancer statistics, 1997. Ca. Cancer. J. Clin. 47:5, (1997)). Relative to other forms of leukaemia, the overall prognosis of CLL is good, with even the most advanced stage patients having a median survival of 3 years.\n\n\nThe addition of fludarabine as initial therapy for symptomatic CLL patients has led to a higher rate of complete responses (27% v 3%) and duration of progression-free survival (33 v 17 months) as compared with previously used alkylator-based therapies. Although attaining a complete clinical response after therapy is the initial step toward improving survival in CLL, the majority of patients either do not attain complete remission or fail to respond to fludarabine. Furthermore, all patients with CLL treated with fludarabine eventually relapse, making its role as a single agent purely palliative (Rai K R, Peterson B, Elias L, Shepherd L, Hines J, Nelson D, Cheson B, Kolitz J, Schiffer C A: A randomized comparison of fludarabine and chlorambucil for patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A CALGB SWOG, CTG/NCI-C and ECOG Inter-Group Study. Blood 88:141a, 1996 (abstr 552, suppl 1). Therefore, identifying new agents with novel mechanisms of action that complement fludarabine's cytotoxicity and abrogate the resistance induced by intrinsic CLL drug-resistance factors will be necessary if further advances in the therapy of this disease are to be realized.\n\n\nThe most extensively studied, uniformly predictive factor for poor response to therapy and inferior survival in CLL patients is aberrant p53 function, as characterized by point mutations or chromosome 17p13 deletions. Indeed, virtually no responses to either alkylator or purine analog therapy have been documented in multiple single institution case series for those CLL patients with abnormal p53 function. Introduction of a therapeutic agent that has the ability to overcome the drug resistance associated with p53 mutation in CLL would potentially be a major advance for the treatment of the disease.\n\n\nFlavopiridol and CYC 202, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases induce in vitro apoptosis of malignant cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).\n\n\nFlavopiridol exposure results in the stimulation of caspase 3 activity and in caspase-dependent cleavage of p27(kip1), a negative regulator of the cell cycle, which is overexpressed in B-CLL (Blood. 1998 Nov. 15; 92(10):3804-16 Flavopiridol induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via activation of caspase-3 without evidence of bc1-2 modulation or dependence on functional p53. Byrd J C, Shinn C, Waselenko J K, Fuchs E J, Lehman T A, Nguyen P L, Flinn I W, Diehl L F, Sausville E, Grever M R).\n\n\nAurora Kinases\n\n\nRelatively recently, a new family of serine/threonine kinases known as the Aurora kinases has been discovered that are involved in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, and which are important regulators of mitosis.\n\n\nThe precise role of Aurora kinases has yet to be elucidated but that they play a part in mitotic checkpoint control, chromosome dynamics and cytokinesis (Adams et al., \nTrends Cell Biol., \n11: 49-54 (2001). Aurora kinases are located at the centrosomes of interphase cells, at the poles of the bipolar spindle and in the mid-body of the mitotic apparatus.\n\n\nThree members of the Aurora kinase family have been found in mammals so far (E. A. Nigg, \nNat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. \n2: 21-32, (2001)). These are:\n\n\nAurora A (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 2);\n\n\nAurora B (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 1); and\n\n\nAurora C (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 3).\n\n\nThe Aurora kinases have highly homologous catalytic domains but differ considerably in their N-terminal portions (Katayama H, Brinkley W R, Sen S.; The Aurora kinases: role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis; Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003 December; 22(4):451-64).\n\n\nThe substrates of the Aurora kinases A and B have been identified as including a kinesin-like motor protein, spindle apparatus proteins, histone H3 protein, kinetochore protein and the tumour suppressor protein p53.\n\n\nAurora A kinases are believed to be involved in spindle formation and become localised on the centrosome during the early G2 phase where they phosphorylate spindle-associated proteins (Prigent et al., \nCell, \n114: 531-535 (2003). Hirota et al, \nCell, \n114:585-598, (2003) found that cells depleted of Aurora A protein kinase were unable to enter mitosis. Furthermore, it has been found (Adams, 2001) that mutation or disruption of the Aurora A gene in various species leads to mitotic abnormalities, including centrosome separation and maturation defects, spindle aberrations and chromosome segregation defects.\n\n\nThe Aurora kinases are generally expressed at a low level in the majority of normal tissues, the exceptions being tissues with a high proportion of dividing cells such as the thymus and testis. However, elevated levels of Aurora kinases have been found in many human cancers (Giet et al., \nJ. Cell. Sci. \n112: 3591-361, (1999) and Katayama (2003). Furthermore, Aurora A kinase maps to the chromosome 20q13 region that has frequently been found to be amplified in many human cancers.\n\n\nThus, for example, significant Aurora A over-expression has been detected in human breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers (see Zhou et al., \nNat. Genet. \n20: 189-193, (1998), Tanaka et al., \nCancer Res., \n59: 2041-2044, (1999) and Han et al., \ncancer Res., \n62: 2890-2896, (2002).\n\n\nMoreover, Isola, \nAmerican Journal of Pathology \n147, 905-911 (1995) has reported that amplification of the Aurora A locus (20q13) correlates with poor prognosis for patients with node-negative breast cancer.\n\n\nAmplification and/or over-expression of Aurora-A is observed in human bladder cancers and amplification of Aurora-A is associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behaviour, see Sen et al., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst, \n94: 1320-1329 (2002).\n\n\nElevated expression of Aurora-A has been detected in over 50% of colorectal cancers, (see Bischoff et al., \nEMBO J., \n17: 3052-3065, (1998) and Takahashi et al., \nJpn. J. Cancer Res., \n91: 1007-1014 (2000)) ovarian cancers (see Gritsko et al. \nClin. Cancer Res., \n9: 1420-1426 (2003), and gastric tumours Sakakura et al., \nBritish Journal of Cancer, \n84: 824-831 (2001).\n\n\nTanaka et al. \nCancer Research, \n59: 2041-2044 (1999) found evidence of over-expression of Aurora A in 94% of invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast.\n\n\nHigh levels of Aurora A kinase have also been found in renal, cervical, neuroblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate tumour cell lines Bischoff et al. (1998), EMBO J., 17: 3052-3065 (1998); Kimura et al. J. Biol. Chem., 274: 7334-7340 (1999); Zhou et al., Nature Genetics, 20: 189-193 (1998); Li et al., Clin Cancer Res. 9 (3): 991-7 (2003)].\n\n\nAurora-B is highly expressed in multiple human tumour cell lines, including leukemic cells [Katayama et al., Gene 244: 1-7)]. Levels of this enzyme increase as a function of Duke's stage in primary colorectal cancers [Katayama et al., J. Natl Cancer Inst., 91: 1160-1162 (1999)].\n\n\nHigh levels of Aurora-3 (Aurora-C) have been detected in several tumour cell lines, even though this kinase tends to be restricted to germ cells in normal tissues (see Kimura et al. \nJournal of Biological Chemistry, \n274: 7334-7340 (1999)). Over-expression of Aurora-3 in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers has also been reported in the article by Takahashi et al., \nJpn J. Cancer Res. \n91: 1007-1014 (2001)].\n\n\nOther reports of the role of Aurora kinases in proliferative disorders may be found in Bischoff et al., \nTrends in Cell Biology \n9: 454-459 (1999); Giet et al. \nJournal of Cell Science, \n112: 3591-3601 (1999) and Dutertre, et al. \nOncogene, \n21: 6175-6183 (2002).\n\n\nRoyce et al report that the expression of the Aurora 2 gene (known as STK15 or BTAK) has been noted in approximately one-fourth of primary breast tumours. (Royce M E, Xia W, Sahin A A, Katayama H, Johnston D A, Hortobagyi G, Sen S, Hung M C; STK15/Aurora-A expression in primary breast tumours is correlated with nuclear grade but not with prognosis; \nCancer. \n2004 Jan. 1; 100(1):12-9).\n\n\nEndometrial carcinoma (EC) comprises at least two types of cancer: endometrioid carcinomas (EECs) are estrogen-related tumours, which are frequently euploid and have a good prognosis. Nonendometrioid carcinomas (NEECs; serous and clear cell forms) are not estrogen related, are frequently aneuploid, and are clinically aggressive. It has also been found that Aurora was amplified in 55.5% of NEECs but not in any EECs (P< or =0.001) (Moreno-Bueno G, Sanchez-Estevez C, Cassia R, Rodriguez-Perales S, Diaz-Uriarte R. Dominguez O, Hardisson D, Andujar M, Prat J, Matias-Guiu X, Cigudosa J C, Palacios \nJ Cancer Res. \n2003 Sep. 15; 63(18):5697-702).\n\n\nReichardt et al (\nOncol Rep. \n2003 September-October; 10(5):1275-9) have reported that quantitative DNA analysis by PCR to search for Aurora amplification in gliomas revealed that five out of 16 tumours (31%) of different WHO grade (1× grade II, 1× grade III, 3× grade IV) showed DNA amplification of the Aurora 2 gene. It was hypothesized that amplification of the Aurora 2 gene may be a non-random genetic alteration in human gliomas playing a role in the genetic pathways of tumourigenesis.\n\n\nResults by Hamada et al (\nBr. J. Haematol. \n2003 May; 121(3):439-47) also suggest that Aurora 2 is an effective candidate to indicate not only disease activity but also tumourigenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Retardation of tumour cell growth resulting from the restriction of this gene's functions could be a therapeutic approach for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\nIn a study by Gritsko et al (\nClin Cancer Res. \n2003 April; 9(4):1420-6)), the kinase activity and protein levels of Aurora A were examined in 92 patients with primary ovarian tumours. In vitro kinase analyses revealed elevated Aurora A kinase activity in 44 cases (48%). Increased Aurora A protein levels were detected in 52 (57%) specimens. High protein levels of Aurora A correlated well with elevated kinase activity.\n\n\nResults obtained by Li et al (\nClin. Cancer Res. \n2003 March; 9(3):991-7) showed that the Aurora A gene is overexpressed in pancreatic tumours and carcinoma cell lines and suggest that overexpression of Aurora A may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.\n\n\nSimilarly, it has been shown that Aurora A gene amplification and associated increased expression of the mitotic kinase it encodes are associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behaviour in human bladder cancer. (\nJ Natl. Cancer Inst. \n2002 Sep. 4; 94(17):1320-9).\n\n\nInvestigation by several groups (Dutertre S, Prigent C., Aurora-A overexpression leads to override of the microtubule-kinetochore attachment checkpoint; \nMol. Interv. \n2003 May; 3(3):127-30 and Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman A R., Aurora-A amplification overrides the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, inducing resistance to Taxol, \nCancer Cell. \n2003 January; 3(1):51-62) suggests that overexpression of Aurora kinase activity is associated with resistance to some current cancer therapies. For example overexpression of Aurora A in mouse embryo fibroblasts can reduce the sensitivity of these cells to the cytotoxic effects of taxane derivatives. Therefore Aurora kinase inhibitors may find particular use in patients who have developed resistance to existing therapies.\n\n\nOn the basis of work carried out to date, it is envisaged that inhibition of Aurora kinases, particularly Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase B, will prove an effective means of arresting tumour development.\n\n\nHarrington et al (\nNat. Med. \n2004 March; 10(3):262-7) have demonstrated that an inhibitor of the Aurora kinases suppresses tumour growth and induces tumour regression in vivo. In the study, the Aurora kinase inhibitor blocked cancer cell proliferation, and also triggered cell death in a range of cancer cell lines including leukaemic, colorectal and breast cell lines. In addition, it has shown potential for the treatment of leukemia by inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. VX-680 potently killed treatment-refractory primary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cells from patients (Andrews, \nOncogene, \n2005, 24, 5005-5015).\n\n\nCancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include breast, bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gliomas and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas. Leukemias particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), B-cell lymphoma (Mantle cell), and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).\n\n\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase\n\n\nGlycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) is a serine-threonine kinase that occurs as two ubiquitously expressed isoforms in humans (GSK3α & beta GSK3β). GSK3 has been implicated as having roles in embryonic development, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell motility and cellular apoptosis. As such GSK3 has been implicated in the progression of disease states such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, motor neuron disease and/or head trauma. Phylogenetically GSK3 is most closely related to the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs).\n\n\nThe consensus peptide substrate sequence recognised by GSK3 is (Ser/Thr)-X-X-X-(pSer/pThr), where X is any amino acid (at positions (n+1), (n+2), (n+3)) and pSer and pThr are phospho-serine and phospho-threonine respectively (n+4). GSK3 phosphorylates the first serine, or threonine, at position (n). Phospho-serine, or phospho-threonine, at the (n+4) position appear necessary for priming GSK3 to give maximal substrate turnover. Phosphorylation of GSK3α at Ser21, or GSK3β at Ser9, leads to inhibition of GSK3. Mutagenesis and peptide competition studies have led to the model that the phosphorylated N-terminus of GSK3 is able to compete with phospho-peptide substrate (S/TXXXpS/pT) via an autoinhibitory mechanism. There are also data suggesting that GSK3α and GSKβ may be subtly regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosines 279 and 216 respectively. Mutation of these residues to a Phe caused a reduction in in vivo kinase activity. The X-ray crystallographic structure of GSK3β has helped to shed light on all aspects of GSK3 activation and regulation.\n\n\nGSK3 forms part of the mammalian insulin response pathway and is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase. Upregulation of glycogen synthase activity, and thereby glycogen synthesis, through inhibition of GSK3, has thus been considered a potential means of combating type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): a condition in which body tissues become resistant to insulin stimulation. The cellular insulin response in liver, adipose, or muscle tissues, is triggered by insulin binding to an extracellular insulin receptor. This causes the phosphorylation, and subsequent recruitment to the plasma membrane, of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Further phosphorylation of the IRS proteins initiates recruitment of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane where it is able to liberate the second messenger phosphatidylinosityl 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This facilitates co-localisation of 3-phosphoinositide-dedependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) to the membrane, where PDK1 activates PKB. PKB is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inhibit, GSK3α and/or GSKβ through phosphorylation of Ser9, or ser21, respectively. The inhibition of GSK3 then triggers upregulation of glycogen synthase activity. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit GSK3 may thus be able to induce cellular responses akin to those seen on insulin stimulation. A further in vivo substrate of GSK3 is the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B is inactivated via phosphorylation and is thus able to suppress protein biosynthesis. Inhibition of GSK3, e.g. by inactivation of the “mammalian target of rapamycin” protein (mTOR), can thus upregulate protein biosynthesis. Finally there is some evidence for regulation of GSK3 activity via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of GSK3 by kinases such as mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAP-K1 or RSK). These data suggest that GSK3 activity may be modulated by mitogenic, insulin and/or amino acid stimuli.\n\n\nIt has also been shown that GSK3β is a key component in the vertebrate Wnt signalling pathway. This biochemical pathway has been shown to be critical for normal embryonic development and regulates cell proliferation in normal tissues. GSK3 becomes inhibited in response to Wnt stimuli. This can lead to the de-phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates such as Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product and β-catenin. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt pathway has been associated with many cancers. Mutations in APC, and/or β-catenin, are common in colorectal cancer and other tumours. β-catenin has also been shown to be of importance in cell adhesion. Thus GSK3 may also modulate cellular adhesion processes to some degree. Apart from the biochemical pathways already described there are also data implicating GSK3 in the regulation of cell division via phosphorylation of cyclin-D1, in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), c-Myc and/or other substrates such as Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFATc), Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1) and the c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB). GSK3 also appears to play a role, albeit tissue specific, in regulating cellular apoptosis. The role of GSK3 in modulating cellular apoptosis, via a pro-apoptotic mechanism, may be of particular relevance to medical conditions in which neuronal apoptosis can occur. Examples of these are head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and motor neuron diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. In vitro it has been shown that GSK3 is able to hyper-phosphorylate the microtubule associated protein Tau. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau disrupts its normal binding to microtubules and may also lead to the formation of intra-cellular Tau filaments. It is believed that the progressive accumulation of these filaments leads to eventual neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Inhibition of Tau phosphorylation, through inhibition of GSK3, may thus provide a means of limiting and/or preventing neurodegenerative effects.\n\n\nPRIOR ART\n\n\nWO 02/34721 from Du Pont discloses a class of indeno [1,2-c]pyrazol-4-ones as inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.\n\n\nWO 01/81348 from Bristol Myers Squibb describes the use of 5-thio-, sulphinyl- and sulphonylpyrazolo[3,4-b]-pyridines as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors.\n\n\nWO 00/62778 also from Bristol Myers Squibb discloses a class of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\n\nWO 01/72745A1 from Cyclacel describes 2-substituted 4-heteroaryl-pyrimidines and their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as inhibitors of cyclin-dependant kinases (cdks) and hence their use in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as cancer, leukaemia, psoriasis and the like.\n\n\nWO 99/21845 from Agouron describes 4-aminothiazole derivatives for inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6.

In one embodiment the cycloalkyl group can be cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl. More preferably R\n1 \nis a cyclopropyl group.\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is to be understood that each general and specific preference, embodiment and example of the groups R\n1 \nmay be combined with each general and specific preference, embodiment and example of the groups R\n2 \nand/or R\n3 \nand/or R\n4 \nand/or R\n5 \nand/or R\n6 \nand/or R\n7 \nand/or R\n8 \nand/or R\n9 \nand/or R\n10 \nand/or R\n11 \nand/or D1 and/or D2 and/or A and/or E and/or X and/or X\na \nand any sub-groups thereof as defined herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, and that all such combinations are embraced by this application.\n\n\nThe various functional groups and substituents making up the compounds of the formula (I) are typically chosen such that the molecular weight of the compound of the formula (I) does not exceed 1000. More usually, the molecular weight of the compound will be less than 750, for example less than 700, or less than 650, or less than 600, or less than 550. More preferably, the molecular weight is less than 525 and, for example, is 500 or less.\n\n\nParticular compounds of the invention are as illustrated in the examples below.\n\n\nOne preferred compound of the invention is 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and salts, solvates and tautomers thereof.\n\n\nSalts, Solvates, Tautomers, Isomers, N-Oxides, Esters, Prodrugs and Isotopes of Compounds of Sub-Groups (A) and (B) of Formula (I) and Sub-Groups and Embodiments Thereof\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms thereof, for example, as discussed below.\n\n\nMany compounds of the formula (I) can exist in the form of salts, for example acid addition salts or, in certain cases salts of organic and inorganic bases such as carboxylate, sulphonate and phosphate salts. All such salts are within the scope of this invention, and references to compounds of the formula (I) include the salt forms of the compounds. As in the preceding sections of this application, all references to Formula (I) shall be taken to refer to formulae (II), (III) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\n\nThe salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in \nPharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use\n, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.\n\n\nAcid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), L-aspartic, benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, (+) camphoric, camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane-1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), α-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, (+)-L-lactic, (±)-DL-lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, (−)-L-malic, malonic, (±)-DL-mandelic, methanesulphonic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-amino-salicylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, (+)-L-tartaric, thiocyanic, p-toluenesulphonic, undecylenic and valeric acids, as well as acylated amino acids and cation exchange resins.\n\n\nThe acid addition salts may also be selected from aspartic (e.g. D-aspartic), carbonic, dodecanoate, isobutyric, laurylsulphonic, mucic, naphthalenesulphonic (e.g. naphthalene-2-sulphonic), toluenesulphonic (e.g. p-toluenesulphonic), and xinafoic acids.\n\n\nOne particular group of salts consists of salts formed from hydrochloric, hydriodic, phosphoric, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, succinic, maleic, malic, isethionic, fumaric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, valeric, acetic, propanoic, butanoic, malonic, glucuronic and lactobionic acids.\n\n\nOne sub-group of salts consists of salts formed from hydrochloric, acetic, adipic, L-aspartic and DL-lactic acids.\n\n\nAnother sub-group of salts consists of the acetate, mesylate, ethanesulphonate, DL-lactate, adipate, D-glucuronate, D-gluconate and hydrochloride salts.\n\n\nSalts such as acid addition salts have a number of advantages over the corresponding free base. For example, the salts will enjoy one or more of the following advantages over the free base in that they will:\n\n \n \n \n \nbe more soluble and hence will be better for i.v. administration (e.g. by infusion) and will have improved pharmacokinetics;\n \nhave better stability (e.g. improved shelf life);\n \nhave better thermal stability;\n \nbe less basic and therefore better for i.v. administration;\n \nhave advantages for production;\n \nhave improved metabolic properties; and\n \nexhibit less clinical variation between patients.\n \n \n \n\n\nPreferred salts for use in the preparation of liquid (e.g. aqueous) compositions of the compounds of formulae (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups and examples thereof as described herein are salts having a solubility in a given liquid carrier (e.g. water) of greater than 25 mg/ml of the liquid carrier (e.g. water), more typically greater than 50 mg/ml and preferably greater than 100 mg/ml.\n\n\nIn another embodiment preferred salts for use in the preparation of liquid (e.g. aqueous) compositions the compounds of formulae (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups and examples thereof as described herein are salts having a solubility in a given liquid carrier (e.g. water or buffer systems) greater than 1 mg/ml, typically greater than 5 mg/ml of the liquid carrier (e.g. water), more typically greater than 15 mg/ml, more typically greater than 20 mg/ml and preferably greater than 25 mg/ml.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the preferred acid addition salts are mesylate, ethanesulphonate, D- or L-lactate, and hydrochloride salts. In one particular embodiment the acid addition salt is the lactate salt, in particular L-lactate or D-lactate, preferably L-lactate.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising an aqueous solution containing a compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups and examples thereof as described herein in the form of a salt in a concentration of greater than 25 mg/ml, typically greater than 50 mg/ml and preferably greater than 100 mg/ml.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising an aqueous solution containing a compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups and examples thereof as described herein in the form of a salt in a concentration of greater than 1 mg/ml, typically greater than 5 mg/ml of the liquid carrier (e.g. water), more typically greater than 15 mg/ml, more typically greater than 20 mg/ml and preferably greater than 25 mg/ml.\n\n\nIf the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., —COOH may be —COO\n−\n), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na\n+\n and K\n+\n, alkaline earth metal cations such as Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n, and other cations such as Al\n3+\n. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH\n4\n \n+\n) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH\n3\nR\n+\n, NH\n2\nR\n2\n \n+\n, NHR\n3\n \n+\n, NR\n4\n \n+\n). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH\n3\n)\n4\n \n+\n.\n\n\nWhere the compounds of the formula (I) contain an amine function, these may form quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary ammonium compounds are within the scope of formula (I).\n\n\nThe salt forms of the compounds of the invention are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, “Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts,” \nJ. Pharm. Sci., Vol. \n66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention.\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) containing an amine function may also form N-oxides. A reference herein to a compound of the formula (I) that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide.\n\n\nWhere a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.\n\n\nN-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry\n, by Jerry March, 4\nth \nEdition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (\nSyn. Comm. \n1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) may exist in a number of different geometric isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula (I) include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula (I).\n\n\nFor example, in compounds of the formula (I) the benzoimidazole group may take either of the following two tautomeric forms A, A′, B and B′. For simplicity, the general formula (I) illustrates forms A and A′ but the formula is to be taken as embracing all four tautomeric forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pyrazole ring may also exhibit tautomerism and can exist in the two tautomeric forms C and D below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther examples of tautomeric forms include, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, and nitro/aci-nitro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere compounds of the formula (I) contain one or more chiral centres, and can exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to compounds of the formula (I) include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures (e.g. racemic mixtures) or two or more optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n\nFor example, the group A can include one or more chiral centres. Thus, when E and R\n1 \nare both attached to the same carbon atom on the linker group A, the said carbon atom is typically chiral and hence the compound of the formula (I) will exist as a pair of enantiomers (or more than one pair of enantiomers where more than one chiral centre is present in the compound).\n\n\nThe optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e. as + and − isomers, or d and l isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute stereochemistry using the “R and S” nomenclature developed by Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, see \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry \nby Jerry March, 4\nth \nEdition, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold & Prelog, \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., \n1966, 5, 385-415.\n\n\nOptical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral chromatography (chromatography on a chiral support) and such techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art.\n\n\nAs an alternative to chiral chromatography, optical isomers can be separated by forming diastereoisomeric salts with chiral acids such as (+)-tartaric acid, (−)-pyroglutamic acid, (−)-di-toluloyl-L-tartaric acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (−)-malic acid, and (−)-camphorsulphonic, separating the diastereoisomers by preferential crystallisation, and then dissociating the salts to give the individual enantiomer of the free base.\n\n\nWhere compounds of the formula (I) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms, one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain circumstances, it may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (I) having one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%) of the compound of the formula (I) is present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment, 99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the formula (I) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer).\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope \n1\nH, \n2\nH (D), and \n3\nH (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively \n12\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC and \n16\nO and \n18\nO.\n\n\nThe isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.\n\n\nEsters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters of the compounds of formula (I) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also embraced by Formula (I). Examples of esters are compounds containing the group —C(═O)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a C\n1-7 \nalkyl group, a C\n3-20 \nheterocyclyl group, or a C\n5-20 \naryl group, preferably a C\n1-7 \nalkyl group. Particular examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, —C(═O)OCH\n3\n, —C(═O)OCH\n2\nCH\n3\n, —C(═O)OC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, and —C(═O)OPh. Examples of acyloxy (reverse ester) groups are represented by —OC(═O)R, wherein R is an acyloxy substituent, for example, a C\n1-7 \nalkyl group, a C\n3-20 \nheterocyclyl group, or a C\n5-20 \naryl group, preferably a C\n1-7 \nalkyl group. Particular examples of acyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, —OC(═O)CH\n3 \n(acetoxy), —OC(═O)CH\n2\nCH\n3\n, —OC(═O)C(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, —OC(═O)Ph, and —OC(═O)CH\n2\nPh.\n\n\nAlso encompassed by formula (I) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds. By “prodrugs” is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the formula (I).\n\n\nFor example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (—C(═O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (—C(═O)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.\n\n\nExamples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula —C(═O)OR wherein R is:\n\n \n \nC\n1-7\nalkyl\n \n(e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);\n \nC\n1-7\n-aminoalkyl\n \n(e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and\n \nacyloxy-C\n1-7\nalkyl\n \n(e.g., acyloxymethyl;\n \nacyloxyethyl;\n \npivaloyloxymethyl;\n \nacetoxymethyl;\n \n1-acetoxyethyl;\n \n1-(1-methoxy-1-methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl;\n \n1-(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;\n \n1-isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;\n \n1-cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;\n \ncyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl;\n \n1-cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl;\n \n(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl;\n \n1-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl;\n \n(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and\n \n1-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).\n \n\n\nAlso, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.\n\n\n1-Cyclolpropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and salts thereof\n\n\nOne particular compound of Formula (I), Sub-Group (A) is 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one preferred embodiment, the invention provides a free base or an acid addition salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea\n\n\nThe free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea from which the salts are derived has the formula (XXX):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compound of the formula (XXX) may be referred to in this application by its chemical name, 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, or, for convenience, as “the compound XXX”, “the compound of formula (XXX)” or the compound of Example 24. Each of these synonyms refers to the compound shown in formula (XXX) above and having the chemical name 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nReferences to the compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base and its acid addition salts include within their scope all solvates, tautomers and isotopes thereof and, where the context admits, N-oxides, other ionic forms and prodrugs. Therefore a reference to the alternative tautomer of formula (XXX), 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(6-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is to be understood to refer to compound (XXX).\n\n\nThe acid addition salt of formula (XXX) may be selected from salts formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), aspartic (e.g. L-aspartic), benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, (+) camphoric (e.g. (+) camphoric), camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, carbonic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecanoate, dodecylsulphuric, ethane-1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), α-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, isobutyric, lactic (e.g. (+)-L-lactic and, (−)-D-lactic), lactobionic, laurylsulphonic, maleic, malic, (−)-L-malic, malonic, (±)-DL-mandelic, methanesulphonic, mucic, naphthalenesulphonic (e.g. naphthalene-2-sulphonic), naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-amino-salicylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, tartaric (e.g. (+)-L-tartaric), thiocyanic, toluenesulphonic (e.g. p-toluenesulphonic), undecylenic and valeric and xinafoic acids, as well as acylated amino acids and cation exchange resins.\n\n\nOne particular group of salts consists of salts formed from hydrochloric, hydriodic, phosphoric, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, succinic, maleic, malic, isethionic, fumaric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, valeric, acetic, propanoic, butanoic, malonic, glucuronic and lactobionic acids.\n\n\nOne sub-group of salts consists of salts formed from hydrochloric, acetic, adipic, L-aspartic and D- or L-lactic acids.\n\n\nAnother sub-group of salts consists of the acetate, mesylate, ethanesulphonate, D- or L-lactate, adipate, D-glucuronate, D-gluconate and hydrochloride salts. In another embodiment the preferred acid addition salts are mesylate, ethanesulphonate, D- or L-lactate, and hydrochloride salts.\n\n\nIn one particular embodiment the acid addition salt is the DL-lactate, in particular the L-lactate or D-lactate, preferably the L-lactate.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the free base or salt of the compound of Formula (XXX) is selected from the L-lactate salt, free base dehydrate, esylate salt, free base and hydrochloride salt.\n\n\nIn a further and preferred embodiment, the salt of the compound of Formula (XXX) is selected from the lactate and citrate salts and mixtures thereof, and more preferably is selected from the L-lactate and citrate salts and mixtures thereof, with the L-lactate salt being particularly preferred. Particular and preferred embodiments of the invention relating to the L-lactate and citrate salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea are set out and described in more detail below.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the compound of Formula (XXX) is a free base.\n\n\nThe salts of the present invention, such as the lactate (e.g. L-lactate) and citrate salts, can be synthesized from the parent compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in \nPharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection, and Use\n, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the parent compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea with the appropriate acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing an acid addition salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, such as the lactate (e.g. L-lactate) and citrate salts, which method comprises forming a solution of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base in a solvent (typically an organic solvent) or mixture of solvents, and treating the solution with an acid to form a precipitate of the acid addition salt.\n\n\nThe acid may be added as a solution in a solvent which is miscible with the solvent in which the free base is dissolved. The solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt thereof is insoluble. Alternatively, the solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt is at least partially soluble, a different solvent in which the acid addition salt is less soluble subsequently being added such that the salt precipitates out of solution.\n\n\nIn an alternative method of forming an acid addition salt, such as the lactate (e.g. L-lactate) and citrate salts, 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is dissolved in a solvent comprising a volatile acid and optionally a co-solvent, thereby to form a solution of the acid addition salt with the volatile acid, and the resulting solution is then concentrated or evaporated to isolate the salt. A further example of an acid addition salt that can be made in this way is the acetate salt.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of forming an acid addition salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as defined herein, such as the lactate (e.g. L-lactate) and citrate salts, which method comprises treating a compound of the formula (XXX):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith an organic or inorganic acid as defined herein in an organic solvent to an acid addition salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea with the organic or inorganic acid, and optionally isolating the acid addition salt thus formed.\n\n\n\nThe salt is typically precipitated from the organic solvent as it is formed and hence can be isolated by separation of the solid from the solution, e.g. by filtration.\n\n\nOne salt form of the invention can be converted to the free base and optionally to another salt form by methods well known to the skilled person. For example, the free base can be formed by passing the salt solution through a column containing an amine stationary phase (e.g. a Strata-NH\n2 \ncolumn). Alternatively, a solution of the salt in water can be treated with sodium bicarbonate to decompose the salt and precipitate out the free base. The free base may then be combined with another acid by one of the methods described above or elsewhere herein.\n\n\nThe preferred salts such as acid addition salts e.g. the lactate (e.g. L-lactate) and citrate salts, have a number of advantages. For example, the salts will enjoy one or more of the following advantages in that they:\n\n \n \n \n \nwill be more soluble in particular they will have improved solubility in aqueous solution and hence will be better for i.v. administration (e.g. by infusion)\n \nwill allow control of solution pH and are therefore better for i.v. administration;\n \nmay have improved anti-cancer activity; and\n \nmay have an improved therapeutic index.\n \n \n \n\n\nFurther advantages of the salts are that they:\n\n \n \n \n \nwill have better stability for example thermal stability (e.g. improved shelf life);\n \nwill have advantages for production; and\n \nwill have better physicochemical properties.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe lactate (e.g. L-lactate) salt of the invention is particularly advantageous as it has good solubility in water, and gives better solubility in buffer systems.\n\n\nPreferred salts for use in the preparation of liquid (e.g. aqueous) pharmaceutical compositions are acid addition salts (such as the lactates) having a solubility in a given liquid carrier (e.g. water) of greater than 1 mg/ml, typically greater than 5 mg/ml of the liquid carrier (e.g. water), more typically greater than 15 mg/ml, more typically greater than 20 mg/ml and preferably greater than 25 mg/ml.\n\n\nAqueous solutions of the salts (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical compositions) represent a further aspect of the invention. Such solutions may be buffered or unbuffered. In solution, the salts will typically dissociate to form 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form together with one or more counter ions. In another aspect, therefore, the invention also provides an aqueous solution of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form together with one or more counter ions and optionally one or more further counter ions (for example counter ions derived from other salts such as sodium chloride or buffering agents).\n\n\nThe salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, “Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts,” \nJ. Pharm. Sci., Vol. \n66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms therefore also form part of the invention.\n\n\nThe compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea may also form N-oxides. N-Oxides can be formed by the methods described above.\n\n\nAs with other compounds of this invention, the compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its acid addition salts may exist in a number of different tautomeric forms and references in this application to the compound include all such forms.\n\n\nMore particularly, in 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its salts, the benzoimidazole group may take either of the two tautomeric forms A″ and B″ identified below. For simplicity, the general formula (I) illustrates forms A″ but the formula is to be taken as embracing all tautomeric forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore references to the alternative tautomer, 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(6-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea are clearly references to the same compound as 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nThe pyrazole ring may also exhibit tautomerism and can exist in the two tautomeric forms C″ and D″ below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition cis and trans conformations of the urea are possible as illustrated below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences to 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its salts also include variants with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope \n1\nH, \n2\nH (D), and \n3\nH (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively \n12\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC and \n16\nO and \n18\nO.\n\n\nThe isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.\n\n\nAlso encompassed by references to 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its salts are any polymorphic forms, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) thereof.\n\n\nLactate and Citrate Salts, Mixtures and Crystals Thereof\n\n\nAs will be apparent from the foregoing sections of the this application, preferred salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea are the acid addition salts formed with lactic acid (more preferably L-lactic acid), citric acid or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nFor convenience the salts formed from lactic acid, L-lactic acid and citric acid may be referred to herein as the lactate, L-lactate and citrate salts respectively.\n\n\nIn one particular embodiment the salt is the L-lactate or D-lactate, preferably L-lactate.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the salt is a salt formed with citric acid.\n\n\nMore particularly the salts are a mixture of the L-lactate salts and citrate salts.\n\n\nIn the solid state, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts of the invention can be crystalline or amorphous or a mixture thereof.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are amorphous.\n\n\nIn an amorphous solid, the three dimensional structure that normally exists in a crystalline form does not exist and the positions of the molecules relative to one another in the amorphous form are essentially random, see for example Hancock et al. \nJ Pharm. Sci\n. (1997), 86, 1).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are substantially crystalline i.e. they may be from 50% to 100% crystalline, and more particularly they may be at least 50% crystalline, or at least 60% crystalline, or at least 70% crystalline, or at least 80% crystalline, or at least 90% crystalline, or at least 95% crystalline, or at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are selected from the group consisting of lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts that are from 50% to 100% crystalline, for example at least 50% crystalline, at least 60% crystalline, at least 70% crystalline, at least 80% crystalline, at least 90% crystalline, at least 95% crystalline, at least 98% crystalline, at least 99% crystalline, at least 99.5% crystalline, and at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\n\n\nMore preferably the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts may be those (or may be selected from the group consisting of those) that are 95% to 100% crystalline, for example at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.6% crystalline or at least 99.7% crystalline or at least 99.8% crystalline or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\n\n\nOne example of a substantially crystalline salt is a crystalline salt formed with L-lactic acid.\n\n\nAnother example of a substantially crystalline salt is a crystalline salt formed with citric acid.\n\n\nThe salts of the invention, in the solid state, can be solvated (e.g. hydrated) or non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the salts are non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).\n\n\nA further example of a non-solvated salt is the crystalline salt formed with lactic acid (particularly the L-lactic acid) as defined herein.\n\n\nThe term “anhydrous” as used herein does not exclude the possibility of the presence of some water on or in the salt (e.g. a crystal of the salt). For example, there may be some water present on the surface of the salt (e.g. salt crystal), or minor amounts within the body of the salt (e.g. crystal). Typically, an anhydrous form contains fewer than 0.4 molecules of water per molecule of compound, and more preferably contains fewer than 0.1 molecules of water per molecule of compound, for example 0 molecules of water.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are solvated. Where the salts are hydrated, they can contain, for example, up to three molecules of water of crystallisation, more usually up to two molecules of water, e.g. one molecule of water or two molecules of water. Non-stoichiometric hydrates may also be formed in which the number of molecules of water present is less than one or is otherwise a non-integer. For example, where there is less than one molecule of water present, there may be for example 0.4, or 0.5, or 0.6, or 0.7, or 0.8, or 0.9 molecules of water present per molecule of compound.\n\n\nOther solvates include alcoholates such as ethanolates and isopropanolates.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the lactic acid salt (particularly the L-lactic acid salt) is solvated for example with water and/or ethanol.\n\n\nThe L-lactate salts and citrate salts can be prepared according to the methods described in the preceding sections of this application and elsewhere herein.\n\n\nThe advantages of the L-lactate and citrate salts include the general advantages set out above in the preceding section of this application. However, the crystalline lactate salt of the invention is particularly advantageous in that it:\n\n \n \n \n \nis non-hygroscopic;\n \nis anhydrous and does not form hydrates;\n \nexists in a single crystalline form and is believed not to exhibit polymorphism\n \nis crystalline;\n \nis stable to storage\n \nhas a sharp melting point and exhibits no form changes in when analysed by DSC;\n \nhas good solubility in water; and\n \ngives better solubility in buffer systems.\n \n \n \n\n\nThus, the L-lactate salt exists in a stable crystalline form that does not form hydrates and does not undergo changes in form under typical handling, processing and storage conditions.\n\n\nThe term ‘stable’ or ‘stability’ as used herein includes chemical stability and solid state (physical) stability. The term ‘chemical stability’ means that the compound can be stored in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no chemical degradation or decomposition. ‘Solid-state stability’ means the compound can be stored in an isolated solid form, or the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no solid-state transformation (e.g. hydration, dehydration, solvatisation, desolvatisation, crystallisation, recrystallisation or solid-state phase transition).\n\n\nThe L-lactate salt and the citrate salt and mixtures thereof have good aqueous solubility and can therefore be used to prepare aqueous solutions containing relatively high concentrations of the salts. Accordingly, in another embodiment, there is provided an aqueous solution (e.g. in the form of a pharmaceutical composition) containing the L-lactate salt or citrate salt or mixtures thereof of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in a concentration of greater than 1 mg/ml, typically greater than 5 mg/ml of the liquid carrier (e.g. water or buffered systems), more typically greater than 15 mg/ml, more typically greater than 20 mg/ml and preferably greater than 25 mg/ml. Within this embodiment, aqueous solutions (e.g. in the form of a pharmaceutical composition) containing (i) the L-lactate salt or (ii) mixtures of the L-lactate and citrate salts are particularly preferred.\n\n\nThe aqueous solutions of the L-lactate salt or citrate salt or mixtures thereof may be presented as aqueous solutions having a pH in the range 2 to 6, for example 2 to 5, and more particularly 4 to 6, such as 4 to 5.\n\n\nThe aqueous solutions of the L-lactate salt or citrate salt or mixtures thereof may be buffered or unbuffered but, in one embodiment, are buffered, for example to a pH in a range as set out above.\n\n\nPreferred buffers are those that are capable of buffering the solution to a pH of approximately 4.5 and which are not volatile under conditions used to lyophilize the solution.\n\n\nIn the context of the salt formed with L-lactic acid, a preferred buffer is a buffer formed from citric acid and corrected with NaOH or HCl to the correct pH, for example at a solution pH of approximately 4.5. At this pH and in the citrate buffer, the free base has a solubility of about 80 mg/ml.\n\n\nAqueous solutions of the L-lactate or citrate salts or mixtures thereof will contain 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form together with L-lactate and/or citrate counter ions. Other counter ions may also be present and these may be derived, for example, from tonicity adjusting agents such as saline (i.e. chloride counter ions) and/or buffering agents such as citrate buffers. For example, where the L-lactate salt is mixed in aqueous solution with a citrate buffer, both L-lactate and citrate counter ions will be present, the nature of the citrate counter ion depending upon the pH of the solution. In addition, aqueous solutions of the L-lactate or citrate salts of mixtures thereof may contain one or more other excipients typically found in I.V. formulations such as tonicity adjusting agents, examples of which are detailed in the United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary and include hexose sugars such as glucose, e.g. dextrose (D-glucose).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, therefore, the invention provides an aqueous solution of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form together with one or more counter ions selected from L-lactate and citrate and mixtures thereof; and optionally (i) one or more further counter ions such as a chloride ions and/or (ii) one or more I.V. excipients such as tonicity adjusting agents (e.g. hexose sugars such as glucose, preferably D-glucose).\n\n\nThe aqueous solutions can be formed inter alia by dissolving a lactate salt in a solution of citrate ions (e.g a citrate buffer) or by dissolving a citrate salt in a solution of lactate ions. The lactate and citrate ions may be present in the solution in a lactate:citrate ratio of from 10:1 or less, for example 10:1 to 1:10, more preferably less then 8:1, or less than 7:1, or less than 6:1, or less than 5:1 or less than 4:1 or less than 3:1 or less than 2:1 or less than 1:1, more particularly from 1:1 to 1:10. In one embodiment, the lactate and citrate ions are present in the solution in a lactate:citrate ratio of from 1:1 to 1:10, for example 1:1 to 1:8, or 1:1 to 1:7 or 1:1 to 1:6 or 1:1 to 1:5, e.g. approximately 1:4.4.\n\n\nEach of the aqueous solutions described in this section of the application and elsewhere herein can be subjected to lyophilisation to provide a solid formulation that can readily be reconstituted to give an aqueous solution (preferably a sterile solution) when required by the addition of water (preferably sterile water) or an aqueous medium containing an I.V. excipient such as saline and/or dextrose.\n\n\nAccordingly, the invention also provides a lyophilized formulation (e.g. in the form of a pharmaceutical composition) comprising the L-lactate salt or citrate salt or mixtures thereof as defined herein, for example wherein the formulation, when dissolved in water, has a pH of 2 to 6, for example 2 to 5, and more particularly 4 to 6 such as 4 to 5.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a lyophilized formulation (e.g. in the form of a pharmaceutical composition) comprising 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form together with one or more counter ions selected from L-lactate and citrate and mixtures thereof, and optionally (i) one or more further counter ions such as a chloride ions and/or (ii) one or more I.V. excipients such as tonicity adjusting agents (e.g. hexose sugars such as glucose, preferably D-glucose).\n\n\nThe ratios of L-lactate to citrate ions in each of the lyophilized formulations may be as set out above in respect of the aqueous solutions.\n\n\nCrystal Structures of 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its Salts\n\n\nAs described above, the lactate (in particular the L-lactate) or citrate salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea can be amorphous or substantially crystalline. In one particular embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are substantially crystalline, the term “substantially crystalline” having the meaning defined above. In particular the lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is substantially crystalline.\n\n\nThe free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea can also be amorphous or substantially crystalline. In one particular embodiment, the free base is substantially crystalline, the term “substantially crystalline” having the meaning defined above. In one embodiment, the free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea exists in a dihydrate crystalline form.\n\n\nThe crystals described herein and the crystal structures form further aspects of the invention.\n\n\nAs indicated above, the lactate salt of the invention is believed to exist in a single crystalline form having the characteristics set out herein. This crystalline form represents a preferred embodiment of the invention. However, in the event that other crystalline forms do exist, these are not excluded from the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nThus, where the lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is substantially crystalline, one single crystalline form (e.g. the crystalline form defined and characterised herein) may predominate, although other crystalline forms may be present in minor and preferably negligible amounts.\n\n\nThe crystalline forms (e.g. the crystalline forms defined and characterised herein) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea (or salts thereof) contain less than or equal to about 5% by weight of other crystalline forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea (or salts thereof), in particular containing less than or equal to about 1% by weight of other crystalline forms (or salts thereof).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a substantially crystalline salt (e.g. a lactate salt such as the L-lactate as defined herein) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea containing a single crystalline form (e.g. the crystalline form defined and characterised herein) of the salt and no more than 5% by weight of any other crystalline forms of the salt.\n\n\nPreferably, the single crystalline form (e.g. the crystalline forms defined and characterised herein) is accompanied by less than 4%, or less than 3%, or less than 2% of other crystalline forms, and in particular contains less than or equal to about 1% by weight of other crystalline forms. More preferably, the single crystalline form (e.g. the crystalline form defined and characterised herein) is accompanied by less than 0.9%, or less than 0.8%, or less than 0.7%, or less than 0.6%, or less than 0.5%, or less than 0.4%, or less than 0.3%, or less than 0.2%, or less than 0.1%, or less than 0.05%, or less than 0.01%, by weight of other crystalline forms, for example 0% by weight of other crystalline forms.\n\n\nThe crystals and their crystal structures can be characterised using a number of techniques including single crystal X-ray crystallography, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infra red spectroscopy, e.g. Fourier Transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The behaviour of the crystals under conditions of varying humidity can be analysed by gravimetric vapour sorption studies and also by XRPD.\n\n\nDetermination of the crystal structure of a compound can be performed by X-ray crystallography which can be carried out according to conventional methods such as those described herein and as described in Fundamentals of Crystallography, C. Giacovazzo, H. L. Monaco, D. Viterbo, F. Scordari, G. Gilli, G. Zanotti and M. Catti, (International Union of Crystallography/Oxford University Press, 1992 ISBN 0-19-855578-4 (p/b), 0-19-85579-2 (h/b)). This technique involves the analysis and interpretation of the X-ray diffraction of single crystal.\n\n\nThe crystal structure of the free base dihydrate and the L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea have been determined by X-ray crystallography—see Examples 69 and 71 respectively below.\n\n\nTables 2 and 4 in Examples 69 and 71 respectively give coordinate data for crystals of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its L-lactate salt in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) Format (see Hall, Allen and Brown, \nActa Cryst\n. (1991). A47, 655-685; http://www.iucr.ac.uk/iucr-top/cif/home.html). Alternative file formats such as a PDB file format (e.g. format consistent with that of the EBI Macromolecular Structure Database (Hinxton, UK)) may be used or preferred by others of skill in the art. However it will be apparent that the use of a different file format to present or manipulate the coordinates of the Tables is within the scope of the present invention. The numbers in brackets in the Tables represents the deviation (s.u., standard uncertainty). The crystal structure of the lactate salt is illustrated in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides the dihydrate free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and (i) has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 2 herein; and/or (ii) wherein the crystals belong to a monclinic space group P2\nl\n/n (#14) with crystal lattice parameters a=7.66(10), b=15.18(10), c=17.71(10) Å, β=98.53(2)°, α=γ=90°.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the invention provides the L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 4 herein.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the invention provides an L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has a crystal structure as set out in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the invention provides an L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has a crystal structure that belongs belong to an orthorhombic space group P2\nl\n2\nl\n2\nl\n, (#19) and has crystal lattice parameters at 97(2) a=9.94(10), b=15.03(10), c=16.18(10) Å, α=β=γ90°.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the invention provides an L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has crystal lattice parameters at room temperature a=10.08(10), b=15.22(10), c=16.22(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°.\n\n\nAccordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides an L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) has a crystal structure as set out in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n; and/or\n \n(b) has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 4 herein; and/or\n \n(c) has crystal lattice parameters at 97(2) K a=9.94(10), b=15.03(10), c=16.18(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°; and/or\n \n(d) has crystal lattice parameters at room temperature a=10.08(10), b=15.22(10), c=16.22(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°; and/or\n \n(e) has a crystal structure that belongs belong to an orthorhombic space group P2\nl\n2\nl\n2\nl\n, (#19).\n \n \n \n\n\nAlternatively, the crystalline structure of a compound can be analysed by the solid state technique of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). XRPD can be carried out according to conventional methods such as those described herein (see Examples 70 and 72) and in Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffraction, Ron Jenkins and Robert L. Snyder (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996). The presence of defined peaks (as opposed to random background noise) in an XRPD diffractogram indicates that the compound has a degree of crystallinity.\n\n\nA compound's X-ray powder pattern is characterised by the diffraction angle (2θ) and interplanar spacing (d) parameters of an X-ray diffraction spectrum. These are related by Bragg's equation, nλ=2d Sin θ, (where n=1; λ=wavelength of the cathode used; d=interplanar spacing; and θ=diffraction angle). Herein, interplanar spacings, diffraction angle and overall pattern are important for identification of crystal in the X-ray powder diffraction, due to the characteristics of the data. The relative intensity should not be strictly interpreted since it may be varied depending on the direction of crystal growth, particle sizes and measurement conditions. In addition, the diffraction angles usually mean ones which coincide in the range of 2θ±0.2°. The peaks mean main peaks and include peaks not larger than medium at diffraction angles other than those stated above.\n\n\nBoth the L-lactate salt and free base forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea have been characterised by XRPD. In each case, the powder X-ray diffraction patterns are expressed in terms of the diffraction angle (2θ), inter planar spacing (d) and/or relative intensities. Tables 3, 5 and 6 in Examples 70 ands 72 show the interplanar spacing (d) values of the X-ray diffraction spectrum that correspond to the diffraction angle values of the free base, L-lactate salt and dihydrate free base forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nTherefore 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its salts have X-ray powder diffraction patterns essentially as shown in \nFIG. 3\n, \n6\n, \n7\n or \n8\n and/or Tables 3, 5 or 6 in Examples 70 and 72.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides crystals of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base or an L-lactate salt thereof exhibiting X-ray powder diffraction patterns containing peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in \nFIG. 3\n, \n6\n, \n7\n or \n8\n and/or Table 3 and/or Table 5 and/or Table 6 and wherein the peaks optionally have the same relative intensity.

Such salts are particularly advantageous for administration in a liquid form, for example by injection or infusion.\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition (e.g. a pharmaceutical composition) comprising an aqueous solution containing a salt as described herein in a concentration of greater than 25 mg/ml, typically greater than 50 mg/ml and preferably greater than 100 mg/ml.\n\n\nSalts of the invention that have a solubility of greater than 25 mg/ml include the D-glucuronate, mesylate, esylate and DL-lactate salts, the latter three of which have solubilities in excess of 100 mg/ml.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one particular embodiment, there is provided a mesylate salt of 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nIn another particular embodiment, there is provided an esylate (ethanesulphonate) salt of 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nIn a further particular embodiment, there is provided a DL lactate salt of 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea. In one embodiment, the lactate salt is the L-lactate.\n\n\nThe free base or parent compound from which the compounds (i.e. acid addition salts) of sub-group (C) of Formula (I) of the invention are derived has the formula (IA):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salts of compound (IA) can be amorphous or crystalline.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the salt is an amorphous form.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the compound is in a crystalline form.\n\n\nThe compound can be non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous) or solvated.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the salts are non-solvated.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the salts are solvated, e.g. hydrated.\n\n\nWhere the compounds are hydrated, they can contain, for example, up to three molecules of water of crystallisation, more usually up to two molecules of water, e.g. one molecule of water or two molecules of water.\n\n\nThe salts of the invention have advantages over the free base form of 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\nFor example, the salts have greater solubility in water and are therefore better for use in preparing parenteral formulations for injection or infusion (e.g. i.v. infusion). Salts of the invention also have one or more other advantages selected from:\n\n \n \n \n \nimproved pharmacokinetics;\n \nbetter stability, for example improved shelf life;\n \nlower basicity making them better for i.v. use;\n \nadvantages for production;\n \nimproved metabolic properties; and\n \nless clinical variation between patients.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe salts may be prepared by any of the methods set out in the preceding section of this application describing salts of compounds of sub-groups (A) and (B) of formula (I).\n\n\nThe compounds of sub-group (C) of formula (I) are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of sub-group (C) of formula (I) may exist in a number of different tautomeric forms and references to the compounds of the invention include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by this application.\n\n\nFor example, in compounds of the invention the benzimidazole group may take either of the following two tautomeric forms A″ and B″ set out above.\n\n\nThe pyrazole ring may also exhibit tautomerism and can exist in the two tautomeric forms C′″ and D′″ below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope \n1\nH, \n2\nH (D), and \n3\nH (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively \n12\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC and \n16\nO and \n18\nO.\n\n\nThe isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.\n\n\nAlso encompassed by the invention are any polymorphic forms of the compounds as well as complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with substances such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds. By “prodrugs” is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the invention.\n\n\nBiological Activity\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention have cyclin dependent kinase inhibiting or modulating activity and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibiting or modulating activity, and/or Aurora kinase inhibiting or modulating activity, and which it is envisaged will be useful in preventing or treating disease states or conditions mediated by the kinases.\n\n\nThus, for example, it is envisaged that the compounds of the invention will be useful in alleviating or reducing the incidence of cancer.\n\n\nMore particularly, the compounds of the formulae (I) and sub-groups thereof are inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases. For example, compounds of the invention have activity against CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6 and CDK7 kinases, and in particular cyclin dependent kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5 and CDK6.\n\n\nPreferred compounds are compounds that inhibit one or more CDK kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK5, for example CDK1 and/or CDK2.\n\n\nIn addition, CDK4, CDK8 and/or CDK9 may be of interest.\n\n\nThe lactate or citrate salts of 1-cyclo-propyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea have activity against CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6 and CDK 9 kinases, and in particular CDK2.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention also have activity against glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3).\n\n\nCompounds of the invention also have activity against Aurora kinases. Preferred compounds of the invention are those having IC\n50 \nvalues of less than 0.1 μM.\n\n\nIn particular, the lactate or citrate salts of 1-cyclo-propyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea are inhibitors of aurora kinase and, for example, inhibit Aurora A and/or Aurora B.\n\n\nMany of the compounds of the invention exhibit selectivity for the Aurora A kinase compared to CDK1 and CDK2 and such compounds represent one preferred embodiment of the invention. For example, many compounds of the invention have IC\n50 \nvalues against Aurora A that are between a tenth and a hundredth of the IC\n50 \nagainst CDK1 and CDK2.\n\n\nAs a consequence of their activity in modulating or inhibiting CDK and Aurora kinases and glycogen synthase kinase, they are expected to be useful in providing a means of arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in abnormally dividing cells. It is therefore anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. It is also envisaged that the compounds of the invention will be useful in treating conditions such as viral infections, type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease for example autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\nOne sub-group of disease states and conditions where it is envisaged that the compounds of the invention will be useful consists of viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\nCDKs play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, differentiation and CNS function. Therefore, CDK inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation such as cancer. In particular RB+ve tumours may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. RB-ve tumours may also be sensitive to CDK inhibitors.\n\n\nExamples of cancers which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma pigmentosum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\n\nThe cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to inhibition of any one or more cyclin dependent kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5 and CDK6, for example, one or more CDK kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK5, e.g. CDK1 and/or CDK2.\n\n\nWhether or not a particular cancer is one which is sensitive to inhibition by a cyclin dependent kinase or an aurora kinase may be determined by means of a cell growth assay as set out in Examples 79 and 80 below or by a method as set out in the section headed “Methods of Diagnosis”.\n\n\nCDKs are also known to play a role in apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and transcription and therefore CDK inhibitors could also be useful in the treatment of the following diseases other than cancer; viral infections, for example herpes virus, pox virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbis virus, adenovirus, HIV, HPV, HCV and HCMV; prevention of AIDS development in HIV-infected individuals; chronic inflammatory diseases, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular diseases for example cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, atherosclerosis; neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atropy and cerebellar degeneration; glomerulonephritis; myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury associated myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfision injury, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, toxin-induced or alcohol related liver diseases, haematological diseases, for example, chronic anemia and aplastic anemia; degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system, for example, osteoporosis and arthritis, aspirin-sensitive rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases and cancer pain.\n\n\nIt has also been discovered that some cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors can be used in combination with other anticancer agents. For example, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has been used with other anticancer agents in combination therapy.\n\n\nThus, in the pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer.\n\n\nOne group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.\n\n\nAnother sub-set of cancers includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer, squamous cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas.\n\n\nIn the case of compounds having activity against Aurora kinase, particular examples of cancers where it is envisaged that the Aurora kinase inhibiting compounds of the invention will be useful include:\n\n\nhuman breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers);\n\n\novarian cancers (e.g. primary ovarian tumours);\n\n\npancreatic cancers;\n\n\nhuman bladder cancers;\n\n\ncolorectal cancers (e.g. primary colorectal cancers);\n\n\ngastric tumours;\n\n\nrenal cancers;\n\n\ncervical cancers:\n\n\nneuroblastomas;\n\n\nmelanomas;\n\n\nlymphomas;\n\n\nprostate cancers;\n\n\nleukemia;\n\n\nnon-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas;\n\n\ngliomas; and\n\n\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\nCancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include breast, bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gliomas and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas.\n\n\nA particular sub-set of cancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors consist of breast, ovarian, colon, liver, gastric and prostate cancers. Another subset of cancers that Aurora inhibitors may be particularly amenable to treat consists of hematological cancers, in particular leukemia. Therefore, in a further embodiment the compounds of formula (I) are used to treat hematological cancers, in particular leukemia. Particular leukemias are selected from Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), B-cell lymphoma (Mantle cell), and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) (alternatively known as acute lymphocytic leukaemia). In one embodiment the leukemias are selected from relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n\n\nOne group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.\n\n\nAnother sub-set of cancers includes hematopoietic tumours of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma).\n\n\nOne particular cancer is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\n\n\nAnother particular cancer is mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\nAnother particular cancer is diffuse large B cell lymphoma.\n\n\nIt is further envisaged that the compounds of the invention, and in particular those compounds having aurora kinase inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of cancers of a type associated with or characterised by the presence of elevated levels of aurora kinases, for example the cancers referred to in this context in the introductory section of this application.\n\n\nThe activity of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases, Aurora kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC\n50 \nvalue. Preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having an IC\n50 \nvalue of less than 1 μM, more preferably less than 0.1 μM.\n\n\nAdvantages of the Compounds of the Invention\n\n\nCompounds of the invention (for example the compounds of Examples 24, 62, 63 and 64) have a number of advantages over prior art compounds. For example, the compounds of the invention (see Table A) demonstrate enhanced selectivity for and potency against Aurora A and B kinases in particular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Aurora kinases in vitro by 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmorpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAurora Kinase\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAurora-A\n\n\n52% at 3 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAurora-B\n\n\n58% at 3 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKinase activities in vitro were determined according to the protocols described in Examples 75 and 76.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are also advantageous over prior art compounds in that they have different susceptibilities to P450 enzymes (see Table B below and Example 81).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of expressed cytochrome P450 isoforms by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbenzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in vitro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP450 isoform\n\n\nIC50 (μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCYP1A2\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCYP2D6\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCYP3A4\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCYP2C9\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCYP2C19\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, compounds of the invention are also advantageous over prior art compounds in that they exhibit improvements with regard to drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties. In particular the compounds of the invention have reduced plasma protein binding. The binding of the compound of Examples 24, 62, 63 and 64 to plasma proteins was comparably moderate across all species tested, ranging from 61% in rat to 82% in mouse plasma. This could confer the advantage of having more free drug available in the systemic circulation to reach the appropriate site of action to exert its therapeutic effect. Increased free fraction to exert pharmacological action in tumours potentially leads to improved efficacy which thereby allows reduced dosages to be administered.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention (for example Examples 24, 62, 63 and 64) also demonstrate improved cell activity in proliferation and clonogenic assays (for example in the assays described in Example 79 and 80) against a wider range of solid tumour cell lines, thereby indicating improved anti-cancer activity (Table C). Data indicates that compound-treatment has different effects on tumour cells compared with normal cells. In checkpoint compromised tumour cells compound treatment leads to multinucleation, due to disruption of mitosis, inhibition of cytokinesis and bypass of the spindle checkpoint through Aurora kinase inhibition. It is this multinucleation that appears to lead to cell death. In contrast, in normal checkpoint competent cells treated with compound, fewer cells become multinucleated or die after 24 h compound treatment, instead the greater proportion undergo reversible G2/M arrest and then re-enter the cell cycle once the compound is removed. These differences in effects could reflect the fact that normal cells have checkpoints in place to halt the cell cycle if accurate chromosomal segregation does not take place, such as the post-mitotic p53-dependent checkpoint. In tumour cells these checkpoints are absent allowing mitosis to proceed and multinucleation to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibitory effect of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea\n\n\n\n\n\n\non tumour cell colony formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\np53 Status*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColon\n\n\nHCT 116\n\n\n13\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHCT 116 N7\n\n\n14\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHT-29\n\n\n11\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSW620\n\n\n14\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOvarian\n\n\nA2780\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung\n\n\nA549\n\n\n12\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBreast\n\n\nMCF7\n\n\n20\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreatic\n\n\nMIA-Pa-Ca-2\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*+ indicates expression of wild type p53; − indicates no expression of p53 or that p53 is non-functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, salt forms of the compounds of the invention demonstrate improved solubility in aqueous solution and better physicochemical properties, e.g. a lower log D.\n\n\nMethods for the Preparation of Compounds of the Formula (I)\n\n\nIn this section, as in all other sections of this application unless the context indicates otherwise, references to Formula (I) also include Formulae (II), (III), (XXX) and all other sub-groups and examples thereof as defined herein.\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person.\n\n\nFor example, compounds of the formula (I) wherein A is a bond (i.e. where A and the carbonyl group form an amide bond), can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula (X):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith a carboxylic acid R\n1\n-E-CO\n2\nH or a reactive derivative thereof under standard amide forming conditions.\n\n\n\nThe coupling reaction between the carboxylic acid and the amine (X) can be carried out in the presence of a reagent of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, \nJ. Amer. Chem Soc. \n1955, 77, 1067), 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) (Sheehan et al, \nJ. Org. Chem., \n1961, 26, 2525), uronium-based coupling agents such as O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (L. A. Carpino, \nJ Amer. Chem. Soc., \n1993, 115, 4397) and phosphonium-based coupling agents such as 1-benzo-triazolyloxytris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniun hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro et al, \nTetrahedron Letters, \n1990, 31, 205). Carbodiimide-based coupling agents are advantageously used in combination with 1-hydroxyazabenzotriazole (HOAt) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Konig et al, \nChem. Ber., \n103, 708, 2024-2034). Preferred coupling reagents include EDC and DCC in combination with HOAt or HOBt.\n\n\nThe coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxane, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, or in an aqueous solvent optionally together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine.\n\n\nAs an alternative, a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, e.g. an anhydride or acid chloride, may be used. Reaction with a reactive derivative such an anhydride is typically accomplished by stirring the amine and anhydride at room temperature in the presence of a base such as pyridine.\n\n\nAmines of the formula (X) can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitro-compound of the formula (XI) under standard conditions. The reduction may be effected, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a polar solvent such as ethanol or dimethylformamide at room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nitro-compounds of the formula (XI) can be prepared by reaction of the nitro-pyrazole carboxylic acid of the formula (XII):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith either 4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-benzene-1,2-diamine (to form compounds where M is D1) or 4,5-dimethoxy-benzene-1,2-diamine (to form compounds wherein M is D2).\n\n\n\nThe reaction between the diamine and the carboxylic acid (XII) can be carried out in the presence of a reagent such as DCC or EDC in the presence of HOBt as described above, under amide coupling conditions as described previously, to give an intermediate ortho-aminophenylamide (not shown) which is then cyclised to form the benzimidazole ring. The final cyclisation step is typically carried out by heating under reflux in the presence of acetic acid.\n\n\nAn illustrative reaction scheme, showing the preparation of compounds of the formula (X) where M is a group D1 is set out in Scheme 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical conditions for each step in Scheme 1 may be found in the Examples section below.\n\n\nCompounds wherein M is a group D2 can be made in an analogous manner but using 4,5-dimethoxy-benzene-1,2-diamine instead of the diamine (XVI) in Scheme 1.\n\n\nIn an alternative synthesis of compounds of the formula (I) wherein A is a bond, the diamines 4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-benzene-1,2-diamine and 4,5-dimethoxy-benzene-1,2-diamine can also be reacted with carboxylic acids of the formula (XVII) where A is a bond to give compounds of the formula (I).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction of the diamine with the carboxylic acid (XVII) can be carried out under conditions analogous to those described above for preparing the nitro-compounds (XI). Carboxylic acids of the formula (XVII) can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 2.\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 2, a substituted or unsubstituted 4-nitro-3-pyrazole carboxylic acid (XVIII) can be esterified by reaction with thionyl chloride to give the acid chloride intermediate followed by reaction with ethanol to form the ethyl ester (XIX). Alternatively, the esterification can be carried out by reacting the alcohol and carboxylic acid in the presence of an acidic catalyst, one example of which is thionyl chloride. The reaction is typically carried out at room temperature using the esterifying alcohol (e.g. ethanol) as the solvent. The nitro group can then be reduced using palladium on carbon according to standard methods to give the amine (XX). The amine (XX) is coupled with an appropriate carboxylic acid R\n1\n-E-CO\n2\nH under amide forming conditions the same as or analogous to those described above to give the amide (XXI). The ester group of the amide (XXI) can then be hydrolysed using an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide in a polar water miscible solvent such as methanol, typically at room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) in which A is NR\n2 \ncan be prepared using standard methods for the synthesis of ureas. For example, such compounds can be prepared by reacting an aminopyrazole compound of the formula (X) with a suitably substituted isocyanate of the formula R\n1\n-E-N═C═O in a polar solvent such as DMF. The reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature.\n\n\nAlternatively, ureas of the formula (I) can be prepared by reacting an amine of the formula (X) with an amine of the formula R\n1\n-E-NH\n2 \nin the presence of carbonyl diimidazole (CDI). The reaction is typically carried out in a polar solvent such as THF with heating (for example using a microwave heater) to a temperature of up to about 150° C.\n\n\nInstead of using CDI, the coupling of the two amines to form the urea can be effected using triphosgene (bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate) in the presence of a non-interfering base such as triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane at room temperature or below.\n\n\nAs a further alternative to CDI, phosgene may be used instead of triphosgene.\n\n\nIn many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and deprotecting functional groups, can be found in \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis \n(T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999). A hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (—OR) or an ester (—OC(═O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl(diphenylmethyl), or trityl(triphenylmethyl)ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (—OC(═O)CH\n3\n, —OAc). An aldehyde or ketone group may be protected, for example, as an acetal (R—CH(OR)\n2\n) or ketal (R\n2\nC(OR)\n2\n), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (>C═O) is converted to a diether (>C(OR)\n2\n), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. An amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (—NRCO—R) or a urethane (—NRCO—OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (—NHCO—CH\n3\n); a benzyloxy amide (—NHCO—OCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, —NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (—NHCO—OC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, —NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (—NHCO—OC(CH\n3\n)\n2\nC\n6\nH\n4\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, —NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (—NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (—NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (—NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (—NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (—NH-Alloc), or as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (—NH-Psec). Other protecting groups for amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N—H groups, include toluenesulphonyl (tosyl) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups and benzyl groups such as a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. A carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C\n1-7 \nalkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C\n1-7 \nhaloalkyl ester (e.g., a C\n1-7 \ntrihaloalkyl ester); a triC\n1-7 \nalkylsilyl-C\n1-7\nalkyl ester; or a C\n5-20 \naryl-C\n1-7 \nalkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide. A thiol group may be protected, for example, as a thioether (—SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (—S—CH\n2\nNHC(═O)CH\n3\n).\n\n\nThe acid addition salts constituting sub-group (C) of formula (I) can be formed during the synthesis of the parent compound 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, or by conversion of the free base of the parent compound to a desired salt, or by conversion of one salt of the parent compound to another desired salt of the parent compound. The parent compound 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea (the compound of formula (IA)) can be prepared by the method illustrated in Scheme 3 below. As shown in Scheme 3, the 3,4-dinitrocarboxylic acid (XIII), a commercially available compound, is converted to the morpholide (XXI). Formation of the amide can be accomplished by converting the acid (XIII) to an active derivative such as an acid chloride using standard methods. For example, the acid chloride can be formed by heating with excess thionyl chloride at the reflux temperature of the thionyl chloride and then removing excess thionyl chloride by azeotrope with toluene.\n\n\nThe morpholide (XXI) can be reduced to the dinitrobenzyl morpholine (XXIII) by treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in combination with boron trifluoride. The reduction reaction is typically carried out in an anhydrous solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a reduced temperature, for example a temperature of 0-5° C. The dinitrobenzylmorpholine (XXIII) can then be reduced to the diaminobenzylmorpholine (XXIV) under standard conditions, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a polar solvent such as ethanol at room temperature.\n\n\nThe diaminobenzyl morpholine (XXIV) is then reacted with the commercially available 4-nitropyrazole-3-carboxylic acid to form the nitropyrazolyl-benzimidazole (XXV). The formation of the nitropyrazolyl-benzimidazole (XXV) may be achieved by first forming an amide bond between the carboxylic acid and the diaminobenzyl compound (XXIV) using a peptide coupling reagent such as O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) capable of promoting amide bond formation with an aromatic amine group. The intermediate amide (not shown) is then cyclised to the nitro-pyrazolyl-benzimidazole (XXV) by heating in excess glacial acetic acid, for example at a temperature of approximately 65° C.\n\n\nThe nitropyrazolyl-benzimidazole (XXV) can be reduced to the corresponding amine (XXVI) under standard conditions. The reduction may be effected, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a polar solvent such as ethanol or dimethylformamide at room temperature.\n\n\nThe amine (XXVI) can in turn be converted to the urea (IA) using standard methods for the synthesis of ureas, for example by reacting the amine (XXVI) with 2,6-difluorophenyl-isocyanate in a polar solvent such as THF at room temperature or below, for example at a temperature of 0-5° C.\n\n\nThe free base form of the urea (IA) can be used to prepare the acid addition salts of the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salts of the present invention can be prepared from the free base by conventional methods such as the methods described in \nPharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use\n, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. For example, the salts can be prepared by reacting the free base with the appropriate acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing an acid addition salt of 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, which method comprises forming a solution of 1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base in a solvent (typically an organic solvent) or mixture of solvents, and treating the solution with an acid to form a precipitate of the acid addition salt.\n\n\nThe acid is typically added as a solution in a solvent which is miscible with the solvent in which the free base is dissolved.\n\n\nThe solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt thereof is insoluble. Alternatively, the solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt is at least partially soluble, a different solvent in which the acid addition salt is less soluble subsequently being added such that the salt precipitates out of solution.\n\n\nFor example, in one method of preparing the salts of the invention, the free base is dissolved in a first solvent (which can be ethyl acetate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and an alcohol such as methanol) and a solution (e.g. a concentrated or saturated solution) of an acid such as hydrochloric acid in a second solvent (which can be an ether such as diethyl ether or dioxin) is then added such that a precipitate of the acid addition salt is formed, and the precipitate is then collected, for example by filtration.\n\n\nProcesses for Preparing 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea\n\n\nIn the examples of our earlier application WO 2005/002552 and in Schemes 1 and 3 above, it is disclosed that a [3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-amide can be prepared by a sequence of steps including:\n\n\n(i) reacting 4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-benzene-1,2-diamine with 4-nitro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) to give 5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-2-(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) 1H-benzimidazole; and\n\n\n(ii) reducing the nitro group by treatment with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere;\n\n\nor\n\n\n(i) reacting the 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic ester with the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) or with the appropriate acid chloride in the presence of triethylamine to form the 4-amide-1H-pyrazole carboxylic acid; and\n\n\n(ii) reacting 4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-benzene-1,2-diamine with the appropriate 4-amide-1H-pyrazole carboxylic acid in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in dimethyl form amide (DMF) to give the [3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-amide.\n\n\n\nIt has now been found that instead of reacting the nitro-pyrazole compound with the diamine and then reducing the nitro group to the amine, or reacting the amide-pyrazole with the diamine, the amino-pyrazole may be reacted with the diamine provided that the amino group of the aminopyrazole is appropriately protected. The product of the reaction can then be cyclised to form the benzimidazole. In addition, it has been found that removal of the amine protecting group and cyclisation to the benzimidazole can be performed in one step.\n\n\nAccordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula (XXVII) or (XXVIII) or a salt thereof:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhich process comprises:\n\n\n(i) the reaction of a compound of the formula (XXIX):\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere PG is an amine-protecting group:\n\n\n(ii) with a compound of the formula (XXXI):\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin an organic solvent in the presence of a coupling agent such as EDC and HOBt: Formula (XXVIII) is a regioisomer of (XXVII).\n\n\n\nThe amine-protecting group PG can be any protecting group known for use in protecting amine groups under the conditions used in the above process, see for example Green et al. referred to above. Thus, for example, the nitrogen may be protected as an amide (NCO—R) or a urethane (NCO—OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (NCO—CH\n3\n); a benzyloxy amide (NCO—OCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, —NH-Cbz); as a tert-butoxy amide (—NCO—OC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, N-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (NCO—OC(CH\n3\n)\n2\nC\n6\nH\n4\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, N-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (N-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (N-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (N-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (N-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (N-Alloc), or as a 2-(phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (—N-Psec). Other protecting groups for amines include benzyl groups such as a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. Preferred amine protecting groups are a urethane (NCO—OR), for example, a benzyloxy amide (NCO—OCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n5\n, —NH-Cbz), or a tert-butoxy amide (—NCO—OC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, N-Boc); or an allyloxy amide (N-Alloc). In one embodiment, the protecting group PG is a protecting group APG, which is an amine protecting group that may be removed under acidic conditions. Such groups include the urethanes. A particularly preferred urethane protecting group is tert-butyloxycarbonyl which may be removed under acidic conditions.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protecting group PG is then removed from the compound of formula (XXVII) or (XXVIII) and replaced with a protecting group, APG, to form a compound of formula (XXVIIa) or (XXVIIIa).\n\n\nOne particularly preferred compound of formula (XXIX) is the compound of the formula (XXXII) below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invention further provides a novel chemical intermediate per se of the formula (XXXII).\n\n\nThe invention also provides novel chemical intermediates per se of formula (XXVII) or (XXVIII), for example novel chemical intermediates of formula (XXVIIa) or (XXVIIIa) below. Therefore the invention provides 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (2-amino-4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-amide or 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (2-amino-5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-amide and protected forms thereof as a novel chemical intermediates. One particular preferred novel chemical intermediate of formula ((XXVII) is [3-(2-amino-4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenylcarbamoyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester. One particularly preferred novel chemical intermediate of Formula (XXVIII) is [3-(2-amino-5-morpholin-4-ylmethylphenylcarbamoyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester.\n\n\nWhen the protecting group PG is a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group, the overall yield from the process is in excess of 85%. Furthermore, the process is advantageous in that it makes use of relatively simple and inexpensive reagents and solvents and is also advantageous with respect to the ease of purification of the products.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing 3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamine or a salt thereof, which process comprises:\n\n\n(i) treating a compound of the formula (XXVIIa) or (XXVIIIa):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith an acid in a solvent, optionally with heating; and\n\n\n(ii) neutralizing the reaction.\n\n\n\nThe amine-protecting group APG can be any protecting group known for use in protecting amine groups as defined above in relation to the compounds of the formulae (XXVII) or (XXVIII), and which is removable under the conditions used in the above process.\n\n\nIn step (i), the reaction with acid may be carried out with heating, for example to a temperature in the \nrange\n 80 to 100° C. The solvent in which step (i) is carried out is an alcohol solvent, and it may be, for example, ethanol.\n\n\nIn step (i), the protecting group is preferably one such as the Boc group that can be removed by treatment with acid, the acid being selected so as be appropriate for protonation of the intermediate to activate the carbonyl group for the cyclisation reaction. Suitable acids include strong acids such as sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid or hydrochloric acid, and one particular acid is hydrochloric acid.\n\n\nFollowing completion of the reaction in step (i), as judged for example by the disappearance of starting material (XIIIa), the reaction can be neutralized.\n\n\nIn step (ii), a non-interfering base is used. The term “non-interfering base” in the present context means a base such as sodium carbonate which will not react with compound produced. Step (ii) is typically carried out at room temperature.\n\n\nIn step (ii), the reaction is neutralized for example until the reaction is saturated with neutralizing agent and at pH 8.5.\n\n\nFollowing step (ii), the compound can be reacted with carbonylating reagent such as 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or a phosgene equivalent and then treated with cyclopropylamine. Phosgene equivalents include triphosgene or phosgene. A preferred carbonylating reagent is 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI).\n\n\nAlternatively, the urea can be prepared by reacting the aminopyrazole, 3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamine, with phenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as pyridine in solvent e.g. THF to give the cyclic urea and then treating with cyclopropylamine, or by reacting the aminopyrazole with cyclopropylisocyanate which can be made from the Curtius rearrangement of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid azide (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,755 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,299,778).\n\n\nThus, a further aspect of the invention is a process for preparing 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5n-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof, which process comprises:\n\n\n(i) treating a compound of the formula ((XXVIIa) with an acid in a solvent, optionally with heating;\n\n\n(ii) neutralizing the reaction;\n\n\n(iii) reacting the product of step (ii) with carbonylating reagent;\n\n\n(iv) reacting the product of step (iii) with cyclopropylamine.\n\n\nStep (iii) is typically carried out under reflux, for example to a temperature of up to about 100° C., more typically up to 70-75° C. In step (iii), the reaction may be carried out in a polar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. A carbonylating reagent can be a compound such as 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or a phosgene equivalent such as triphosgene or phosgene. A preferred carbonylating reagent is 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI).\n\n\nStep (iv) is typically carried out with heating, for example to a temperature of up to about 100° C.\n\n\nFollowing step (iv), the product may subjected to salt conversion or recrystallisation (e.g. using 2-propanol or ethanol as the solvent) to increase the purity and to give a crystalline form.\n\n\nStep (iii) above gives rise to an intermediate compound of the formula (XXXIII) and/or its regioisomer (XXXIIIa):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intermediates of formulae (XXXIII) and (XXXIIIa), which can be isolated if required, are then reacted with cyclopropylamine to give a compound of the formula (XXX).\n\n\nAccordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula (XXX) as defined herein, which process comprises reacting a compound of the formula (XXXIII) or (XXXIIIa) with cyclopropylamine, and thereafter optionally forming an acid addition salt of the compound of the formula (XXX). The reaction is typically carried out in a polar aprotic solvent such as N-methyl pyrrolidone, preferably at an elevated temperature such as a temperature in excess of 80° C., more typically in excess of 90° C., for example 95° C. to 105° C.\n\n\nThe foregoing process may also be used to prepare other compounds of the formula (I) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein where the moiety A in formula (I) is a group NH.\n\n\nAccordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula (I) as defined herein, wherein the moiety A in formula (I) is a group NH; which process comprises the reaction of (i) a compound of the formula (XXXIII) and/or its regioisomer (XXXIIIa), or (ii) a compound of the formula (XXXIV) and/or its regioisomer (XXXIVa):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith a compound of the formula R\n1\n-E-NH\n2\n, preferably in a polar aprotic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone, preferably at an elevated temperature such as a temperature in excess of 80° C., more typically in excess of 90° C., for example 95° C. to 105° C., and thereafter optionally forming an acid addition salt of the compound of formula (I).\n\n\n\nThe invention further provides novel chemical intermediates of the formulae (XXXIII), (XXXIIIa), (XXXIV) and (XXXIVa).\n\n\nIn further embodiments, the compound of formula ((XXVIIa) in the process for preparing 3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamine or a salt thereof or process for preparing 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof above, can be prepared by a process which comprises:\n\n\n(i) reaction of a compound of the formula (XXIX), where PG is an amine-protecting group which is removable with acid, APG;\n\n\n(ii) with a compound of the formula (XXXI) in an organic solvent in the presence of a coupling agent such as EDC and HOBt.\n\n\nOptionally the processes described herein have the further step of recrystallizing the salt to give a crystalline form, e.g. a crystalline form as defined herein.\n\n\nMethods of Purification\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be isolated and purified by a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art and examples of such methods include chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography (e.g. flash chromatography) and HPLC. Preparative LC-MS is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; \nJ Comb Chem.; \n2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C., Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; \nJ Comb Chem.; \n2003; 5(3); 322-9.\n\n\nOne such system for purifying compounds via preparative LC-MS is described in the experimental section below although a person skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative systems and methods to those described could be used. In particular, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of the reverse phase methods described here. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described above could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.\n\n\nRecrystallisation\n\n\nMethods of recrystallisation of compounds of formula (I) and salt thereof, in particular 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and its salts can be carried out by methods well known to the skilled person—see for example (P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: \nProperties, Selection, and Use\n, Chapter 8, Publisher Wiley-VCH). Products obtained from an organic reaction are seldom pure when isolated directly from the reaction mixture. If the compound (or a salt thereof) is solid, it may be purified and/or crystallized by recrystallization from a suitable solvent. A good recrystallization solvent should dissolve a moderate quantity of the substance to be purified at elevated temperatures but only a small quantity of the substance at lower temperature. It should dissolve impurities readily at low temperatures or not at all. Finally, the solvent should be readily removed from the purified product. This usually means that it has a relatively low boiling point and a person skilled in the art will know recrystallizing solvents for a particular substance, or if that information is not available, test several solvents. To get a good yield of purified material, the minimum amount of hot solvent to dissolve all the impure material is used. In practice, 3-5% more solvent than necessary is used so the solution is not saturated. If the impure compound contains an impurity which is insoluble in the solvent it may then be removed by filtration and then allowing the solution to crystallize. In addition, if the impure compound contains traces of coloured material that are not native to the compound, it may be removed by adding a small amount of decolorizing charcoal to the hot solution, filtering it and then allowing it to crystallize. Usually crystallization spontaneously occurs upon cooling the solution. If it is not, crystallization may be induced by cooling the solution below room temperature or by adding a single crystal of pure material (a seed crystal). Recrystallisation can also be carried out and/or the yield optimized by the use of an anti-solvent. In this case, the compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature, filtered and then an additional solvent in which the required compound has low solubility is added to aid crystallization. The crystals are then typically isolated using vacuum filtration, washed and then dried, for example, in an oven or via desiccation.\n\n\nOther examples of methods for crystallization include crystallization from a vapor, which includes an evaporation step for example in a sealed tube or an air stream, and crystallization from melt (Crystallization Technology Handbook 2nd Edition, edited by A. Mersmann, 2001).\n\n\nIn particular the compound of formula (I) may subjected to recrystallisation (e.g. using 2-propanol or ethanol as the solvent) to increase the purity and to give a crystalline form.\n\n\nGenerally, the crystals obtained are analysed by an X-ray diffraction method such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) or X-ray crystal diffraction.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\nWhile it is possible for the active compound or salt thereof to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation) comprising at least one active compound of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents; for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).\n\n\nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\n\n\nAccordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides compounds of the formula (I) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (II) and (III) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery. The delivery can be by bolus injection, short term infusion or longer term infusion and can be via passive delivery or through the utilisation of a suitable infusion pump.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Examples of these are described in R. G. Strickly, Solubilizing Excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 21(2) 2004, p 201-230. In addition, they may contain co-solvents, organic solvent mixtures, cyclodextrin complexation agents, emulsifying agents (for forming and stabilizing emulsion formulations), liposome components for forming liposomes, gellable polymers for forming polymeric gels, lyophilisation protectants and combinations of agents for, inter alia, stabilising the active ingredient in a soluble form and rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.\n\n\nA drug molecule that is ionizable can be solubilized to the desired concentration by pH adjustment if the drug's pKa is sufficiently away from the formulation pH value. The acceptable range is pH 2-12 for intravenous and intramuscular administration, but subcutaneously the range is pH 2.7-9.0. The solution pH is controlled by either the salt form of the drug, strong acids/bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or by solutions of buffers which include but are not limited to buffering solutions formed from glycine, citrate, acetate, maleate, succinate, histidine, phosphate, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS), or carbonate.\n\n\nThe combination of an aqueous solution and a water-soluble organic solvent/surfactant (i.e., a cosolvent) is often used in injectable formulations. The water-soluble organic solvents and surfactants used in injectable formulations include but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethanol, polyethylene glycol 300, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP; Pharmasolve), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Solutol HS 15, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and \npolysorbate\n 80. Such formulations can usually be, but are not always, diluted prior to injection.\n\n\nPropylene glycol, PEG 300, ethanol, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and \npolysorbate\n 80 are the entirely organic water-miscible solvents and surfactants used in commercially available injectable formulations and can be used in combinations with each other. The resulting organic formulations are usually diluted at least 2-fold prior to IV bolus or IV infusion.\n\n\nAlternatively increased water solubility can be achieved through molecular complexation with cyclodextrins\n\n\nLiposomes are closed spherical vesicles composed of outer lipid bilayer membranes and an inner aqueous core and with an overall diameter of <100 μm. Depending on the level of hydrophobicity, moderately hydrophobic drugs can be solubilized by liposomes if the drug becomes encapsulated or intercalated within the liposome. Hydrophobic drugs can also be solubilized by liposomes if the drug molecule becomes an integral part of the lipid bilayer membrane, and in this case, the hydrophobic drug is dissolved in the lipid portion of the lipid bilayer. A typical liposome formulation contains water with phospholipid at −5-20 mg/ml, an isotonicifier, a pH 5-8 buffer, and optionally cholesterol.\n\n\nThe formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by lyophilising a compound of Formula (I) or acid addition salt thereof. Lyophilisation refers to the procedure of freeze-drying a composition. Freeze-drying and lyophilisation are therefore used herein as synonyms. A typical process is to solubilize the compound and the resulting formulation is clarified, sterile filtered and aseptically transferred to containers appropriate for lyophilisation (e.g. vials). In the case of vials, they are partially stoppered with lyo-stoppers. The formulation can be cooled to freezing and subjected to lyophilisation under standard conditions and then hermetically capped forming a stable, dry lyophile formulation. The composition will typically have a low residual water content, e.g. less than 5% e.g. less than 1% by weight based on weight of the lyophile.\n\n\nThe lyophilisation formulation may contain other excipients for example, thickening agents, dispersing agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservatives, and tonicity adjusters. Typical buffers include phosphate, acetate, citrate and glycine. Examples of antioxidants include ascorbic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, monothioglycerol, thiourea, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyl anisole, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid salts. Preservatives may include benzoic acid and its salts, sorbic acid and its salts, alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride. The buffers mentioned previously, as well as dextrose and sodium chloride, can be used for tonicity adjustment if necessary.\n\n\nBulking agents are generally used in lyophilisation technology for facilitating the process and/or providing bulk and/or mechanical integrity to the lyophilized cake. Bulking agent means a freely water soluble, solid particulate diluent that when co-lyophilised with the compound or salt thereof, provides a physically stable lyophilized cake, a more optimal freeze-drying process and rapid and complete reconstitution. The bulking agent may also be utilised to make the solution isotonic.\n\n\nThe water-soluble bulking agent can be any of the pharmaceutically acceptable inert solid materials typically used for lyophilisation. Such bulking agents include, for example, sugars such as glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose; polyalcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol; amino acids such as glycine; polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidine; and polysaccharides such as dextran.\n\n\nThe ratio of the weight of the bulking agent to the weight of active compound is typically within the range from about 1 to about 5, for example of about 1 to about 3, e.g. in the range of about 1 to 2.\n\n\nAlternatively they can be provided in a solution form which may be concentrated and sealed in a suitable vial. Sterilisation of dosage forms may be via filtration or by autoclaving of the vials and their contents at appropriate stages of the formulation process. The supplied formulation may require further dilution or preparation before delivery for example dilution into suitable sterile infusion packs.\n\n\nExtemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection can also comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nIf a compound is not stable in aqueous media or has low solubility in aqueous media, it can be formulated as a concentrate in organic solvents. The concentrate can then be diluted to a lower concentration in an aqueous system, and can be sufficiently stable for the short period of time during dosing. Therefore in another aspect, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a non aqueous solution composed entirely of one or more organic solvents, which can be dosed as is or more commonly diluted with a suitable IV excipient (saline, dextrose; buffered or not buffered) before administration (Solubilizing excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, 21(2), 2004, p201-230). Examples of solvents and surfactants are propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400, ethanol, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Pharmasolve), Glycerin, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60 and polysorbate. Particular non aqueous solutions are composed of 70-80% propylene glycol, and 20-30% ethanol. One particular non aqueous solution is composed of 70% propylene glycol, and 30% ethanol. Another is 80% propylene glycol and 20% ethanol. Normally these solvents are used in combination and usually diluted at least 2-fold before IV bolus or IV infusion. The typical amounts for bolus IV formulations are ˜50% for Glycerin, propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400, and ˜20% for ethanol. The typical amounts for IV infusion formulations are ˜15% for Glycerin, 3% for DMA, and 10% for propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400 and ethanol.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion. For intravenous administration, the solution can be dosed as is, or can be injected into an infusion bag (containing a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose), before administration.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.\n\n\nPharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., USA.\n\n\nThus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.\n\n\nCapsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.\n\n\nThe solid dosage forms (e.g.; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit™ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.\n\n\nInstead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions comprise from approximately 1% to approximately 95%, preferably from approximately 20% to approximately 90%, active ingredient. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be, for example, in unit dose form, such as in the form of ampoules, vials, suppositories, dragées, tablets or capsules.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture, if desired or necessary, after the addition of appropriate excipients, into tablets, dragee cores or capsules. It is also possible for them to be incorporated into plastics carriers that allow the active ingredients to diffuse or be released in measured amounts.\n\n\nCompositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.\n\n\nCompositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.\n\n\nExamples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.\n\n\nCompositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical formulations may be presented to a patient in “patient packs” containing an entire course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.\n\n\nThe compounds of the inventions will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration may contain from 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient, e.g. from 1 nanogram to 2 milligrams of active ingredient. Within this range, particular sub-ranges of compound are 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient (more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example, 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams or 1 microgram to 20 milligrams (for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams, e.g. 0.1 milligrams to 2 milligrams of active ingredient).\n\n\nFor oral compositions, a unit dosage form may contain from 1 milligram to 2 grams, more typically 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example 50 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 100 milligrams to 1 gram, of active compound.\n\n\nThe active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\nMethods of Treatment\n\n\nIt is envisaged that the compounds of the formulae (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups as defined herein will be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by cyclin dependent kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Aurora kinases. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out above.\n\n\nThe compounds are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.\n\n\nThe compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a compound of the formula (I) may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.\n\n\nThe compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner.\n\n\nA typical daily dose of the compound can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 5 nanograms to 25 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, and more usually 10 nanograms to 15 milligrams per kilogram (e.g. 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams, and more typically 1 microgram per kilogram to 20 milligrams per kilogram, such as 1 microgram to 10 milligrams) per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required.\n\n\nThe compounds (e.g. the compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt) can be administered on a daily basis or on a repeat basis every 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 or 14, or 21, or 28 days for example. Ultimately, however, the quantity of compound administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.\n\n\nAn example of a daily dosage regimen for the compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof such as the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt comprises administering the said compound (e.g. in the form of the L-lactate salt) at a starting dosage of 1 mg/m\n2\n/day-100 mg/m\n2\n/day, in particular 1 mg/m\n2\n/day-10 mg/m\n2\n/day more particularly 3-6 mg/m\n2\n/day (equivalent to 2.5-5 mg free base/m\n2\n/day) or at an efficacious dose of the lactate salt of 2.5 mg/m\n2\n/day-1.5 g/m\n2\n/day, in particular 25 mg/m\n2\n/day-600 mg/m\n2\n/day, more particularly 200-500 mg/m\n2\n/day such as 250 mg/m\n2\n/day or 45-200 mg/m\n2\n/day such as 45-150 mg/m\n2\n/day or 56-185 mg/m\n2\n/day (equivalent to 45-150 mg free base/m\n2\n/day) although higher or lower doses may be administered where required.\n\n\nIn one particular dosing schedule, a patient will be given accontinuous IV infusion of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof such as the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt, for periods of 2 hour to 120 hour, for example 2 to 96 hour in particular for 24 to 72 hour and the treatment repeated at a desired interval such as every one to three weeks.\n\n\nMore particularly, a patient may be given a continuous IV infusion of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof such as the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt for periods of 24 hour daily for 5 days and the treatment repeated every week, or for periods of 48 hour and the treatment repeated every two weeks or for periods of 72 hour and the treatment repeated every three weeks.\n\n\nIn another particular dosing schedule, a patient is given an infusion of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or a salt thereof such as the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt as an IV bolus over 2 hour once a day for a week every 1, 2, or 3 weeks or over 2 hour once every 1, 2, or 3 weeks.\n\n\nHigher doses such as 1.5 g/m\n2\n/day could be administered using a dosing regimen with frequent off-treatment periods such as 24 to 48 hour continuous IV fusion every one to two weeks. Lower dosages such could be administered using a dosing regimens with more sustained dosing (but still cyclical on/off) such as 48 to 72 hour continuous IV fusion every two to three weeks.\n\n\nIn particular, compounds of the formula (I′) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt in particular the lactate salt could be administered to a patient at 250 mg/m\n2\n/day for 72 hours by continuous IV infusion every 3 weeks.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, compounds of the formula (I′) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt in particular the lactate salt could be administered to a patient over a five day treatment cycle.\n\n\nUltimately, the quantity of compound administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.\n\n\nThe compounds of formulae (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups as defined herein can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined. Examples of other therapeutic agents or therapies that may be administered or used together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the compounds of the invention include but are not limited to topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, DNA binders, microtubule inhibitors (tubulin targeting agents), particular examples being cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, irinotecan, fludarabine, 5FU, taxanes, mitomycin C and radiotherapy.\n\n\nOther examples of therapeutic agents that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the compounds of the formulae (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups as defined herein include monoclonal antibodies and signal transduction inhibitors.\n\n\nFor the case of CDK or Aurora inhibitors combined with other therapies, the two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.\n\n\nWhere the compound of the formula (I) is administered in combination therapy with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (preferably one or two, more preferably one), the compounds can be administered simultaneously (either in the same or different pharmaceutical formulation) or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy; surgery and controlled diets.\n\n\nFor use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the compound of the formula (I) and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.\n\n\nA person skilled in the art would know through his or her common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.\n\n\nMethods of Diagnosis\n\n\nPrior to administration of a compound of the formula (I), a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Aurora and/or cyclin dependent kinases.\n\n\nFor example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to over-activation of CDKs or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal CDK activity. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation or sensitisation of the CDK2 signal include up-regulation of cyclin E, (Harwell R M, Mull B B, Porter D C, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol. Chem. 2004 Mar. 26; 279(13):12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants (Rajagopalan H, Jallepalli P V, Rago C, Velculescu V E, Kinzler K W, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C.; Nature. 2004 Mar. 4; 428(6978):77-81). Tumours with mutants of CDC4 or up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Alternatively or in addition, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by upregulation of Aurora kinase and thus may be particularly to Aurora inhibitors. The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations.\n\n\nThus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of over-expression, up-regulation or activation of Aurora kinase or the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of Aurora or CDC4. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of Aurora or cyclin E, including enzyme-activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins. Tumours with upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 prior to treatment. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27.\n\n\nThe diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or urine.\n\n\nIt has been found, see Ewart-Toland et al., (Nat. Genet. 2003 August; 34(4):403-12), that individuals forming part of the sub-population possessing the Ile31 variant of the STK gene (the gene for Aurora kinase A) may have an increased susceptibility to certain forms of cancer. It is envisaged therefore that such individuals suffering from cancer will benefit from the administration of compounds having Aurora kinase inhibiting activity. A patient suffering from, or suspected of suffering from, a cancer may therefore be screened to determine whether he or she forms part of the Ile31 variant sub-population. In addition, it has been found, Rajagopalan et al (Nature. 2004 Mar. 4; 428(6978):77-81), that there were mutations present in CDC4 (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) in human colorectal cancers and endometrial cancers (Spruck et al, Cancer Res. 2002 Aug. 15; 62(16):4535-9). Identification of individual carrying a mutation in CDC4 may mean that the patient would be particularly suitable for treatment with a CDK inhibitor. Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a CDC4 variant prior to treatment. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody.\n\n\nTumours with activating mutants of Aurora or up-regulation of Aurora including any of the isoforms thereof, may be particularly sensitive to Aurora inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for up-regulation of Aurora or for Aurora possessing the Ile31 variant prior to treatment (Ewart-Toland et al., Nat. Genet. 2003 August; 34(4):403-12). Ewart-Toland et al identified a common genetic variant in STK15 (resulting in the amino acid substitution F31I) that is preferentially amplified and associated with the degree of aneuploidy in human colon tumors. These results are consistent with an important role for the Ile31 variant of STK15 in human cancer susceptibility. In particular, this polymorphism in Aurora A has been suggested to be a genetic modifier fir developing breast carcinoma (Sun et al, Carcinogenesis, 2004, 25(11), 2225-2230).\n\n\nThe aurora A gene maps to the chromosome 20q13 region that is frequently amplified in many cancers e.g. breast, bladder, colon, ovarian, pancreatic. Patients with a tumour that has this gene amplification might be particularly sensitive to treatments targeting aurora kinase inhibition.\n\n\nMethods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of protein e.g. Aurora isoforms and chromosome 20q13 amplification are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridisation.\n\n\nIn screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley & Sons Inc., or Innis, M. A. et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3\nrd \nEd, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAn example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152: 649).\n\n\nGenerally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labeled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley & Sons Inc and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine.\n\n\nAlternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or detection of CDC4 variants, Aurora up-regulation and mutants of Aurora could be applicable in the present case.\n\n\nTherefore, all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nTumours with mutants of CDC4 or up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E (Harwell R M, Mull B B, Porter D C, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol. Chem. 2004 Mar. 26; 279(13):12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27 or for CDC4 variants prior to treatment (Rajagopalan H, Jallepalli P V, Rago C, Velculescu V E, Kinzler K W, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C.; Nature. 2004 Mar. 4; 428(6978):77-81).\n\n\nPatients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) could be selected for treatment with a compound of the invention using diagnostic tests outlined herein. MCL is a distinct clinicopathologic entity of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, characterized by proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with co-expression of CD5 and CD20, an aggressive and incurable clinical course, and frequent t(11; 14)(q13; q32) translocation. Over-expression of cyclin D1 mRNA, found in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), is a critical diagnostic marker. Yatabe et al (Blood. 2000 Apr. 1; 95(7):2253-61) proposed that cyclin D1-positively should be included as one of the standard criteria for MCL, and that innovative therapies for this incurable disease should be explored on the basis of the new criteria. Jones et al (J Mol. Diagn. 2004 May; 6(2):84-9) developed a real-time, quantitative, reverse transcription PCR assay for cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression to aid in the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Howe et al (Clin Chem. 2004 January; 50(1):80-7) used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate cyclin D1 mRNA expression and found that quantitative RT-PCR for cyclin D1 mRNA normalized to CD19 mRNA can be used in the diagnosis of MCL in blood, marrow, and tissue. Alternatively, patients with breast cancer could be selected for treatment with a CDK inhibitor using diagnostic tests outline above. Tumour cells commonly overexpress cyclin E and it has been shown that cyclin E is over-expressed in breast cancer (Harwell et al, Cancer Res, 2000, 60, 481-489). Therefore breast cancer may in particular be treated with a CDK inhibitor as provided herein.\n\n\nAntifungal Use\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides the use of the compounds of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein as antifungal agents.\n\n\nThe compounds of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein may be used in animal medicine (for example in the treatment of mammals such as humans), or in the treatment of plants (e.g. in agriculture and horticulture), or as general antifungal agents, for example as preservatives and disinfectants.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a fungal infection in a mammal such as a human.\n\n\nAlso provided is the use of a compound of the formula (I), (II). (III), and sub-groups thereof as defined herein for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a fungal infection in a mammal such as a human.\n\n\nFor example, compounds of the invention may be administered to human patients suffering from, or at risk of infection by, topical fungal infections caused by among other organisms, species of \nCandida, Trichophyton, Microsporum \nor \nEpidermophyton\n, or in mucosal infections caused by \nCandida albicans \n(e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis). The compounds of the invention can also be administered for the treatment or prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, \nCandida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidiodies, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma \nor \nBlastomyces. \n \n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides an antifungal composition for agricultural (including horticultural) use, comprising a compound of the formulae (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein together with an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a method of treating an animal (including a mammal such as a human), plant or seed having a fungal infection, which comprises treating said animal, plant or seed, or the locus of said plant or seed, with an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a method of treating a fungal infection in a plant or seed which comprises treating the plant or seed with an antifungally effective amount of a fungicidal composition containing a compound of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX), and sub-groups thereof as defined herein.\n\n\nDifferential screening assays may be used to select for those compounds of the present invention with specificity for non-human CDK enzymes. Compounds which act specifically on the CDK enzymes of eukaryotic pathogens can be used as anti-fungal or anti-parasitic agents. Inhibitors of the \nCandida \nCDK kinase, CKSI, can be used in the treatment of candidiasis. Antifungal agents can be used against infections of the type hereinbefore defined, or opportunistic infections that commonly occur in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients such as patients with leukemias and lymphomas, people who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, as well as for non-immunosuppressed patients.\n\n\nAssays described in the art can be used to screen for agents which may be useful for inhibiting at least one fungus implicated in mycosis such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, blastomycosis, geotrichosis, cryptococcosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, conidiosporosis, histoplasmosis, maduromycosis, rhinosporidosis, nocardiosis, para-actinomycosis, penicilliosis, monoliasis, or sporotrichosis. The differential screening assays can be used to identify anti-fungal agents which may have therapeutic value in the treatment of aspergillosis by making use of the CDK genes cloned from yeast such as \nAspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans\n, or \nAspergillus terreus\n, or where the mycotic infection is mucon-nycosis, the CDK assay can be derived from yeast such as \nRhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus oryzae, Absidia corymbifera, Absidia ramosa\n, or \nMucor pusillus\n. Sources of other CDK enzymes include the pathogen \nPneumocystis carinii. \n \n\n\nBy way of example, in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (M.I.C.) which is the concentration of the test compounds, in a suitable medium, at which growth of the particular microorganism fails to occur. In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration is inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, \nCandida albicans \nand each plate is then incubated for an appropriate period at 37° C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate M.I.C. value is noted. Alternatively, a turbidity assay in liquid cultures can be performed and a protocol outlining an example of this assay can be found in Example 64.\n\n\nThe in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice that have been inoculated with a fungus, e.g., a strain of \nCandida albicans \nor \nAspergillus flavus\n. The activity of the compounds can be assessed by monitoring the growth of the fungal infection in groups of treated and untreated mice (by histology or by retrieving fungi from the infection). The activity may be measured in terms of the dose level at which the compound provides 50% protection against the lethal effect of the infection (PD\n50\n).\n\n\nFor human antifungal use, the compounds of the formula (I), (II), (III), (XXX) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein can be administered alone or in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected in accordance with the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Thus, for example, they may be administered orally, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously by means of the formulations described above in the section headed “Pharmaceutical Formulations”.\n\n\nFor oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the invention can be from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg (in divided doses), depending on inter alia the potency of the compounds when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Tablets or capsules of the compounds may contain, for example, from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage (effective amount) which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.\n\n\nAlternatively, the antifungal compounds can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin; or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10%, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required.\n\n\nIn addition to the therapeutic uses described above, anti-fungal agents developed with such differential screening assays can be used, for example, as preservatives in foodstuff, feed supplement for promoting weight gain in livestock, or in disinfectant formulations for treatment of non-living matter, e.g., for decontaminating hospital equipment and rooms. In similar fashion, side by side comparison of inhibition of a mammalian CDK and an insect CDK, such as the \nDrosophilia \nCDK5 gene (Hellmich et al. (1994) FEBS Lett 356:317-21), will permit selection amongst the compounds herein of inhibitors which discriminate between the human/mammalian and insect enzymes. Accordingly, the present invention expressly contemplates the use and formulation of the compounds of the invention in insecticides, such as for use in management of insects like the fruit fly.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, certain of the subject CDK inhibitors can be selected on the basis of inhibitory specificity for plant CDK's relative to the mammalian enzyme. For example, a plant CDK can be disposed in a differential screen with one or more of the human enzymes to select those compounds of greatest selectivity for inhibiting the plant enzyme. Thus, the present invention specifically contemplates formulations of the subject CDK inhibitors for agricultural applications, such as in the form of a defoliant or the like.\n\n\nFor agricultural and horticultural purposes the compounds of the invention may be used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and intended purpose. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be supplied in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they can be manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures. The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack.

System\n\n\n\nPreparative LC-MS is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; \nJ Comb Chem.; \n2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C., Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; \nJ Comb Chem.; \n2003; 5(3); 322-9.\n\n\nOne such system for purifying compounds via preparative LC-MS is described below although a person skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative systems and methods to those described could be used. In particular, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of the reverse phase methods described here. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described above could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.\n\n\nPreparative LC-MS Systems:\n\n\nWaters Fractionlynx System:\n\n\nHardware:\n\n\n2767 Dual Loop Autosampler/Fraction Collector\n\n\n2525 preparative pump\n\n\nCFO (column fluidic organizer) for column selection\n\n\nRMA (Waters reagent manager) as make up pump\n\n\nWaters ZQ Mass Spectrometer\n\n\nWaters 2996 Photo Diode Array detector\n\n\nWaters ZQ Mass Spectrometer\n\n\nSoftware:\n\n\nMasslynx 4.0\n\n\nWaters MS Running Conditions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCapillary voltage:\n \n3.5 kV (3.2 kV on ES Negative)\n \n \n \n \n \nCone voltage:\n \n25 V\n \n \n \n \n \nSource Temperature:\n \n120° C.\n \n \n \n \n \nMultiplier:\n \n500 V\n \n \n \n \n \nScan Range:\n \n125-800 amu\n \n \n \n \n \nIonisation Mode:\n \nElectroSpray Positive or\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nElectroSpray Negative\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAgilent 1100 LC-MS Preparative System:\n\n\n\nHardware:\n\n\nAutosampler: 1100 series “prepALS”\n\n\nPump: 1100 series “PrepPump” for preparative flow gradient and 1100 series “QuatPump” for pumping modifier in prep flow\n\n\nUV detector: 1100 series “MWD” Multi Wavelength Detector\n\n\nMS detector: 1100 series “LC-MSD VL”\n\n\nFraction Collector: 2×“Prep-FC”\n\n\nMake Up pump: “Waters RMA”\n\n\nAgilent Active Splitter\n\n\nSoftware:\n\n\nChemstation: Chem32\n\n\nAgilent MS Running Conditions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCapillary voltage:\n \n4000 V (3500 V on ES Negative)\n \n \n \n \n \nFragmentor/Gain:\n \n150/1\n \n \n \n \n \nDrying gas flow:\n \n13.0 L/min\n \n \n \n \n \nGas Temperature:\n \n350° C.\n \n \n \n \n \nNebuliser Pressure:\n \n50 psig\n \n \n \n \n \nScan Range:\n \n125-800 amu\n \n \n \n \n \nIonisation Mode:\n \nElectroSpray Positive or\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nElectroSpray Negative\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nChromatographic Conditions:\n\n\n\nColumns:\n\n\n1.

A typical routine was to run an analytical LC-MS using the type of chromatography (low or high pH) most suited for compound structure. Once the analytical trace showed good chromatography a suitable preparative method of the same type was chosen. Typical running condition for both low and high pH chromatography methods were:\n\n\nFlow rate: 24 ml/min\n\n\nGradient: Generally all gradients had an initial 0.4 min step with 95% A+5% B. Then according to analytical trace a 3.6 min gradient was chosen in order to achieve good separation (e.g. from 5% to 50% B for early retaining compounds; from 35% to 80% B for middle retaining compounds and so on)\n\n\nWash: 1.2 minute wash step was performed at the end of the gradient\n\n\nRe-equilibration: 2.1 minutes re-equilibration step was ran to prepare the system for the next run\n\n\nMake Up flow rate: 1 ml/min\n\n\n\nSolvent:\n\n\nAll compounds were usually dissolved in 100% MeOH or 100% DMSO\n\n\nFrom the information provided someone skilled in the art could purify the compounds described herein by preparative LC-MS.\n\n\nThe starting materials for each of the Examples are commercially available unless otherwise specified.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of 5-cyano-2-methoxy-N-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-benzamide\n\n\n1A.

XRPD (X-Ray Powder Diffraction)\n\n\nD5000\n\n\n\nAn XRPD study was carried out on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), θ-θ goniometer, automatic divergence and receiving slits, a graphite secondary monochromator and a scintillation counter. The data were collected over an angular range of 2° to 30° 2θ in continuous scan mode using a step size of either 0.02°2θ or 0.005°2θ and a step time of 1 second.\n\n\nSamples, run under ambient conditions, were prepared as flat plate specimens using powder as received without grinding. Approximately 25-50 mg of the sample was gently packed into 12 mm diameter, 0.5 mm deep cavity cut into a polished, zero-background (510) silicon wafer (The Gem Dugout, 1652 Princeton Drive, Pennsylvania State College, Pa. 16803, USA).\n\n\nAll XRPD analyses were performed using the Diffrac Plus XRD Commander software v2.3.1.\n\n\nBruker AXS C2 GADDS Diffractometer (used for Samples Recovered from GVS)\n\n\nX-ray powder diffraction patterns for the samples were acquired on a Bruker AXS C2 GADDS diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), automated XYZ stage, laser video microscope for auto-sample positioning and a HiStar 2-dimensional area detector. X-ray optics consists of a single Göbel multilayer mirror coupled with a pinhole collimator of 0.3 mm.\n\n\nBeam divergence, i.e. the effective size of the X-ray beam on the sample, was approximately 4 mm. A θ-θ continuous scan mode was employed with a sample to detector distance of 20 cm which gives an effective 20 range of 3.2-29.8°. A typical exposure time of a sample would be 120 s.\n\n\nSamples were prepared as flat plate specimens using powder as received without grinding. Approximately 1-2 mg of the sample was lightly pressed on a glass slide to obtain a flat surface.\n\n\nThe XRPD trace was recorded for the L-lactate salt and the free base. The traces show good signal to noise ratio, and indicate crystalline material.\n\n\nE. Gravimetric Vapour Sorption (GVS):\n\n\nAll samples were run on a Hiden IGASorp moisture sorption analyser running CFRSorp software. The sample size was ca. 10-25 mg. A moisture adsorption/desorption isotherm was performed as outlined below. The sample was loaded and unloaded at room humidity and temperature (ca. 40% RH, 25° C.) and analysed afterwards by XRPD (using a Bruker AXS C2 GADDS system).\n\n\nThe standard isotherm run was a single cycle starting at 40% RH.\n\n\nThe humidity was stepped as follows:\n\n\n40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90\n\n\n85, 75, 65, 55, 45, 35, 25, 15, 5, 0\n\n\n10, 20, 30, 40\n\n\n(i) L-Lactate Salt\n\n\nThe GVS isotherm for the L-lactate salt indicates that the sample does not display hygroscopic behaviour and does not form a hydrate. The XRPD trace for the sample following the GVS experiment is concordant with that of the input material, indicating that no phase change occurred during the experiment.\n\n\n(ii) Free Base\n\n\nDuring the experiment the sample weight differs by approximately 9% between 0% R.H and 95% R.H. This indicates that the sample is hygroscopic in nature.\n\n\nExample 69\n\n\nDetermination of the Crystal Structure of 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-Morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-Benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-Pyrazol-4-yl]-Urea dihydrate free base by X-ray diffraction\n\n\nThe crystal used for the diffraction experiment was colourless and of irregular shape with dimensions 0.2×0.2×0.2 mm\n3\n. It was obtained by precipitation of water solution of esylate salt with THF in a liquid-liquid diffusion experiment. The equivalence of such sample and the same crystal form prepared from free base (using water as anti-solvent with a range of solvents such as alcohols e.g. ethanol, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and ethers such as THF and dioxane) was established by comparison of X-ray powder diffraction pattern of both samples. Crystallographic data were collected at 101(2) K using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku rotating anode RU3HR, Osmic blue confocal optics, AFC9¼χ goniometer and a Rigaku Jupiter CCD detector. Images were collected in four ω scans, one at 2θ=30° and three scans at 2θ=90° with a detector to crystal distance of 67 mm. Data collection was controlled by CrystalClear software and images were processed and scaled by Dtrek. Although absorption coefficient was moderate (μ=0.82 mm\n−1\n) data were corrected using 4\nth \norder Fourier absorption correction to compensate for glue and crystal holder (micromount) absorption. It was found that the crystals belong to a monclinic space group P2\nl\n/n (#14) with crystal lattice parameters a=7.66(10), b=15.18(10), c=17.71(10) Å, β=98.53(2)°, α=γ=90°. The numbers in brackets represents the deviation (s.u., standard uncertainty).\n\n\nThe crystal structure was solved using direct methods implemented in SHELXS-97. Intensity data for a total of 2822 unique reflections in a resolution range from 11.5-0.89 Å (3.85<θ<60.01) were used in the refinement of 274 crystallographic parameters by SHELXL-97. Final statistical parameters were: wR2=0.2416 (all data), R\nF\n=0.0866 (data with I>2σ(I)) and goodness of fit S=1.145.\n\n\nOne molecule of free base and two water molecules were found in the asymmetric unit. The elemental composition of the asymmetric unit was C\n19\nH\n26\nN\n7\nO\n4 \nand the calculated density of the crystals is 1.36 Mg/m\n3\n. Hydrogen atoms were generated on geometrical grounds while the location of heteroatom bound hydrogen atoms was confirmed by inspection of Fo-Fc difference maps. The positional and thermal parameters of hydrogen atoms were constricted to ride on corresponding non-hydrogen atoms. The thermal motion of non-hydrogen atoms was modelled by anisotropic thermal factors (see \nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nThe crystal structure contains one intramolecular (N22-H . . . N14 2.898 Å) and seven intermolecular hydrogen bonds (see \nFIG. 2\n). 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea molecules are linked together into chains along crystallographic b axis by two H-bonds: N7-H . . . O24 2.761 Å and N25-H . . . N2 3.310 Å. Benzimidazole moieties from two chains stack together at distance of 3.5-3.6 Å. The network of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea molecules form pockets occupied by four water molecules, two and two being related by the centre of symmetry.

Water molecules are involved in mutual interaction through another two H-bonds: O1W1-H . . . O1W2 2.884 Å and O1W2-H . . .

1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base\n\n\nSamples for X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data collection were gently ground by marble mortar and loaded into a crystallographic capillary (from Hampton Research, Quartz or Glass Type 10, 0.4 or 0.7 mm diameter). Diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku rotating anode RU3HR, Osmic blue confocal optics, ¼χ goniometer and a Rigaku HTC image plate detector. 2D Images were collected while spinning φ axis with a detector to crystal distance of 250 mm. Data collection was controlled by CrystalClear software and 2D images were converted to 1D plot (2θ vs. Intensity) by Datasqueeze (intensity averaged over the azimuthal angle 0<χ<360° for 20 range 3-30° in 0.01° or 0.02° steps). In house program AstexXRPD was used for manipulation and visualisation of 1D XRPD patterns.\n\n\nThe XRPD pattern and relative intensity of peaks do not change between different crystallisation batches which is consistent with the presence of only one crystal form.\n\n\nThe XRPD pattern for the FB1 form of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base is provided in \nFIG. 3\n and details of the main peaks are listed in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2θ, d-spacing and relative intensity of main peaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2θ/°\n\n\nd/Å\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.97\n\n\n11.09\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.60\n\n\n8.35\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.87\n\n\n7.46\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.13\n\n\n7.30\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.30\n\n\n6.66\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.04\n\n\n5.89\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.97\n\n\n5.55\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.85\n\n\n5.26\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.68\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.40\n\n\n4.58\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.10\n\n\n4.42\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.40\n\n\n4.15\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.92\n\n\n4.05\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.81\n\n\n3.90\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.92\n\n\n3.72\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.62\n\n\n3.62\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.98\n\n\n3.56\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.78\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.52\n\n\n3.24\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 71\n\n\nDetermination of the crystal structure of 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-Morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-Benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-Pyrazol-4-yl]-Urea lactate salt\n\n\nA single crystal form of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea L-lactate salt has been identified. The crystal used for the diffraction experiment was a colourless prism with dimensions 0.1×0.1×0.1 mm\n3 \nobtained by evaporation from ethanol. Crystallographic data were collected at 97 K using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku rotating anode RU3HR, Osmic blue confocal optics, AFC9¼χ goniometer and a Rigaku Jupiter CCD detector. Images were collected in five ω scans, one at 2θ=15° and four scans at 2θ=90° with a detector to crystal distance of 67 mm. Data collection was controlled by CrystalClear software and images were processed and scaled by Dtrek. Although absorption coefficient was moderate (μ=0.78 mm\n−1\n) data were corrected using 4\nth \norder Fourier absorption correction to compensate for glue and crystal holder (micromount) absorption. It was found that the crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group P2\nl\n2\nl\n2\nl\n, (#19) with crystal lattice parameters a=9.94(10), b=15.03(10), c=16.18(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°. The numbers in brackets represents the deviation (s.u., standard uncertainty). One short room temperature scan was taken to check crystal lattice parameters and symmetry. It was found that symmetry is the same as at 97 (2) K and crystal lattice parameters are similar (room temperature a=10.08, b=15.22, c=16.22 Å).\n\n\nThe crystal structure was solved using direct methods implemented in SHELXS-97. Absolute configuration was selected to match L-lactate configuration used in crystallisation experiment. Intensity data for a total of 3417 unique reflections in a resolution range from 11-0.9 Å (4.01<θ<58.92) were used in the refinement of 308 crystallographic parameters by SHELXL-97. Final statistical parameters were: wR2=0.2275 (all data), R\nF\n=0.0817 (data with I>2σ(I)) and goodness of fit S=1.076.\n\n\nOne molecule of protonated free base and one L-lactate anion were found in the asymmetric unit. The elemental composition of the asymmetric unit was C\n22\nH\n29\nN\n7\nO\n5 \nand the calculated density of the crystals is 1.30 Mg/m\n3\n. Hydrogen atoms were generated on geometrical grounds while the location of heteroatom bound hydrogen atoms was confirmed by inspection of Fo-Fc difference maps. The positional and thermal parameters of hydrogen atoms were constricted to ride on corresponding non-hydrogen atoms. The thermal motion of non-hydrogen atoms was modelled by anisotropic thermal factors (see \nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\nThe crystal structure contains one intramolecular (N22-H . . . N14 2.852 Å) and seven intermolecular hydrogen bonds forming complex 3D network (see \nFIG. 5\n). Two of intermolecular H-bonds, N7-H . . . 024 2.800 Å and N25-H . . . N2 3.004 Å, link 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea molecules into chains along crystallographic c axis. L-lactate anions are linked into chains along crystallographic a axis by H-bond O3L-H . . . O1L 2.626 Å. Two bifurcated H-bonds join 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea cations and L-lactate anions. Protonated morpholine nitrogen atom interacts with both carboxyl oxygen atoms (N16-H . . . O1L 3.125 Å and N16-H . . . O\n2\nL 2.625 Å), while pyrazole N1 nitrogen is H donor to O2L and O3L (N1-H . . . O2L 2.882 Å, N1-H . . . O3L 2.740 Å).\n\n\nA thermal ellipsoid representation of the structure generated by the X-ray diffraction study is provided in \nFIG. 4\n and packing diagram is in \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\nThe coordinates for the atoms making up the structure of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea lactate salt are as set out in Table 4.

for the stability study were gently ground by marble mortar and transferred to a Petri dish in a thin layer. Samples were then placed in sealed containers containing saturated NaCl solution with an excess of undissolved NaCl. This in turn was placed into an incubator held at 40° C. to provide an environment of 40° C. and ≈75% relative humidity (RH). Samples were analysed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) in regular intervals.\n\n\nSamples for XRPD data collection were loaded into crystallographic capillary (from Hampton Research, made of Quartz, diameter=0.4 mm). Diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku rotating anode RU3HR, Osmic blue confocal optics, ¼χ goniometer and a Rigaku HTC image plate detector. 2D Images were collected while spinning φ axis with a detector to crystal distance of 250 mm. Data collection was controlled by CrystalClear software and 2D images were converted to 1D plot (2θ vs. Intensity) by Datasqueeze (intensity averaged over the azimuthal angle 0<χ<360° for 2θ range 3-30° in 0.01° steps). In house program AstexXRPD was used for manipulation and visualisation of 1D XRPD patterns.\n\n\nXRPD patterns of the lactate salt, free base (FB1) and dihydrate free base (FB2) do not change over the period of 1-2 month while exposed to 40° C. and 75% RH. The XRPD patterns of the starting and stability tested samples of lactate salt, free base (FB1) and dihydrate free base (FB2) are provided in \nFIGS. 6-8\n.\n\n\nThe XRPD pattern for the L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base is provided in \nFIG. 6\n and the details of the main peaks are listed in Table 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2Θ/°\n\n\nd/Å\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.00\n\n\n11.05\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.30\n\n\n8.58\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.50\n\n\n8.42\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.55\n\n\n7.66\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.85\n\n\n7.46\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.40\n\n\n7.13\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.90\n\n\n6.86\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.00\n\n\n6.32\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.60\n\n\n6.06\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.20\n\n\n5.83\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.60\n\n\n5.68\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.00\n\n\n5.54\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.50\n\n\n5.06\n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.30\n\n\n4.85\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.50\n\n\n4.79\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.30\n\n\n4.60\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.60\n\n\n4.53\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.40\n\n\n4.35\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.75\n\n\n4.28\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.15\n\n\n4.20\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.60\n\n\n4.11\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.85\n\n\n4.07\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.50\n\n\n3.95\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.75\n\n\n3.91\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.70\n\n\n3.75\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.15\n\n\n3.68\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.40\n\n\n3.65\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.90\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.60\n\n\n3.48\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.50\n\n\n3.36\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.30\n\n\n3.26\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28.30\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.00\n\n\n3.08\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.50\n\n\n3.03\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe XRPD pattern for the dihydrate free base FB2 form of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base is provided in \nFIG. 8\n and details on main peaks are listed in Table 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2Θ/°\n\n\nd/Å\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.50\n\n\n11.78\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.00\n\n\n8.84\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.50\n\n\n7.69\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.90\n\n\n7.43\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.80\n\n\n6.91\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.20\n\n\n6.70\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.20\n\n\n6.23\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.40\n\n\n5.75\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.20\n\n\n5.47\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.60\n\n\n5.34\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.00\n\n\n5.21\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.40\n\n\n5.09\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.00\n\n\n4.93\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.00\n\n\n4.67\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.00\n\n\n4.44\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.80\n\n\n4.27\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.15\n\n\n4.20\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.75\n\n\n4.08\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.60\n\n\n3.93\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.10\n\n\n3.85\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.55\n\n\n3.78\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.95\n\n\n3.71\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.90\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.30\n\n\n3.52\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.65\n\n\n3.34\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.00\n\n\n3.30\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.80\n\n\n3.21\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28.85\n\n\n3.09\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.35\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Activity\n\n\nExample 73\n\n\nMeasurement of Activated CDK2/CyclinA Kinase Inhibitory Activity Assay (IC\n50\n)\n\n\nCompounds of the invention were tested for kinase inhibitory activity using the following protocol.\n\n\nActivated CDK2/CyclinA (Brown et al, Nat. Cell Biol., 1, pp 438-443, 1999; Lowe, E. D., et al Biochemistry, 41, pp 15625-15634, 2002) is diluted to 125 μM in 2.5× strength assay buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 62.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 12.5 mM EDTA, 37.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 112.5 mM ATP, 2.5 mM DTT, 2.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 10 μl mixed with 10 μl of histone substrate mix (60 μl bovine histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology, 5 mg/ml), 940 μl H\n2\nO, 35 μCi γ\n33\nP-ATP) and added to 96 well plates along with 5 μl of various dilutions of the test compound in DMSO (up to 2.5%). The reaction is allowed to proceed for 2 to 4 hours before being stopped with an excess of ortho-phosphoric acid (5 μl at 2%). γ\n33\nP-ATP which remains unincorporated into the histone H1 is separated from phosphorylated histone H1 on a Millipore MAPH filter plate. The wells of the MAPH plate are wetted with 0.5% orthophosphoric acid, and then the results of the reaction are filtered with a Millipore vacuum filtration unit through the wells. Following filtration, the residue is washed twice with 200 μl of 0.5% orthophosphoric acid.

At the end of the incubation period 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue is added and incubated for a further 6 hours prior to determination of fluorescent product at 535 nM ex/590 nM em. In the case of the non-proliferating cell assay cells are maintained at confluence for 96 hour prior to the addition of inhibitor compounds for a further 72 hours. The number of viable cells is determined by Alamar Blue assay as before. In addition, any morphological changes are recorded.

The vial is then sealed and sterilised by autoclaving.\n\n\n(vii) Lyophilised Formulation I\n\n\nAliquots of formulated compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof as defined herein are put into 50 mL vials and lyophilized. During lyophilisation, the compositions are frozen using a one-step freezing protocol at (−45° C.). The temperature is raised to −10° C. for annealing, then lowered to freezing at −45° C., followed by primary drying at +25° C. for approximately 3400 minutes, followed by a secondary drying with increased steps if temperature to 50° C. The pressure during primary and secondary drying is set at 80 millitor.\n\n\n(viii) Lyophilised Formulation II\n\n\nAliquots of formulated compound of formula (I) or s salt thereof as defined herein are put into 50 mL vials and lyophilized.

The temperature is raised to −10° C. for annealing, then lowered to freezing at −45° C., followed by primary drying at +25° C. for approximately 3400 minutes, followed by a secondary drying with increased steps if temperature to 50° C. The pressure during primary and secondary drying is set at 80 millitor.\n\n\n(ix) Lyophilised Formulation for Use in i.v. Administration III\n\n\nAn aqueous buffered solution is prepared by dissolving 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea L-lactic acid salt at a concentration of 12.86 mg/ml in a 0.02M citric acid buffer corrected to a pH of 4.5 with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.\n\n\nThe buffered solution is filled, with filtration to remove particulate matter, into a container (such as a class 1 glass vial) which is then partially sealed (e.g. by means of a Florotec stopper). If the compound and formulation are sufficiently stable, the formulation is sterilised by autoclaving at 121° C. for a suitable period of time. If the formulation is not stable to autoclaving, it can be sterilised using a suitable filter and filled under sterile conditions into sterile vials. The solution is freeze dried using a suitable cycle: for example:\n\n\nFreezing—freeze to −40° C. over 2 hours and hold at −40° C. for 3 hours.\n\n\nPrimary drying ramp—40° C. to −30° C. over 8 hours and hold at −30° C. for 7 hours.\n\n\nSecondary drying—ramp to +30C over 4 hours and hold at +30° C. for 8-10 hours\n\n\nOn completion of the freeze drying cycle the vials are back filled with nitrogen to atmospheric pressure, stoppered and secured (e.g. with an aluminium crimp). For intravenous administration, the freeze dried solid can be reconstituted into a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose.

The test organisms are maintained on Sabourahd Dextrose Agar slants at 4° C. Singlet suspensions of each organism are prepared by growing the yeast overnight at 27° C. on a rotating drum in yeast-nitrogen base broth (YNB) with amino acids (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), pH 7.0 with 0.05 M morpholine propanesulphonic acid (MOPS). The suspension is then centrifuged and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl before sonicating the washed cell suspension for 4 seconds (Branson Sonifier, model 350, Danbury, Conn.). The singlet blastospores are counted in a haemocytometer and adjusted to the desired concentration in 0.85% NaCl.\n\n\nThe activity of the test compounds is determined using a modification of a broth microdilution technique. Test compounds are diluted in DMSO to a 1.0 mg/ml ratio then diluted to 64 μg/ml in YNB broth, pH 7.0 with MOPS (Fluconazole is used as the control) to provide a working solution of each compound. Using a 96-well plate, wells 1 and 3 through 12 are prepared with YNB broth, ten fold dilutions of the compound solution are made in wells 2 to 11 (concentration ranges are 64 to 0.125 μg/ml). Well 1 serves as a sterility control and blank for the spectrophotometric assays. Well 12 serves as a growth control. The microtitre plates are inoculated with 10 μl in each of well 2 to 11 (final inoculum size is 10\n4 \norganisms/ml). Inoculated plates are incubated for 48 hours at 35° C. The IC50 values are determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm (Automatic Microplate Reader, DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, Del.) after agitation of the plates for 2 minutes with a vortex-mixer (Vorte-Genie 2 Mixer, Scientific Industries, Inc., Bolemia, N.Y.). The IC50 endpoint is defined as the lowest drug concentration exhibiting approximately 50% (or more) reduction of the growth compared with the control well. With the turbidity assay this is defined as the lowest drug concentration at which turbidity in the well is <50% of the control (IC50). Minimal Cytolytic Concentrations (MCC) are determined by sub-culturing all wells from the 96-well plate onto a Sabourahd Dextrose Agar (SDA) plate, incubating for 1 to 2 days at 35° C. and then checking viability.\n\n\nExample 84\n\n\nProtocol for the Biological Evaluation of Control of In Vivo Whole Plant Fungal Infection\n\n\nCompounds of the formula (I) are dissolved in acetone, with subsequent serial dilutions in acetone to obtain a range of desired concentrations. Final treatment volumes are obtained by adding 9 volumes of 0.05% aqueous Tween-20 ™ or 0.01% Triton X-100™, depending upon the pathogen.\n\n\nThe compositions are then used to test the activity of the compounds of the invention against tomato blight (\nPhytophthora infestans\n) using the following protocol. Tomatoes (\ncultivar Rutgers\n) are grown from seed in a soil-less peat-based potting mixture until the seedlings are 10-20 cm tall. The plants are then sprayed to run-off with the test compound at a rate of 100 ppm. After 24 hours the test plants are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous sporangia suspension of \nPhytophthora infestans\n, and kept in a dew chamber overnight. The plants are then transferred to the greenhouse until disease develops on the untreated control plants.\n\n\nSimilar protocols are also used to test the activity of the compounds of the invention in combating Brown Rust of Wheat (\nPuccinia\n), Powdery Mildew of Wheat (\nErvsiphe vraminis\n), Wheat (\ncultivar Monon\n), Leaf Blotch of Wheat (\nSeptoria tritici\n), and Glume Blotch of Wheat (\nLeptosphaeria nodorum\n).\n\n\nEQUIVALENTS\n\n\nThe foregoing examples are presented for the purpose of illustrating the invention and should not be construed as imposing any limitation on the scope of the invention.

This application incorporates by reference international application number PCT/US2006/011417 by the same assignee. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/786,837, filed Mar. 29, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThis invention was made with United States Government support under National Institutes of Health SPORE \ngrant number\n 5 P50 CA092131 and Department of Defense (Army) grant number W81XWH-04-1-0129. The Government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nProstate cancer is the most common incidence of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in Western men. When the cancer is confined locally, the disease can be cured by surgery or radiation. However, 30% of such cancer relapses with distant metastatic disease and others have advanced disease at diagnoses. Advanced disease is treated by castration and/or administration of antiandrogens, the so-called androgen deprivation therapy. Castration lowers the circulating levels of androgens and reduces the activity of androgen receptor (AR). Administration of antiandrogens blocks AR function by competing away androgen binding, therefore, reducing the AR activity. Although initially effective, these treatments quickly fail and the cancer becomes hormone refractory.\n\n\nRecently, overexpression of AR has been identified and validated as a cause of hormone refractory prostate cancer. See Chen, C. D., Welsbie, D. S., Tran, C., Baek, S. H., Chen, R., Vessella, R., Rosenfeld, M. G., and Sawyers, C. L., Molecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy, Nat. Med., 10: 33-39, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Overexpression of AR is sufficient to cause progression from hormone sensitive to hormone refractory prostate cancer, suggesting that better AR inhibitors than the current drugs can slow the progression of prostate cancer. It was demonstrated that AR and its ligand binding are necessary for growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer, indicating that AR is still a target for this disease. It was also demonstrated that overexpression of AR converts anti-androgens from antagonists to agonists in hormone refractory prostate cancer (an AR antagonist inhibits AR activity and an AR agonist stimulates AR activity). Data from this work explains why castration and anti-androgens fail to prevent prostate cancer progression and reveals unrecognized properties of hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\nBicalutamide (brand name: Casodex) is the most commonly used anti-androgen. While it has an inhibitory effect on AR in hormone sensitive prostate cancer, it fails to suppress AR when cancer becomes hormone refractory. Two weaknesses of current antiandrogens are blamed for the failure to prevent prostate cancer progression from the hormone sensitive stage to the hormone refractory disease and to effectively treat hormone refractory prostate cancer. One is their weak antagonistic activities and the other is their strong agonistic activities when AR is overexpressed in hormone refractory prostate cancer. Therefore, better AR inhibitors with more potent antagonistic activities and minimal agonistic activities are needed to delay disease progression and to treat the fatal hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\nNonsteroidal anti-androgens, such as bicalutamide, have been preferred over steroidal compounds for prostate cancer because they are more selective and have fewer side effects. This class of compounds has been described in many patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,097,578, U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,981, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,654, PCT International Applications WO 97/00071 and \nWO\n 00/17163, and U.S. Published Patent Application Number 2004/0009969, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 5,434,176 includes broad claims which encompass a very large number of compounds, but synthetic routes are only presented for a small fraction of these compounds and pharmacological data are only presented for two of them, and one skilled in the art could not readily envision other specific compounds.\n\n\nBecause the mechanism of hormone refractory prostate cancer was not known, there was no biological system to test these compounds described in these patents for their effect on hormone refractory prostate cancer. Particularly, the ability of AR overexpression in hormone refractory prostate cancer to switch inhibitors from antagonists to agonists was not recognized. Some new properties of hormone refractory prostate cancer are reported in PCT applications US04/42221 and US05/05529, which are hereby incorporated by reference. PCT International Application US05/05529 presented a methodology for identifying androgen receptor antagonist and agonist characteristics of compounds. However, for each compound produced, the time consuming process of determining the antagonist and agonist characteristics of a compound must be determined. That is, there is no method to accurately predict characteristics relevant to treating prostate cancer from the chemical structure of a compound alone.\n\n\nSome compounds have been reported to be inhibitors of the ligand binding domain (LBD) androgen receptor (AR). Several have been used as drugs to treat prostate cancer, e.g., bicalutamide (Casodex). Several binders of the AR LBD have been identified, e.g., the thiohydantoins, RU59063 and BTID. (Teutsch, G.; Goubet, F.; Battmann, T.; Bonfils, A.; Bouchoux, F.; Cerede, E.; Gofflo, D.; Gaillard-Kelly. M.; Philibert. D. \nJ. Steroid Boichem. Molec. Biol. \n1994, 48, 111-119; Van Dort, M. E.; Robins, D. M.; Wayburn, B. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2000, 43, 3344-3347)\n\n\nThere is a need for new thiohydantoin compounds having desirable pharmacological properties, and synthetic pathways for preparing them. Because activities are sensitive to small structural changes, one compound may be effective in treating prostate cancer, whereas a second compound may be ineffective, even if it differs from the first compound only slightly, say by the replacement of a single substituent.\n\n\nIdentification of compounds which have high potency to antagonize the androgen activity, and which have minimal agonistic activity should overcome hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and avoid or slow down the progression of hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Therefore, there is a need in the art for the identification of selective modulators of the androgen receptor, such as modulators which are non-steroidal, non-toxic, and tissue selective.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides a series of compounds having strong antagonistic activities with minimal agonistic activities against AR. These compounds inhibit the growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\nParticular compounds of the invention include\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to any of the preceding compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\nThe invention encompasses a method for treating a hyperproliferative disorder comprising administering such a pharmaceutical composition to a subject in need of such treatment, thereby treating the hyperproliferative disorder.

A number of compounds exhibited potent antagonistic activities with minimal agonistic activities for over expressed AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\nIn Vitro Biological Assay\n\n\nEffect of Compounds on AR by a Reporter Assay\n\n\nThe compounds were subjected to tests using an artificial AR response reporter system in a hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line. In this system, the prostate cancer LNCaP cells were engineered to stably express about 5-fold higher level of AR than endogenous level. The exogenous AR has similar properties to endogenous AR in that both are stabilized by a synthetic androgen R1881. The AR-over expressed cells were also engineered to stably incorporate an AR response reporter and the reporter activity of these cells shows features of hormone refractory prostate cancer. It responds to low concentration of a synthetic androgen R1881, is inhibited only by high concentrations of bicalutamide (see Table 1), and displays agonistic activity with bicalutamide (\nFIG. 1\n and Table 2). Consistent with published data, bicalutamide inhibited AR response reporter and did not have agonistic activity in hormone sensitive prostate cancer cells (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nWe examined the antagonistic activity of the compounds for which the synthesis is described above in the presence of 100 pM of R1881. Engineered LNCaP cells (LNCaP-AR, also abbreviated LN-AR) were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two days prior to drug treatment, the cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS) to deprive of androgens. The cells were split and grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS with 100 pM of R1881 and increasing concentrations of test compounds. After two days of incubation, reporter activities were assayed.\n\n\nTable 1 lists the IC50 of these compounds to inhibit AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer. The control substance bicalutamide has an IC50 of 889 nM. Most of the compounds identified (diarylthiohydantoins) have IC50s between 100 to 200 nM in inhibiting AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer. In contrast, antiandrogenic compounds listed as examples in U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,654, such as examples 30-2, 30-3, 31-2, 31-3, and 24-3 (NC24-NC28) have no inhibitory activities on AR in this system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntagonistic activities against

refractory prostate cancer is its ability to switch antagonists to agonists. Therefore, only those compounds with minimal or no agonistic activities are qualified to be anti-androgens for this disease. To determine agonistic activities of different compounds, we examined their stimulating activities on AR using the AR response reporter as the measure in the LN-AR system in the absence of R1881. Table 2 lists the agonistic activities of different compounds. Consistent with previous results, bicalutamide activated AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer. The diarylthiohydantoin derivatives such as examples 7-3b (NC7), 33 (NC34), 34 (NC35), and 35 (NC36) have no agonistic activity.

These cells also carry a GR response reporter and the reporter activity was induced by dexamethasone, a GR agonist and the induction was blocked by RU486, a GR inhibitor. Example 7-3b (NC7) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethyl benzonitrile) had no effect on GR in this system.\n\n\nEffect of Compounds on AR by Measuring Secreted Levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n\n\nIt is well established that PSA levels are indicators of AR activities in prostate cancer. To examine if the compounds affect AR function in a physiological environment, we determined secreted levels of endogenous PSA induced by R1881 in the AR-overexpressed LNCaP cells (LNCaP-AR, also abbreviated LN-AR). The LNCaP-AR cells are a line of lymph node carcinoma of prostate cells transduced with a plasmid that makes express androgen receptors. LNCaP-AR cells were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% FBS. Two days prior to drug treatment, the cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS to deprive of androgens. The cells were split and grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS with appropriate concentrations of R1881 and the test compounds. After four days incubation, secreted PSA levels were assayed using PSA ELISA kits (American Qualex, San Clemente, Calif.)\n\n\nThe secreted PSA level of LNCaP-AR cells was strongly induced by 25 pM of R1881. In contrast, PSA was not induced in the parental LNCaP cells until concentration of R1881 reached 100 pM. This is consistent with our previous report that the AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer is hyper-sensitive to androgens. A dose-dependent inhibition on AR activity was carried out to determine the IC50s of different compounds in inhibiting PSA expression, and the results were listed in Table 1. IC50s of the selective compounds on PSA expression closely resemble those measured by the reporter assay, confirming that the diarylhydantoin derivatives are strong inhibitors of AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\nWe also examined agonistic activities of selective compounds on AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer using secreted PSA as the surrogate marker. To do this, androgen-starved AR over expressed LNCaP cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the compounds for which a synthesis is described above in the absence of R1881 and secreted PSA in the culture medium was measured 4 days later.\n\n\nTable 3 lists the agonistic activities of the selective compounds. Consistent with the results obtained from the reporter assay, the diarylthiohydantoin derivatives such as examples 7-3b (NC7), 33 (NC34), 34 (NC35), and 35 (NC36) have no agonistic activities. In contrast, RU59063, and other antiandrogenic compounds listed as examples in U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,654, such as examples 30-2 (NC24), 30-3 (NC25), and 31-2 (NC26) stimulated PSA expression in hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgonistic activities of selective test substances on endogenous PSA in hormone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrefractory prostate cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFold induction by increasing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nconcentrations of compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nName\n\n\n0.1 \nμM\n \n\n\n1 \nμM\n \n\n\n10 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDMSO\n\n\nDimethyl sulfoxide\n\n\n1.00(*)\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR1881\n\n\nMethyltrienolone\n\n\n20.69\n\n\nn/a(**)\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBicalutamide\n\n\nN-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n5.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-2-hydroxy-2-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmethylpropanamide\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n4-[3-(4-hydroxybutyl)-4,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-2-\n\n\n6.88\n\n\n11.50\n\n\n21.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComp.\n\n\nthioxoimidazolidin-1-yl]-2-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntrifluoromethylbenzonitrile\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-3b\n\n\n4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-\n\n\n1.25\n\n\n1.20\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7c)\n\n\ndiazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC7]\n\n\ntrifluoromethylbenzonitrile\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n1-[3-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-5,5-\n\n\n1.06\n\n\n1.30\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(33a)\n\n\ndimethyl-2-thioxo-1-p-tolyl-imidazolidin-4-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC34]\n\n\nylidene]-3-ethyl-thiourea\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n1-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-6-\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(34a)\n\n\nthioxo-5-p-tolyl-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-8-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC35]\n\n\nylidene]-3-phenyl-thiourea\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n1-(4-Cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-3-[7-(4-\n\n\n1.44\n\n\n1.30\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(35a)\n\n\ncyano-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-6-thioxo-5-p-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC36]\n\n\ntolyl-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-8-ylidene]-thiourea\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30-2\n\n\n4-(5-methyl-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-\n\n\n6.25\n\n\n17.95\n\n\n25.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComp.\n\n\ndiazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(30b)\n\n\ntrifluoromethylenzonitrile\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC24]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30-3\n\n\n4-(5-methyl-6,8-dioxo-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-\n\n\n7.50\n\n\n15.20\n\n\n23.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComp.\n\n\nyl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(30c)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC25]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n31-2\n\n\n4-(1-methyl-4-oxo-2-thioxo-1,3-\n\n\n8.13\n\n\n18.20\n\n\n17.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComp.\n\n\ndiazaspiro[4.4]non-3-yl)-2-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(31b)\n\n\ntrifluoromethylbenzonitrile\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NC26]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(*)Fold induction: activities induced by a specific test substance over activities in DMSO vehicle;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(**)n/a: the compound was not examined in this assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Compounds on AR Mitochondrial Activity by MTS Assay\n\n\nLNCaP-AR cells were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% FBS. The compounds were examined for their effect on growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer cells. Overexpressed LNCaP cells were used because these cells behave as hormone refractory prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (1). We measured mitochondria activity by MTS assay, a surrogate for growth. LNCaP cells with overexpressed AR (LN-AR) were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% FBS. Two days prior to drug treatment, the cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS to deprive of androgens. The cells were then split and grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS with appropriate concentrations of R1881 and increasing concentrations of the test compounds. After four days incubation, cell growth was monitored by MTS (Promega, Madison, Wis.).\n\n\nConsistent with the reporter assay and PSA assay, growth of the AR-overexpressed LNCaP was stimulated by 25 microM of R1881, but the parental cells were not stimulated until R1881 concentration reached 100 microM. \nFIG. 2\n shows the inhibitory effect of selected compounds on growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer in the presence of 100 pM of R1881. The current clinical drug bicalutamide did not inhibit hormone refractory prostate cancer. In contrast, example 5-3b (NC2) (4-[3-(4-methylphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl]-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile) and example 7-3b (NC7) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) inhibited hormone refractory prostate cancer with high potency.\n\n\nWe examined if growth inhibition in the MTS assay occurs by targeting AR, example 5-3b (NC2) (4-[3-(4-methylphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl]-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile) and example 7-3b (NC7) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) were tested in DU-145 cells, a prostate cancer cell line that lacks AR expression. These compounds had no growth inhibitory effect on DU-145 cells. The compounds did not inhibit cells other than AR-expressed prostate cancer cells, as they had no growth effect on MCF7 and SkBr3, two commonly used breast cancer cells, or 3T3, a normal mouse fibroblast cell line.\n\n\nExamples of in vitro biological activity of diarylthiohydantoin derivatives are shown in the \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n. For example, based on relative luciferase activity, \nFIG. 3\n indicates that at a concentration of 500 nM the compounds ranked, in order of most active to least active as follows: NC67>NC68>NC66>NC69>NC77=NC53>bicalutamide. For example, based on relative PSA level, it was found that at a concentration of 500 nM the compounds ranked, in order of most active to least active as follows: NC50>NC48>NC7>NC43>NC44>NC49>NC50>NC45>bicalutamide. For example, based on relative MTS units, \nFIG. 4\n indicates that at a concentration of 500 nM the compounds ranked, in order of most active to least active as follows: NC70>NC7>NC122>NC53>bicalutamide.\n\n\nInhibitory Effect on Hormone Refractory and Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Tumors\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are used to examine if the diarylhydantoin derivatives have in vivo effects on hormone refractory prostate cancer. First we examine this compound on xenograft tumors established from AR-overexpressed LNCaP cells. Engineered cells in Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical) are injected subcutaneously into the flanks of the castrated male SCID mice. Tumor size is measured weekly in three dimensions using calipers. After xenograft tumors established (tumor size at least 40 mm\n3\n), mice with tumors are randomized and treated with different doses of compounds orally once daily. The inhibitory effect on growth of AR-overexpressed LNCaP xenograft model is studied as follows. Mice with established LN-AR xenograft tumors are randomized and treated with indicated compounds orally once daily. Tumor size are measured by caliber.\n\n\nConsistent with clinical observation, current clinical drug bicalutamide did not inhibit growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer (same as vehicle). In contrast, compounds according to the invention inhibit growth of these tumors and the inhibition is dose-dependent. Furthermore, the compounds inhibit PSA expression, the clinical marker for hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are also tested in another xenograft model of hormone refractory prostate cancer, hormone refractory LAPC4. This model was established from passaging of hormone sensitive prostate cancer in castrated mice, which mimics the clinical progression of prostate cancer (2). Similar to the finding using AR-overexpressed LNCaP xenograft model, current clinical drug bicalutamide did not inhibit growth and PSA expression in hormone refractory LAPC4 xenograft model (same as vehicle). In contrast, compounds of the invention inhibited growth and PSA expression of these tumors.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n presents the results of an experiment in which cells from the LNCaP hormone sensitive model were xenografted into mice (10\n6 \ncells of LNCaP were injected into mice). A first set of mice was treated with NC53, a second set of mice was treated with Casodex, and a third set of mice was treated with vehicle solution. Each set included 6 mice. The mice were treated with 10 mg/kg per day. \nFIG. 6\n presents the results as a graph of tumor volume as a function of time. Mice treated with vehicle solution as a control exhibited the most rapid increase in tumor volume. Mice treated with Casodex and mice treated with NC53 exhibited similar rates of tumor growth, slower than mice treated with vehicle solution.\n\n\nInhibitory Effect on Growth of Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells\n\n\nTo determine if the diarylthiahydantoin derivatives also inhibit hormone sensitive prostate cancer cells, we test some selective compounds on growth of LNCaP cells by measuring MTS of mitochondria activities. Androgen starved LNCaP cells are treated with increasing concentrations of DMSO as vehicle or test substances in the presence of 1 pM of R1881. After 4 days of incubation, cell growth is measured by MTS assay. Compounds of the invention inhibit hormone sensitive prostate cancer with a higher potency than bicalutamide.\n\n\nIn Vivo Biological Assay\n\n\nAll animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the University of California at Los Angeles. Animals were bought from Taconic and maintained in a laminar flow tower in a defined flora colony. LNCaP-AR and LNCaP-vector cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. 10\n6 \ncells in 100 μl of 1:1 Matrigel to RPMI medium were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of intact or castrated male SCID mice. Tumor size was measured weekly in three dimensions (length×width×depth) using calipers. Mice were randomized to treatment groups when tumor size reached approximately 100 mm\n3\n. Drugs were given orally every day at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. To obtain pharmacodynamic readout, the animals were imaged via an optical CCD camera, 3 hours after last dose of the treatment. A ROI is drawn over the tumor for luciferase activity measurement in photon/second. The right panels were a representation of the ROIs measurements. Data are shown in \nFIGS. 7 and 8\n. Over 18 days NC53 was effective to prevent tumor growth and even to cause tumor shrinkage, and was distinctly more effective than bicalutamide.\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide, 4-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-5-yl]-toluene [NC7], N-methyl-4-{4-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-5-yl]phenyl}butanamide [NC48], and N-methyl-4-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-5-yl]-2-fluorobenzamide (52d) [NC53] were evaluated in vivo using 8 week-old FVB mice which were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were divided into groups of three for each time points. Two mice were not treated with drug and two other mice were treated with vehicle solution. Each group was treated with 10 mg per kilogram of body weight.\n\n\nThe drug was dissolved in a mixture 1:5:14 of DMSO:PEG400:H\n2\nO. (Vehicle solution) and was administered into mice through the tail vein. The animals are warmed under a heat lamp for approximately 20 minutes prior to treatment to dilate their tail vein. Each mouse was placed into a mouse restrainer (Fisher Sci. Cat# 01-288-32A) and was injected with 200 μl of drug in vehicle solution into the dilated tail vein. After drug administration, the animals were euthanized via CO\n2 \ninhalation at different timepoints: 5 nm, 30 nm, 2 h, 6 h, 16 h. Animals were immediately bleed after exposure to CO\n2 \nvia cardiac puncture (1 ml BD syringe+27G ⅝ needle). For oral dosage, the drug was dissolved in a mixture 50:10:1:989 of DMSO:Carboxymethylcellulose:Tween80:H20 before oral administration via a feeding syringe.\n\n\nThe serum samples were analyzed to determine the drug's concentration by the HPLC which (\nWaters\n 600 pump, \nWaters\n 600 controller and Waters 2487 detector) was equipped with an Alltima C18 column (3μ, 150 mm×4.6 mm). The NC7, NC48, and NC53 compounds were detected at 254 nm wave length and bicalutamide was detected at 270 nm wave length.\n\n\nThe samples for HPLC analysis were prepared according to the following procedure:\n\n\nBlood cells were separated from serum by centrifugation.\n\n\nTo 400 μl of serum were added 80 μl of a 10 μM solution of an internal standard and 520 μl of acetonitrile. Precipitation occurred.\n\n\nThe mixture was vortexed for 3 minutes and then placed under ultrasound for 30 minutes.\n\n\nThe solid particles were filtered off or were separated by centrifugation.\n\n\nThe filtrate was dried under an argon flow to dryness. The sample was reconstructed to 80 μl with acetonitrile before analyzing by HPLC to determine the drug concentration.\n\n\nStandard curve of drug was used to improve accuracy.\n\n\nThe concentration of NC53 in plasma as a function of time resulting from intravenous and from oral administration is shown in \nFIG. 9\n. The steady state concentration (Css) of bicalutanide, NC48, and NC53 is shown in Table 4. The concentration at steady state of NC53 is essentially as good as that of bicalutamide, and substantially better than NC48.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteady-state concentration of bicalutamide, NC48,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand NC53 in mice plasma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\n \n\n\nCss, 10 mg/kg\n\n\nCss, 25 mg/kg\n\n\nCss, 50 mg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n[nM]\n\n\nLogP\n\n\n[μM]\n\n\n[μM]\n\n\n[μM]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBic.\n\n\n1000\n\n\n2.91\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n11.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNC48\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n3.44\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNC53\n \n\n\n122\n\n\n3.20\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n10.7\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe androgen receptor activity can encompass several aspects of stimulation and of inhibition of androgen receptor behavior, including, but not limited to, the following: inhibitory concentration (IC50) in an AR response reporter system or a prostate specific antigen secreting system; fold induction associated with increasing concentrations in an AR response reporter system or a prostate specific antigen secreting system; associated tumor growth in an animal; the binding affinity of an androgen receptor to a compound; androgen receptor recruitment to a prostate specific antigen enhancer or a prostate specific antigen promoter; androgen receptor nuclear translocation; and destabilization of an androgen receptor protein.\n\n\nIn Vitro Assays\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n presents the relative binding affinities of compounds for the ligand binding domains of rat androgen receptor (rat AR) as determined with competitor assay kits (Invitrogen). Fluorescence polarization was used as a read-out. Each hormone dose was performed in triplicate and the relative error was determined by calculating the standard error of the three values from the mean. The study controlled for minimal competition (vehicle alone), no receptor, no fluorescent ligand, and maximal competition (10\n−5 \nM R1881, progesterone, E2 or dexamethasone). The curves were fit using a single binding site competition model (the Prism statistical analysis software package was used. R1881 had the lowest equilibrium dissociation constant, Ki=4 nM (and thus the rat androgen receptor had the highest affinity for R1881 of the four compounds tested). RU59063 had an equilibrium dissociation constant of Ki=20 nM, and NC53 had an equilibrium dissociation constant of Ki=0.8 uM. Casodex had an equilibrium dissociation constant of Ki=0.4 uM (and thus the rat androgen receptor had the lowest affinity for Casodex of the four compounds tested). NC53 and Casodex had similar equilibrium dissociation constants, and, thus, rat androgen receptor had a similar affinity for these compounds.\n\n\nNC53 prevented androgen receptor (AR) recruitment and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment to PSA enhancer and to PSA promoter. \nFIG. 11\n presents the results of the study. Materials used were Chromatin IP with AR (Upstate, cat#06-680) and Pol II (Covance, cat#MMS-126R). LNCaP (ATCC) cells were plated in full serum. On the day of the experiment, the plate was washed once with 1×PBS and 5% CSS was added for 3 days. For a first set of \nexperiments\n 10 uM of NC53 was added, for a second set of \nexperiments\n 10 uM of bicalutamide (C) was added, and for a third set of \nexperiments\n 1 nM of R1881 was added (+). Each of these compounds was added for 6 hours. In a fourth set of experiments, a control, no additional compound was added (−). 6 hours timepoint was run at 28 cycles. ChIP kits from Upstate (cat# 17-295) were used. Enhancer and promoter primers were obtained from Louie (PNAS 2003 Vol. 100, pp. 2226-2230) and Shang (Molecular Cell 2002 vol. 9, pp. 601-610), respectively. The darker image for experiments in which NC53 was added indicated that NC53 prevented androgen receptor and prevented RNA polymerase II from forming a transcription complex on the prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene. By contrast, the lighter image for experiments in which bicalutamide (Casodex, C) was added indicated that in the presence of bicalutamide androgen receptor and RNA polymerase II were still recruited to the PSA elements to transcribe PSA mRNA.\n\n\nNC53 inhibited androgen receptor nuclear translocation in LNCaP cells. \nFIGS. 12 and 13\n present the results of the study. LNCaP cells were plated in 5% CSS. A first set of cells was treated with 10 uM NC53, a second set of cells was treated with 10 uM bicalutamide (C), and a third set of cells was treated with 1 nM R1881 (+). A fourth set of cells served as a control (−). TOPO I (Santa Cruz, cat# sc-32736) was used to control for nuclear fraction, and GAPDH (Santa Cruz, cat# sc-20357) was used to control for cytoplasmic fraction. LNCaP cells were harvested for subcellular fractionation or stained with a FITC (Santa Cruz) labeled antibody against androgen receptor (AR) (Santa Cruz, cat# sc-815). From the subcellular fractionation, images were obtained, as shown in \nFIG. 12\n. The darker image in the nuclear fraction for the bicalutamide (Casodex, C) treated sample indicated that bicalutamide induced androgen receptor nuclear translocation. The light image for the NC53 treated sample indicated that NC53 abrogated nuclear translocation. For the AR-FITC assay, cover slips were mounted on glass slides using DAPI-containing medium, and cells were imaged 24 hours later using a fluorescence Nikon microscope at ×60 with filters for DAPI and FITC. In the AR-FITC assay, the nuclei of the R1881 and of the bicalutamide treated cells were distinctly green, as shown in \nFIG. 13\n indicating that nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor occurred. By contrast, the nuclei of the DMSO and of the NC53 treated cells were less green.\n\n\nNC53 destabilized androgen receptor proteins in LNCaP cells. \nFIG. 14\n shows the results of the study. The study was conducted by plating 105 LNCaP (fgc) cells in 5% CSS for 3 days. 100 pM of R1881 was added to a first set of cells (+), 10 uM of bicalutamide was added to a second set of cells (B), 10 uM of NC53 was added to a third set of cells (NC), 100 pM of R1881 and 10 uM of bicalutamide was added to a fourth set of cells (B+), and 100 pM of R1881 and 10 uM of NC53 was added to a fifth set of cells (NC+). Neither R1881, bicalutamide, nor NC53 was added to a sixth set of cells (−). The cells were allowed to reside with the added bicalutamide, NC53, and/or R1881 for 24 hours (or in the case of the (−) set, without any of these for 24 hours). In \nFIG. 14\n, the dark image for the set to which bicalutamide (B) was added and for the set to which bicalutamide and R1881 (B+) were added indicated that the androgen receptor protein was level when these combinations of compounds were added. By contrast, the light image for the set to which NC53 (NC) was added and for the set to which NC53 and R1881 (NC+) were added indicated that the addition of NC53 resulted in the degradation of androgen receptor proteins, whether or not R1881 was present.\n\n\nRanking of Compounds in Tiers\n\n\nTables 5-10 present diarylhydantoin compounds grouped into Tiers 1-6. Table 11 presents diarylhydantoin compounds which have not been placed into a tier. The placement of compounds into tiers was based on available data coupled with analytical judgment. Data considered included in vitro assays (AR response reporter system in LNCaP cell line, PSA level measurement, MTS mitochondrial assay) and in vivo experiments (tumor size measured directly or by emission induced by luciferase reporter gene, pharmacokinetic assays based on blood plasma levels). Not every compound was subjected to each assay. Not all data that was generated is shown. Judgment was applied in ranking compounds relative to each other for their utility in treating prostate cancer, in particular when ranking two compounds for which the same experiments were not performed. Characteristics considered in establishing the ranking include AR antagonism activity, lack of AR agonism in hormone refractory cells, prevention of tumor growth, tumor shrinkage, and pharmacokinetic behavior, with a longer residence time in blood being advantageous.\n\n\n \nTier\n 1\n\n\nGenerally, \nTier\n 1 compounds are diarylthiohydantoins with a disubstituted left hand aryl ring that are disubstituted on the right hydantoin carbon, and have either an oxygen or N substituent on the left hydantoin carbon. It is expected that the amido substituent hydrolyzes to an oxygen in aqueous solutions such as encountered in biological systems, in vitro and in vivo. NC63 has good activity with an iodine instead of a CF\n3 \nsubstituent on the left hand aryl ring.\n\n\n \nTier\n 1 compounds (see Table 5) were judged to be much better than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer. However, NC7 and NC48 were found to metabolize fast, that is, have a short residence time in blood. NC53 had desirable pharmacokinetics.\n\n\n \nFIG. 16\n shows that under treatment with bicalutamide, PSA levels for LNCaP cells stayed the same or increased relative to treatment with vehicle solution, whereas under treatment with NC53, PSA levels decreased. \nFIG. 17\n illustrates that under treatment with vehicle solution, tumors continued to increase in size. By contrast, under treatment with NC53 at a dose of 1 mg per kg body weight per day, the rate of tumor increase decreased, and the size of the tumor appeared to be stabilizing after about 17 days. Under treatment with NC53 at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight per day, tumor size decreased with time. \nFIG. 18\n illustrates that under treatment with NC53 at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight per day, photon emission associated with luciferase activity decreased. \nFIG. 19\n shows that treatment with NC53 at this dose resulted in a decrease or stabilization of tumor size and a decrease in photon emission associated with luciferase activity.\n\n\n \nFIG. 20\n shows that under treatment with NC53, NC54, NC55, NC56, and NC57 at doses of 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nM, PSA levels of LN-AR cells decreased. Moreover, the higher the dose, the lower the PSA level. \nFIG. 22\n presents urogenital tract weight and rate of photon emission associated with luciferase activity initially and after 14 days of treatment with bicalutamide or with NC53 for intact and castrated mice. The weight and rate of photon emission increased for both intact and castrated mice. Treatment of castrated mice with NC53 resulted in a decrease in weight and photon emission with respect to the untreated castrated mice, as did treatment with bicalutamide.\n\n\nThus, \nTier\n 1 compounds are particularly advantageous for use as AR antagonists, and as therapeutic agents for hormone refractory prostate cancer. They may be useful to treat other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. These and related compounds may also be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases.

For example, NC77 and NC53 differ only by a single fluorine substituent on an aryl ring, and NC53 is in \nTier\n 1, while NC77 is in \nTier\n 2, both being better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer, but NC53 being superior. However, NC98, which differs from NC77 only in having an additional carbon atom between the methylcarbamoyl group and the aryl ring, is no better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer and is ranked in \nTier\n 4. The effect of NC77, NC53, and NC98 on luciferase activity can be seen in \nFIG. 25\n. At a given concentration of compound, the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC77 and NC53 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC98.\n\n\nNC4 differs from NC3 only in that an amino group is substituted for a hydroxyl group. However, whereas NC3 is in \nTier\n 1, much better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer, NC4 is in \nTier\n 4, no better than bicalutamide. The effect of NC3 and NC4 on luciferase activity in the 1AR cell line was studied by administering various compounds at concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 10 μmol and observing PSA levels. For a given dose, the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC3 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC4. The effect of NC3 and NC4 on luciferase activity in the 4AR cell line was studied by administering various compounds at concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 10 μmol and observing luciferase activity. For a given dose, the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC3 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC4. The effect of NC3 and NC4 on PSA levels in the LN/AR cell line was studied by administering various compounds at concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 10 μmol and observing luciferase activity. For a given dose, the PSA level upon exposure to NC3 is less than the PSA level upon exposure to NC4.\n\n\nNC47 and NC48 differ from each other only by a methyl substituent on the end of a carbamoyl group and both compounds are ranked in \nTier\n 1, although NC48 has been found to be particularly advantageous. NC46 is the same as NC47, with the exception of a methoxy group being substituted for an amino group. However, NC46 is ranked in \nTier\n 3. NC42 is similar to NC46, but has one less carbon in the chain linking the ester group to the aryl ring; NC42 is ranked in \nTier\n 3. The effect of NC47, NC48, NC42, and NC46 on PSA levels in the LN/AR cell line was studied by administering various compounds at concentrations ranging from 125 nmol to 1000 nmol and observing PSA levels. For a given concentration, the PSA level upon exposure to NC47 and NC48 is less than the PSA level upon exposure to NC42 and NC46.\n\n\nNC68 and NC103 differ from each other in that the former has a methylcarbamoyl group attached to an aryl ring and a dimethyl substituent attached to the thiohydantoin group, whereas the latter has a methylamino group attached to the right hand aryl ring and a cyclobutyl substituent attached to the thiohydantoin group. Whereas NC68 is in \nTier\n 1, much better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer, NC103 is in \nTier\n 5, inactive or nearly inactive in the treatment of prostate cancer. The effect of NC68 and NC103 on luciferase activity in the LN/AR cell line was studied by administering various compounds at concentrations ranging from 125 nmol to 1000 nmol and observing luciferase activity. For a given concentration, the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC68 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to NC103,\n\n\nNC16 and NC18 differ from each other in the substitution of a thio for an oxo group and a dimethyl substituent for a cyclobutyl substituent. Whereas NC16 is in \nTier\n 1, NC18 is in \nTier\n 4.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are useful as pharmaceutical compositions prepared with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, as defined herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\nThe diarylhydantoin compounds of the invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject in need of treatment, for example a mammal, such as a human patient, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, for example, orally, nasally, intraperitoneally, or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes, or by injection into tissue.\n\n\nThus, diarylhydantoin compounds of the invention may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier, or by inhalation or insufflation. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The diarylhydantoin compounds may be combined with a fine inert powdered carrier and inhaled by the subject or insufflated. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% diarylhydantoin compounds. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2% to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of diarylhydantoin compounds in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. For example, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be incorporated into time release capsules, time release tablets, and time release pills.\n\n\nThe diarylhydantoin compounds may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the diarylhydantoin compounds can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations can contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the diarylhydantoin compounds which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the diarylhydantoin compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\nFor topical administration, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be applied in pure form. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Other solid carriers include nontoxic polymeric nanoparticles or microparticles. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water/alcohol/glycol blends, in which the diarylhydantoin compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the diarylhydantoin compounds to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nUseful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nFor example, the concentration of the diarylhydantoin compounds in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, can be from about 0.1-25% by weight, or from about 0.5-10% by weight. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder can be about 0.1-5% by weight, or about 0.5-2.5% by weight.\n\n\nThe amount of the diarylhydantoin compounds required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.\n\n\nEffective dosages and routes of administration of agents of the invention are conventional. The exact amount (effective dose) of the agent will vary from subject to subject, depending on, for example, the species, age, weight and general or clinical condition of the subject, the severity or mechanism of any disorder being treated, the particular agent or vehicle used, the method and scheduling of administration, and the like. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined empirically, by conventional procedures known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., \nThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, Goodman and Gilman, eds., Macmillan Publishing Co., New York. For example, an effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in suitable animal models. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration ranges and routes of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. A therapeutic dose can also be selected by analogy to dosages for comparable therapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe particular mode of administration and the dosage regimen will be selected by the attending clinician, taking into account the particulars of the case (e.g., the subject, the disease, the disease state involved, and whether the treatment is prophylactic). Treatment may involve daily or multi-daily doses of compound(s) over a period of a few days to months, or even years.\n\n\nIn general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg, e.g., from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as above about 0.1 mg per kilogram, or in a range of from about 1 to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. For example, a suitable dose may be about 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg of body weight per day.\n\n\nThe diarylhydantoin compounds are conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for example, containing 0.05 to 10000 mg, 0.5 to 10000 mg, 5 to 1000 mg, or about 100 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\nThe diarylhydantoin compounds can be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of, for example, from about 0.5 to about 75 μM, about 1 to 50 μM, about 2 to about 30 μM, or about 5 to about 25 μM. Exemplary desirable plasma concentrations include at least or no more than 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 or 200 μM. For example, plasma levels may be from about 1 to 100 micromolar or from about 10 to about 25 micromolar. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5% solution of the diarylhydantoin compounds, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a bolus containing about 1-100 mg of the diarylhydantoin compounds. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.00005-5 mg per kg body weight per hour, for example at least or no more than 0.00005, 0.0005, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg/hr. Alternatively, such levels can be obtained by intermittent infusions containing about 0.0002-20 mg per kg body weight, for example, at least or no more than 0.0002, 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, or 50 mg of the diarylhydantoin compounds per kg of body weight.\n\n\nThe diarylhydantoin compounds may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator.\n\n\nA number of the above-identified compounds exhibit little or no agonistic activities with respect to hormone refractory prostate cancer cells. Because these compounds are strong AR inhibitors, they can be used not only in treating prostate cancer, but also in treating other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. Because AR belongs to the family of nuclear receptors, these compounds may serve as scaffolds for drug synthesis targeting other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Therefore, they may be further developed for other diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases, in which nuclear receptors play a role.\n\n\nA sequence for the chemical synthesis of several compounds according to the invention is shown below. The cyanohydrins 10abc are converted into the four different cyanoamines 12abcd by reaction with the three different anilines 11abc (10a and 11a give 12a, 10b and 11a give 12b, 10c and 11b give 12c, and 10c and 11c give 12d). In a separate process the \naniline\n 13 is converted in one step into the isothiocyanate 14, Addition of 12abcd to 14 followed by treatment with mild acid produces the desired thiohydantoins 4 (NC54), 5 (NC55), 6 (NC56), and 7 in good yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe embodiments illustrated and discussed in this specification are intended only to teach those skilled in the art the best way known to the inventors to make and use the invention. Nothing in this specification should be considered as limiting the scope of the present invention. All examples presented are representative and non-limiting. The above-described embodiments of the invention may be modified or varied, without departing from the invention, as appreciated by those skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the claims and their equivalents, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."
