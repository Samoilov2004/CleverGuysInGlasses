Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to tricyclic compounds that are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders responsive to steroidal glucocorticoids, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to methods of using the compounds to treat inflammatory and immune disorders in patients, and to intermediates and processes useful in the synthesis of the compounds.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF INVENTION\n\n\nNaturally occurring as well as synthetic steroidal glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol, cortisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone) have been widely used for over fifty years for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory and immune disorders. In particular, glucocorticoids have been prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatic fever, asthma, allergic rhinitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis. However, the use of glucocorticoids is often associated with severe and sometimes irreversible side effects such as bone loss/osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, glaucoma, muscle atrophy, Cushing's syndrome, and psychosis. Thus, there remains a need for alternative therapies which possess the beneficial effects of steroidal glucocorticoids, but with a reduced likelihood or incidence of attendant side effects.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids exert their pharmacological effects by regulating gene transcription after the formation of a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This GR-glucocorticoid complex affects gene transcription by distinct mechanisms. First, following binding of the glucocorticoid, the complexed GR translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a dimer in binding to DNA glucocorticoid hormone response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of particular genes. The GR-glucocorticoid/GRE complex then, in turn, activates (transactivation) or inhibits transcription of proximally located genes. Conversely, the GR-glucocorticoid complex may negatively regulate gene transcription by a process that does not involve binding to DNA. In this process, termed transrepression, following binding of the glucocorticoid, the complexed GR enters the nucleus where it acts as a monomer to directly interact (via protein-protein interaction) with other transcription factors, repressing their ability to induce gene transcription and thus protein expression.\n\n\nThe search for GR ligands suitable as replacements for steroidal glucocorticoids is hindered by the fact that the other steroid hormone receptors, for example the androgen receptor (AR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the progesterone receptor (PR), which mediate other physiological processes, have ligand binding domains homologous to GR. As a result, GR ligands have a potential for cross reactivity with these other receptors. Thus, a desired attribute of a replacement for steroidal glucocorticoids is that it binds to GR with greater affinity relative to the other steroid hormone receptors.\n\n\nRecent insights have provided an opportunity for the identification of GR ligands with potent anti-inflammatory properties relative to their propensity for inducing side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy. Glucocorticoids have long been known to repress the endogenous production of pro-inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±).\n\n\nSignificantly, it has been reported that ligands selectively acting via the DNA-binding independent function of GR should suffice for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Reichardt et al., \nEMBO J., \n20: 7168-7173 (2001). Furthermore, many side effects of glucocorticoid therapy (e.g. hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, and muscle atrophy) are reported to be mediated by transactivational mechanisms following GR binding to DNA (see Shacke et al., \nPharmacol. \n& \nTherap., \n96(1): 23-43 (2002)). Thus, an agent which is capable of differentiating GR-mediated transrepression from GR-mediated transactivation is particularly desirable. Furthermore, an agent that displays limited capacity to modulate (i.e. agonize, partially agonize, partially antagonize, or antagonize) the transcriptional activity of the other steroid hormone receptors is also particularly desirable.\n\n\nThus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an agent which binds to GR with greater affinity relative to the other steroid hormone receptors. More particularly it is an object to provide an agent which binds to GR with 30-fold greater affinity relative to AR, MR, and PR. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an agent which possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties relative to its propensity for inducing side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy. More particularly, it is an object to provide an agent which possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties relative to its propensity for inducing bone loss or osteoporosis. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an agent which displays limited capacity to modulate the activity of other steroid hormone receptors.\n\n\nTricyclic GR modulators are known in the art. For example WO 04/052847 discloses a genus of tricyclic steroid hormone receptor modulators which are useful for treating disorders susceptible to mineralocorticoid receptor or glucocorticoid receptor modulation. WO 99/33786 discloses triphenylpropanamide-derivative compounds that bind the glucocorticoid receptor and have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt has now been found that by selecting a compound from within the scope of WO 04/052847, which is provided as Compound (I) herein below, a novel therapeutic agent has been identified which possesses a particular profile of activity that suggests it is particularly useful in the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders responsive to steroidal glucocorticoids. Accordingly, the present invention provides Compound (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((E)-N-{3-[1-(8-Chloro-11H-10-oxa-1-aza-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-propyl]-phenyl}-methanesulfonamide)\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nAs a particular embodiment, the present invention provides Compound (I) in crystalline form.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an inflammatory or immune disorder, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for treating an inflammatory or immune disorder, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the present invention provides Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in therapy.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents. As a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis comprising Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents. In addition, the present invention also provides novel intermediates and processes for the synthesis of Compound (I).\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides Compound (I) which possesses a profile of activity which makes it particularly useful in the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders responsive to steroidal glucocorticoids. As evidenced by in vitro and in vivo testing, Compound (I) binds to GR with greater affinity relative to other steroid hormone receptors and displays potent anti-inflammatory properties relative to its propensity for inducing side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy. In addition, Compound (I) displays only a limited capacity to modulate the activity of the other steroid hormone receptors AR, MR, and PR. Further still, Compound (I) possesses yet additional technical effects or advantageous properties, as further discussed herein, which address other problems in the field of patient therapy and pharmaceutical development.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides the use of Compound (I) for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders responsive to steroidal glucocorticoids. Such disorders include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatic fever, asthma, allergic rhinitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis. A particular disorder for which Compound (I) is useful is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disorder characterized by persistent joint synovial tissue inflammation with a typical age of onset between 30 and 50 years of age. RA is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis with a prevalence estimated to be about 0.8 percent of the world population, with women being twice as likely as men to develop the disease. Rindfleisch et al., \nAm. Fam. Physician, \n72(6): 1037-1047 (2005).\n\n\nThe use of Compound (I) for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders is also believed to be associated with a reduced propensity, likelihood, or incidence of side effects typically associated with glucocorticoid therapy. One such side effect of glucocorticoid therapy is bone loss/osteoporosis or glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP). GIOP is the most common cause of drug induced osteoporosis and has been reported to occur in up to fifty percent of patients undergoing chronic (i.e. lasting longer than six months) glucocorticoid therapy. Feldstein et al., \nOsteoporos. Int., \n16: 2168-2174 (2005). In particular, the use of Compound (I) is believed to be associated with a reduced propensity, likelihood, or incidence of bone loss or osteoporosis.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, this invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Compound (I) as well as solvates of the free base of Compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The term âpharmaceutically acceptable saltâ as used herein, refers to salts of Compound (I) which are substantially non-toxic to living organisms. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and methods for their preparation are conventional in the art. See for example, Stahl et al., âHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Useâ, VCHA/Wiley-VCH, (2002); Gould, P. L., âSalt selection for basic drugsâ, \nInternational Journal of Pharmaceutics, \n33: 201-217 (1986); and Bastin et al. âSalt Selection and Optimization Procedures for Pharmaceutical New Chemical Entitiesâ, \nOrganic Process Research and Development, \n4: 427-435 (2000). Particular mention is made of the hydrogen chloride salt, the hydrogen bromide salt, and the hemisulfate salt, however it is to be understood that the free base of Compound (I) is preferred.\n\n\nAs used herein the term âpatientâ refers to a human or nonhuman mammal such as a dog, cat, cow, monkey, horse, or sheep. More particularly, the term âpatientâ refers to a human. The term âtreatingâ (or âtreatâ or âtreatmentâ) as used herein includes prohibiting, preventing, restraining, slowing, stopping, or reversing the progression or severity of a symptom or disorder.\n\n\nCompound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be formulated for administration as part of a pharmaceutical composition. As such, pharmaceutical compositions comprising Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents are an important embodiment of the invention. Examples of pharmaceutical compositions and methods for their preparation are well known in the art. See, e.g. REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, A. Gennaro, et al., eds., 19\nth \ned., Mack Publishing (1995). Illustrative compositions comprising Compound (I) include, for example: Compound (I) in suspension with 1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.25% polysorbate 80, and 0.05% Antifoam 1510â¢ (Dow Corning); Compound (I) in nanosuspension with 1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.25% polysorbate 80, and 0.05% Antifoam 1510; and Compound (I) in suspension with 0.5% methylcellulose, 1% sodium lauryl sulfate, and 0.1% Antifoam 1510 in 0.01N HCl. Particular compositions comprising Compound (I) are provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound (I) formulated in Oral Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIngredient\n\n\nConcentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound (I)\n\n\n0.1 mg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHP-Î²-CD\n\n\nââ10% (w/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeppermint flavor\n\n\n0.03% (v/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWater irrigation\n\n\nUp to 100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, 50.0 g hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (HP-Î²-CD) (Roquette) is added to a 500 mL beaker followed by approximately 400 mL of water for irrigation and the mixture is magnetically stirred for about 30 minutes to dissolve the HP-Î²-CD. 50.0 mg of Compound (I), particularly in micronized form, is added to the HP-Î²-CD solution and the mixture is covered with continued stirring (approximately 2 h) to dissolve the Compound. Peppermint flavor (0.15 mL) is added to the mixture with continued stirring to disperse the flavor. The solution is transferred to a volumetric flask and additional water for irrigation is added to bring the final volume to 500 mL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound (I) formulated in Oral Suspension Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSuspensionVehicle Ingredient\n\n\nConcentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMethocel E5-LV\n\n\nâ1.5% (w/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSorbitol liquid\n\n\nââ10% (w/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSodium saccharin\n\n\n0.08% (w/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTween 80\n\n\n0.25% (w/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntifoam 1510\n\n\n0.05% (v/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeppermint flavor\n\n\n0.03% (v/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWater for irrigation\n\n\nUp to 100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, 1.25 g of Tween 80 (Fluka) is added to a 500 mL beaker followed by 7.5 g of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Methocel E5-LV, Colorcon) and 0.4 g of sodium saccharin (Sigma). Approximately 300 mL of water for irrigation is added to the beaker and the mixture is covered and magnetically stirred until contents are completely dissolved. 50.0 g of sorbitol liquid (Fluka) is weighed in a 100 mL beaker then added to the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution (the 100 mL beaker is rinsed with water and the rinse added to the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution). 0.15 mL of peppermint flavor is added to the mixture with stirring followed by 0.25 mL of Antifoam 1510 (Dow Corning) with continued stirring for about 10 min. The solution is then transferred to a 500 mL volumetric flask and additional water for irrigation is added to bring the final volume to 500 mL. The final suspension vehicle is then sealed in screw capped bottles until ready for use.\n\n\nTo prepare the suspension containing Compound (I), the required amount of Compound (I) (for example 1-200 mg, particularly in micronized form) is first added to a fresh bottle. The bulk suspension vehicle is gently shaken then 10 mL of the vehicle is added to the bottle containing Compound (I). The bottle is then sealed and shaken vigorously to disperse the Compound, then left for about 1 minute before use. Alternatively, the desired amount of Compound (I) can be added to a fresh bottle containing 10 mL of the suspension vehicle, with the bottle then being sealed and shaken as previously described.\n\n\nIt will be understood, however, that a preferred composition of the present invention comprises Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof formulated in a capsule or tablet.\n\n\nCompound (I), or compositions comprising Compound (I) can be administered by any route which makes Compound (I) bioavailable, including oral and parenteral routes. For example, Compound (I), or compositions comprising Compound (I) can be administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, transdermally, topically, intranasally, rectally, buccally, and the like. Alternatively, the compound may be administered by continuous infusion. It is understood, however, that oral administration is a preferred route of administration.\n\n\nAs used herein the term âeffective amountâ refers to the amount or dose of Compound (I) which, upon single or multiple dose administration to the patient, provides the desired effect in the patient under diagnosis or treatment. An effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by considering a number of factors such as the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree or severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; and the use of any concomitant medications. While not to be construed as limiting the present invention in any way, 1-200 mg/day represents a typical effective amount of Compound (I).\n\n\nBiological Activity:\n\n\nCompound (I) possess a particular profile of activity in in vitro tests which suggests that it is particularly suitable for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders responsive to classical glucocorticoids. For example, in radio-labeled ligand binding studies carried out in HEK293 cells expressing human GR, MR, AR and PR, Compound (I) binds to GR with a Ki of less than about 0.50 nM. Furthermore, Compound (I) binds to GR with about 30 fold or more greater affinity relative to each of MR, AR, and PR. In whole cell glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transrepression assays, carried out in human skin fibroblast CCD-39 SK cells and U937 monocytes, Compound (I) is a potent and full transrepressor (greater than about 90% maximal inhibition) of the endogenous production of IL-6 and TNFÎ±. Significantly, in a functional assay of GR-mediated transactivation, Compound (I) displays only partial agonist activity (less than about 50% maximal efficacy) in inducing GR/GRE-mediated gene transcription. Thus, Compound (I) displays a differentiated profile by inducing full GR-mediated transrepression, yet only partially inducing GR/GRE-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, in assays examining the effects on functional modulation of other steroid receptors, Compound (I) displays only limited activity in modulating gene expression mediated by AR, MR, and PR.\n\n\nIn both acute and chronic animal models of inflammation, comparing the effects of Compound (I) with a steroidal glucocorticoid, Compound (I) displays potent anti-inflammatory properties. For example, in an acute rat model of carrageenan-induced paw edema (CPE), Compound (I), upon oral administration, dose dependently inhibits carrageenan induced paw edema and inhibits production of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1Î²), a cytokine generated during the inflammatory response. These results compare favorably with the results elicited by prednisolone which was about 5 fold less potent under similar conditions.\n\n\nConversely, Compound (I) displays a reduced propensity for eliciting GR-mediated bone effects when examined in animal models of bone formation. For example, in a mouse serum osteocalcin assay comparing the effects of Compound (I) with prednisolone (at dosages approximating the respective ED50 values for Compound (I) and prednisolone in an animal model of inflammation), Compound (I) induces less reduction in the production of serum osteocalcin, a recognized marker of bone formation.\n\n\nTypical procedures for the afore-mentioned in vitro assays and in vivo animal models are provided below. As used herein, âKdâ refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant for a ligand-receptor complex; âKiâ refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant for drug-receptor complex, and is an indication of concentration of drug that will bind to half the binding sites at equilibrium; âIC50â refers to the concentration of an agent which produces 50% of the maximal inhibitory response possible for that agent or, alternatively, to the concentration of an agent which produces 50% displacement of ligand binding to the receptor; âEC50â refers to the concentration of an agent which produces 50% of the maximal response possible for that agent; and âED50â refers to the dose of an administered therapeutic agent which produces 50% the maximal response for that agent.\n\n\nNuclear Hormone Receptor Binding Assays:\n\n\nCell lysates from human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells overexpressing human GR (glucocorticoid receptor), AR (androgen receptor), MR (mineralocorticoid receptor), or PR (progesterone receptor) are used for receptor-ligand competition binding assays to determine Ki values.\n\n\nBriefly, steroid receptor competition binding assays are run in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH=7.6), 0.2 mM EDTA, 75 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 20% glycerol, 20 mM sodium molybdate, 0.2 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 20 Î¼g/mL aprotinin and 20 Î¼g/mL leupeptin. Typically, steroid receptor binding assays include radio-labeled ligands, such as 0.3 nM [\n3\nH]-dexamethasone for GR binding, 0.36 nM [\n3\nH]-methyltrienolone for AR binding, 0.25 nM [\n3\nH]-aldosterone for MR binding, and 0.29 nM [\n3\nH]-methyltrienolone for PR binding, and either 20 Î¼g 293-GR lysate, 22 Î¼g 293-AR lysate, 20 Î¼g 293-MR lysate or 40 Î¼g 293-PR lysate per well. Assays are typically run in 96-well format. Competing test compounds are added at various concentrations ranging from about 0.01 nM to 10 Î¼M. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 500 nM dexamethasone for GR binding, 500 nM aldosterone for MR binding, or 500 nM methyltrienolone for AR and PR binding. The binding reactions (140 Î¼L) are incubated overnight at 4Â° C., then 70 Î¼l of cold charcoal-dextran buffer (containing per 50 ml of assay buffer, 0.75 g of charcoal and 0.25 g of dextran) is added to each reaction. Plates are mixed for 8 minutes on an orbital shaker at 4Â° C. The plates are then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4Â° C. for 10 minutes. An aliquot of 120 Î¼L of the binding reaction mixture is then transferred to another 96-well plate and 175 Î¼L of Wallac Optiphase Hisafe 3â¢ scintillation fluid is added to each well. Plates are sealed and shaken vigorously on an orbital shaker. After an incubation of 2 hours, plates are read in a Wallac Microbeta counter.\n\n\nThe data are used to calculate an estimated IC50 and percentage inhibition at 10 Î¼M. The Kd for [\n3\nH]-dexamethasone for GR binding, [\n3\nH]-methyltrienolone for AR binding, [\n3\nH]-aldosterone for MR binding, or [\n3\nH]-methyltrienolone for PR binding, are determined by saturation binding. The IC50 values for compounds are converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\n\nBinding assay protocols similar to those described above can be readily designed by the ordinarily skilled artisan. Following procedures essentially as described above, Compound (I) displays the following receptor binding profile:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGR Ki (nM)\n\n\nAR Ki (nM)\n\n\nMR Ki (nM)\n\n\nPR Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.35\n\n\n16.20\n\n\n116.76\n\n\n31.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(Ki values represent a mean of 5 individual determinations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the ability of compounds of the present invention to modulate the activity of steroid hormone receptors (i.e. either agonize, partially agonize, partially antagonize, or antagonize), bioassays are performed which detect functional modulation of target gene expression in cells transiently transfected with a nuclear receptor protein and a hormone response element-reporter gene construct. The solvents, reagents, and ligands employed in the functional assay are readily available from commercial sources, or can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nNuclear Hormone Receptor Functional Modulation Assays:\n\n\nHuman embryonic kidney HEK293 cells are transfected with steroid hormone receptor and reporter gene plasmids using Fugeneâ¢ (Roche Diganostics) transfection reagent. Briefly, the reporter plasmid containing two copies of probasin ARE (androgen response element 5â²GGTTCTTGGAGTACT3â² (SEQ ID NO:1)) and TK(thymidine kinase) promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter cDNA, is transfected into HEK293 cells with a plasmid constitutively expressing human androgen receptor (AR) using viral CMV(cytomegalovirus) promoter. The reporter plasmid containing two copies of GRE (glucocorticoid response element 5â²TGTACAGGATGTTCTâ²3 (SEQ ID NO:2)) and TK promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter cDNA is transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing either human glucocorticoid receptor (GR), human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), or human progesterone receptor (PR) using viral CMV promoter. Cells are transfected in T150 cm flasks in DMEM media with 5% charcoal-stripped Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). After an overnight incubation, transfected cells are trypsinized, plated in 96 well dishes in DMEM media containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS, incubated for 4 hours and then exposed to various concentrations of test compounds ranging from about 0.01 nM to 10 Î¼M. In the antagonist mode for the assays, low concentrations of agonist for each respective receptor are added to the media (0.25 nM dexamethasone for GR, 0.3 nM of methyltrienolone for AR, 0.05 nM of promegestone for PR and 0.05 nM aldosterone for MR), and the ability of test compound to antagonize the agonist response is determined. After 24 hours of incubation with test compounds, cells are lysed and luciferase activity is determined using standard techniques.\n\n\nData are fitted to a four parameter-fit logistic curve fit to determine EC50 values. The percentage efficacy (compounds with saturated maximum responses) or the percent maximum stimulation (compounds with maximum responses that do not saturate) are determined relative to maximum stimulation obtained with the following reference agonists: 100 nM methyltrienolone for AR assay, with 30 nM promegestone for PR assay, with 30 nM aldosterone for MR assay and with 100 nM dexamethasone for GR assay. IC50 values may be determined similarly using antagonist mode assay data. Percent inhibitions may also be determined relative to the response in the presence of agonist alone, as described above.\n\n\nFunctional assays for nuclear hormone receptor modulation similar to those described above can be readily designed by the ordinarily skilled artisan.

IL-1Î²-Stimulated IL-6 Production in Human Skin Fibroblast CCD-39SK Cells:\n\n\n\nBriefly, human skin fibroblast CCD-39SK cells (20,000 cells/well), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Va. U.S.A. (ATCC Catalog #CRL-1501) are seeded in 96-well plates in SF-GM (MEM) medium (ATCC Catalog #30-20030), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 Î¼g/mL streptomycin and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Cells are maintained in a humidified chamber with 5% CO\n2 \nat 37Â° C. Test compounds are added to the wells in various concentrations ranging from a final concentration of about 4.65 pM to 4.64 Î¼M. 0.1 Î¼M of dexamethasone is used as a positive control. 1-hour post treatment with test compound, IL-1Î² is added at final concentration of 1 ng/mL and the reaction mixture is incubated overnight. IL-6 concentrations are measured with an ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn., U.S.A.) using standard techniques. Briefly, take 10 Î¼L of supernatant from each well and add 90 Î¼L of assay buffer. IL-6 concentrations are quantified by reading absorbance at 450 nm. A standard curve of absorbance versus IL-6 concentration is constructed and used to determine the concentration of IL-6 in experimental samples.\n\n\n2. LPS-Stimulated TNF-Î± Production in PMA-Differentiated U937 Cells:\n\n\nHuman U937 pre-monocytic cells (ATCC Catalog #CRL-1593.2) are grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC Catalog #30-2001) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To allow monocytes to differentiate to adherent macrophages, U937 cells are washed in PBS (Calcium, magnesium-free) and resuspended in fresh RPMI medium containing 20 nM phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) overnight. After differentiation, test compounds are added to the cells in the 96-well plate at various concentrations ranging from about 4.65 Î¼M to 4.64 Î¼M. 1-hour post treatment with test compound, LPS is added at final concentration of 100 ng/mL and the reaction mixture is incubated overnight.\n\n\nTNF-Î± production is measured with an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn., U.S.A.) using standard techniques. Briefly, 25 Î¼L cell-free supernatant is transferred to another 96-well plate and 75 Î¼L of assay buffer is added. TNF-Î± is quantified by reading absorbance at 450 nm. A standard curve of absorbance versus TNF-Î± concentration is constructed and used to determine the concentration of TNF-Î± in experimental samples.\n\n\nFollowing procedures essentially as described above, Compound (I) induces about 90% or more maximal inhibition of the endogenous expression of IL-6 and TNF-Î± with EC50 values of about 4.8 and 30 nM, respectively (with data from IL-6 assay representing a mean of 22 individual determinations; and data from TNF-Î± assay representing a mean of 6 individual determinations)\n\n\nAnimal Models:\n\n\n1. Carrageenan-Induced Paw Edema (CPE) Model\n\n\nCarrageenans are a group of polysaccharides which can induce an acute inflammatory response in animals. Cardinal signs of inflammation including edema, hyperalgesia and erythema are developed in the injection site immediately following injection. The CPE model (Winter et al., \nProc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. \n111, 544-547, 1962) is a recognized model of inflammation and can be used to evaluate the antinflammatory effects of glucocorticoid receptor ligands.\n\n\nTo evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of Compound (I), the Compound (I) is formulated in a vehicle comprising 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose and 0.25% Tween 80 then administered orally via gavage to male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-200 g) (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, Ind.). For comparison, prednisolone is administered orally in the same vehicle. Two hours later, 1% carrageenan in 50 Î¼L of 0.9% pyrogen free saline is injected into the subplantar regions of the right hind paw. Rats are euthanized by CO\n2 \nat 3 hours after the carrageenan injection. Paws are removed then weighed using a microbalance. Paws are then immediately immersed into liquid nitrogen until frozen. Frozen paws are dissected by making several cuts on the paw surface then centrifuged to extract the exudates. Exudate levels of IL-1Î², a cytokine generated during the inflammatory response, is then measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc., Catalog No. RLB00) using standard techniques. Total paw protein is also measured using a protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A., Catalog No. 1856210) and the absolute level of IL-1Î² is normalized to yield a concentration value of ng IL-1Î²/mg total protein.\n\n\nCompound (I) inhibits carrageenan induced paw weight gain with an ED50 of about 1.2 mg/kg. Compound (I) also reduces Paw exudate levels of IL-1Î² with an ED50 of about 0.31 mg/kg. Conversely, prednisolone treatment in this model inhibits paw weight gain with an ED50 of about 6.6 mg/kg, and reduces IL-1Î² levels with an ED50 of less than about 1 mg/kg (with ED50 values representing a mean of 5 individual determinations).\n\n\n2. Serum Osteocalcin Assay\n\n\nBone loss/osteoporosis and the resulting increased risk of fracture is a common and significant adverse effect that results from glucocorticoid therapy. Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis is believed to result, at least in part, from an inhibition of bone formation. The measurement of serum osteocalcin, a biological marker of bone synthesis, is a recognized tool for assessing the adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy on bone. (see Pearce et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrino. Metab. \n83: 801-806, (1998)).\n\n\nTo assess the effects of Compound (I) on bone formation, Compound (I) is formulated in a vehicle comprising 5% carboxymethyl cellulose and 0.25% Tween 80 and administered orally via gavage to sixteen week old male Swiss-Web mice (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, Ind.) for seven days. For comparison, prednisolone is administered orally in the same vehicle. Serum is collected 24 hours after the last dose and osteocalcin levels are determined using a competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, Mass.) modified to a 96 well format. Briefly, each well of a Multiscreenâ¢ plate (MAHV N45, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) containing 2.5 Î¼L mouse serum, 2.5 Î¼L goat anti-mouse osteocalcin, 0.625 Î¼L normal goat serum, and 119.375 Î¼L RIA buffer (0.1225 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.4, 0.025 M tetra sodium EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20) is incubated at 4Â° C. for 18 h on an orbital shaker at 80 rpm. Following the addition of 0.2 Î¼Ci/ml [\n125\nI] mouse osteocalcin in 25 Î¼l RIA buffer to each well, the plates are incubated for 24 h at 4Â° C. on an orbital shaker at 80 rpm. The complex is precipitated for 2 h at 25Â° C. by the addition of donkey anti-goat IgG (1:30) in 0.2 M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 7.4, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, 125 Î¼L/well. The precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration and washed once with 100 Î¼L/well dH\n2\nO. The filters are punched and the radioactivity quantitated on a gamma counter (Cobra II, Packard Instruments, Meriden, Conn.). Radioactivity detected on the filters from test samples is inversely proportional to serum osteocalcin concentration. A standard curve of purified mouse osteocalcin is used to calculate the serum osteocalcin concentration in test samples.\n\n\nComparing daily dosages approximating the ED50 values determined in the rat CPE model (1 mg/kg/day Compound (I) and 10 mg/kg/day prednisolone), Compound (I) induces less reduction in serum osteocalcin levels than prednisolone (with serum osteocalcin levels representing a mean of 6 individual determinations).\n\n\nAs stated, Compound (I) possess additional technical effects or advantageous properties which address other limitations in the field of patient therapy and pharmaceutical development. For example, Compound (I) displays good bioavailability and good plasma exposure following oral administration to test animals. In addition, Compound (I) shows only minor metabolism when incubated with human hepatocyte cultures in vitro. Further, metabolic profiling of rat, dog and monkey plasma, following in vivo administration of Compound (I), showed that Compound (I) was the major circulating entity, with no metabolites detected in monkey plasma. Furthermore, Compound (I) appears to be non-genotoxic when examined in in vitro assays and in vivo studies of genotxic potential. In view of these and other properties, Compound (I) is believed to be especially suitable for the treatment of chronic inflammatory or immune disorders which often require repeat or long term dosing of the therapeutic agent.\n\n\nIn addition to properties which benefit patient therapy, Compound (I) possesses yet additional advantages which facilitate its pharmaceutical development. For example, Compound (I) is capable of isolation in crystalline form. It will be appreciated that in addition to possessing desired biological properties, it is also desirable for a therapeutic agent to possess certain physical characteristics as well. In particular, compounds which are stable, crystalline solids are desired as they are particularly amenable to conventional paradigms of chemical synthesis, purification, storage, and formulation or dosage form development. âCrystalline formâ or âcrystal formâ as used herein refers to a solid form of a chemical species which has a distinct crystal arrangement that distinguishes the solid form from other forms of the same elemental composition. âSubstantially pure crystalline formâ, as used herein, refers to pure crystal form of the chemical species comprising greater than about 95% of the particular crystalline form, and preferably greater than about 98% of the particular crystalline form.\n\n\nA particular crystal form can be characterized and thus distinguished from other solid forms of the same chemical species using conventional techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), spectroscopic methods (e.g, infrared (IR) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy), and thermal techniques (e.g differential scanning caloriometry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), or differential thermal analysis (DTA)). While XRPD is a particularly useful means for characterizing crystal forms of a chemical species, it will be appreciated that the actual peak intensities in the X-ray pattern may vary from analysis to analysis of the same crystal form depending on the sample analyzed and the instrument, solvent, or procedures employed. In addition, it will also be understood that while the exact peak locations obtained from analysis of a given crystal form, as measured in Â° 2Î¸, may vary from analysis to analysis (for example Â±0.1Â°), the relative pattern of peak locations will remain essentially the same between spectra.\n\n\nThe present invention provides Compound (I) in crystalline form. More particularly, the present invention provides the free base of Compound (I) in crystalline form having characteristic peaks at Â° 2Î¸ of about 10.9, 18.8, and 22.9 (Form I in the Examples herein). In addition, the present invention provides the free base of Compound (I) in crystalline form having characteristic peaks at Â°2Î¸ of about 4.5, 9.0, 11.5, and 14.7 (Form II in the Examples herein). More particularly still, the present invention provides each of Forms I and II of Compound (I) in substantially pure crystalline form. In addition, Compound (I) is non-hygroscopic and stable under conditions of increased temperature, relative humidity, and light exposure.\n\n\nOne of skill in the art will also appreciate that particle size can affect the in vivo dissolution of a pharmaceutical agent which, in turn, can affect absorption of the agent. âParticle sizeâ as used herein, refers to the diameter of a particle of a pharmaceutical agent as determined by conventional techniques such as laser light scattering, laser diffraction, Mie scattering, sedimentation field flow fractionation, photon correlation spectroscopy, and the like. Where pharmaceutical agents have poor solubility, small or reduced particle sizes may help dissolution and, thus, increase absorption of the agent. Amidon et al., \nPharm. Research, \n12; 413-420 (1995). Methods for reducing or controlling particle size (micronization) are conventional and include ball milling, pin milling, jet milling, wet grinding, and the like. Another method for controlling particle size involves preparing the pharmaceutical agent in a nanosuspension.\n\n\nIt has been discovered that chemical preparations of Compound (I) yield crystals having particular particle sizes. In particular, samples of the free base of Compound (I), when prepared essentially according to Example 1(a) as described herein, provide an average particle size of less than 20 Î¼m and a d\n90 \nparticle size (i.e. the size of which 90% of the particles are smaller than or equal to) of less than 50 Î¼m (particle sizes determined using a Beckman Coulter LS13 320 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer). In addition, micronized samples of the free base of Compound (I), when prepared essentially as described in Examples 6 and 7 herein, provide an x\n50 \nparticle size (i.e. the size of which 50% of the particles are smaller than or equal to) of less than 10 Î¼m and an x\n90 \nparticle size (i.e. the size of which 90% of the particles are smaller than or equal to) of less than 20 Î¼m (particle sizes determined using a Sympatec (HELOS Particle Size Analysis system) laser diffraction particle size analyzer). As such, a particular embodiment of the present invention is the free base of Compound (I), or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the free base of Compound (I), wherein Compound (I) has an average particle size less than 20 Î¼m and a d\n90 \nparticle size of less than 50 Î¼m. A more particular embodiment is the free base of Compound (I), or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the free base of Compound (I), wherein Compound (I) has an average particle size less than 15 Î¼m and a d\n90 \nparticle size of less than 40 Î¼m. Even more particular is the free base of Compound (I), or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the free base of Compound (I), wherein Compound (I) has an x\n50 \nparticle size of less than 10 Î¼m and an x\n90 \nparticle size of less than 20 Î¼m. More particular still is the free base of Compound (I), or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the free base of Compound (I), wherein Compound (I) has an x\n50 \nparticle size of less than 5 Î¼m and an x\n90 \nparticle size of less than 15 Î¼m. In addition, an example of Compound (I) in nanosuspension is provided in the Examples, herein.\n\n\nMethods for preparing Compound (I) are known in the art. For example, WO 04/052847 provides general procedures which may be employed. Furthermore, WO 05/066161 provides additional general procedures which may be employed. The following Schemes, Intermediates, and Examples further illustrate the invention and represent typical syntheses of Compound (I). The reagents and starting materials are readily available to, or may be readily synthesized by, one of ordinary skill in the art. It should be understood that the Schemes, Intermediates, and Examples are set forth by way of illustration and not limitation, and that modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs used herein âDMSOâ refers to dimethyl sulfoxide; âDIADâ refers to diisopropyl azodicarboxylate; âADDPâ refers to 1,1â²-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine; âTHFâ refers to tetrahydrofuran; âDMFâ refers to dimethyl formamide; âTMSCNâ refers to trimethylsilyl cyanide; âTEAâ or âEt\n3\nNâ refers to triethylamine; âDMEâ refers to 1,2-dimethoxyethane; âAcOEtâ refers to ethyl acetate; âpyrâ refers to pyridine; âMsClâ refers to methanesulfonyl chloride âEt\n2\nNHâ refers to diethylamine; âMeOHâ refers to methanol; âPhCH\n3\nâ refers to toluene; âPhHâ refers to benzene; âPBu\n3\nâ refers to tributylphosphine; âPPh\n3\nâ refers to triphenylphosphine; âdppfâ refers to 1,1â²-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene, âNaO-t-Buâ refers to sodium tert-butoxide; âMTBEâ refers to tert-butyl methyl ether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme I is described the preparation of pyridine intermediates (5), (6), and (7). In Scheme I, Step 1,3-bromopyridine (1) is oxidized to 3-bromo-pyridine-N-oxide (2). In Scheme I, Step 2, cyanide substitution gives 3-bromo-pyridine-2-carbonitrile (3). The nitrile of formula (3) is hydrolyzed in Step 3 to the carboxylic acid and esterified with acid catalysis to the ester of formula (4). In Scheme I, Step 4, the ester is reduced to the pyridinylmethanol of formula (5) using sodium borohydride. The pyridinylmethanol is converted to the mesylate of formula (6) with methanesulfonyl chloride (Step 5) or to the pyridinylmethyl chloride of formula (7) using thionyl chloride (Step 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme II is described the synthesis of the final benzopyridyl-10-oxepine of Compound I. In Scheme II, Step 1, a modified Sandmeyer reaction of an aniline of formula (8) gives 5-chloro-2-iodophenol of formula (9).\n\n\nIn Scheme II, Step 2, a Mitsunobu reaction between 5-chloro-2-iodophenol and a pyridinylmethanol of formula (5) gives the iodoaryl ether of formula (10). Other suitable reagents include DIAD and triphenylphosphine in THF. Alternatively, in Step 3, the iodoaryl ether of formula (10) is accessed by means of alkylation with a pyridinemethyl mesylate or chloride of formula (6) or (7) using a base such as sodium t-butoxide, potassium t-butoxide, or potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as THF or acetonitrile.\n\n\nIn Scheme II, Step 4 the iodoaryl ether of formula (10) is treated with 1-butyne in a Sonagashira coupling to provide the alkynylaryl ether of formula (11). The reaction is performed using a mixture of diethylamine/acetonitrile/THF; and 1-butyne is bubbled into the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the reaction is performed using triethylamine as base and treated with 24% wt/wt solution of 1-butyne in DMF.\n\n\nIn Scheme II, Steps 5 and 6, platinum-catalyzed diboronation of the alkynylaryl ether of formula (11) gives a diboronic ester of formula (12) which forms a vinyl boronic ester of formula (13) upon an intramolecular Suzuki coupling.\n\n\nIn Scheme II, Step 7, an intermolecular Suzuki coupling between vinyl boronic ester (13) and 3-iodoaniline affords the aniline of formula (14). In order to improve purification of the aniline of formula (14), the aniline may be treated with an appropriate acid to form a salt. For example, the aniline of formula (14) may be treated with toluenesulfonic acid to provide the aniline of formula (14) as the ditoluenesulfonic acid salt.\n\n\nIn Scheme II, Step 8, the aniline is sulfonylated with methanesulfonyl chloride to give the final benzopyridyl-10-oxepin of Compound (I). Alternatively, in Scheme II, Step 9, the benzopyridyl-10-oxepin of Compound (I) is accessed directly by performing the Suzuki coupling with N-(3-iodo-phenyl)-methanesulfonamide. Compound (I) may be purified by recrystallization from, for example, methanol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme IIa is described an alternate synthesis of the alkynylaryl ether of formula (11).\n\n\nIn Scheme IIa, Step 1, 5-chloro-2-iodophenol of formula (9) is protected as the tetrahydropyran (THP) ether of formula (9a). The reaction is performed in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate. 3,4-Dihydro-2H-pyran is added at or below about 30Â° C. and then the reaction performed for 10 to 24 h at about room temperature.\n\n\nIn Scheme IIa, Step 2, the iodobenzene of formula (9a) is treated with 1-butyne in a Sonagashira coupling to provide the alkynyl benzene of formula (9b). The reaction is performed using triethylamine with an inert solvent, such as ethyl acetate, and a palladium catalyst, such as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (II), and copper (I) iodide. 1-Butyne is added at a temperature of about 0 to 10Â° C. and the reaction performed for about 10 to 24 h at about room temperature. After workup the product may be purified by silica gel chromatography and recrystillization from heptane/triethylamine.\n\n\nIn Step 3, the THP ether of formula (9b) is deprotected using acidic conditions to the alkynylphenol of formula (9c). Particular conditions use a catalytic amount of a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol. The reaction is performed for 30 min to 6 h at 0Â° C. to room temperature.\n\n\nIn Scheme IIa, Step 4, the alkynylphenol of formula (9c) is alkylated with a pyridinemethyl mesylate of formula (6), using a base such as sodium t-butoxide, potassium t-butoxide, or potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as THF or acetonitrile. Particular conditions use sodium t-butoxide in THF which is added to a solution of the mesylate and phenol at a temperature below 0Â° C., and subsequently stirred at room temperature for 24 to 72 h. After extractive workup the product is recrystillized from ethanol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme III is described an alternative synthesis of the final benzopyridyl-10-oxepine of Compound (I). In Scheme III, Step 1, a Sonagashira reaction between trimethylsilyl-(acetylene) and 3-iodonitroaniline of formula (15) affords trimethylsilyl alkyne of formula (16) which, upon desilylation, is converted to the alkyne of formula (17) in Scheme III, Step 2\n\n\nIn Scheme III, Step 3, using typical Sonagashira reaction conditions, (17) is coupled with pyridinylmethanol of formula (18) to give the diaryl alkyne of formula (19). In Scheme III, Step 4, a Mitsonobu reaction between the diaryl alkyne (19) and 5-chloro-2-iodophenol of formula (9) affords the biaryl alkynyl iodoaryl ether of formula (20). Typical conditions include triphenylphosphine and DIAD in methylene chloride.\n\n\nIn Scheme III, Step 5, biaryl alkynyl iodoaryl (20) is converted to pyridyl oxepine of formula (21) in the presence of trimeric vinyl boronic anhydride via a palladium-catalyzed intramolecular Heck-Suzuki cascade reaction. Optimized conditions include slow addition of the boronic anhydride to a mixture of biaryl alkynyl iodoaryl (20), 2 mol % palladium (II) acetate, 2 equiv of sodium carbonate in 4:1 by vol of DME:water at 90Â° C.\n\n\nIn Scheme III, Step 6, a one-pot hydrogenation on Pd/C of both the double bond and nitro group of pyridyl oxepine (21) yields the aniline of formula (14). In Scheme III, Step 7, the aniline is sulfonylated with methanesulfonlyl chloride using pyridine base to give the final benzopyridyl-10-oxepine of Compound (I).\n\n\nInstrumental Analysis\n\n\nGC-MS analysis may be carried out on an HP 6890 Series GC-MS (70 eV) equipped with an Agilent 0.25-mmÃ15-mÃ0.25 Î¼m capillary column using temperature programming (60-280Â° C. in 7.3 min then 280Â° C. for 2 min) LC-MS analysis may be performed on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC using a Waters Xterraâ¢ MS C\n18 \n4.6-mmÃ50-mm 3 5-Î¼m column and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI).

Differential thermal analyses (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) may be carried out on a Mettler Toledo DTA and TGA unit (Model TGA/SDTA 851). Samples are heated in sealed aluminum pans with a pinhole from 25 to 300-350Â° C. at 10Â° C./min with a nitrogen purge of 50 ml/min.

A solution of sodium nitrite (1082 g) in water (6 L) is added dropwise maintaining the temperature â¦0Â° C. over one hour and 45 min. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for a minimum of one hour at a temperature of â¦0Â° C. A 50 L three neck round bottom flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, nitrogen inlet, and thermocouple placed in a heating mantle. Potassium iodide (6.9 kg) and water (7.5 L) are charged to the flask, stirring is initiated and the reaction heated to 48 to 50Â° C. 2-Amino-5-chlorophenol diazotized solution is charged to the flask in portions maintaining the temperature at 48 to 50Â° C., using two condensers to vent the gases. The reaction mixture is heated for 2 h at 48 to 50Â° C. After this time the heating is stopped and the reaction is stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (heptane:EtOAc, 9:1). The starting material is observed at R\nf\n=0.3 and product at R\nf\n=0.6. The reaction is deemed complete when no starting material is observed. Once the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is diluted with MTBE (16 L) and stirred for 20 min. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated from the aqueous layer. The organic layer is washed with a solution of Na\n2\nS\n2\nO\n3 \n(3 kg) and water (12 L) and stirred for 5-10 min. The organic layer is separated and the same washing sequence repeated twice more. The organic layer is separated from the aqueous layers and all aqueous washes are discarded. The organic layer is washed with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (4 L). The organic layer is separated from the aqueous layer and the organic layer is washed with brine (4 L). The organic layer is separated and dried over magnesium sulfate, treated with charcoal, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting residue is co-evaporated with heptane (1 L) using an oil pump to remove residual solvents. The residual brown oil (2880 g) is dissolved in heptane (1 mL/g) and the solution is placed in a freezer overnight.

The flask is charged with 3-bromopyridine (3169 g, 20 mol), dichloromethane (8.2 L) and methyltrioxorhenium (10 g). The reaction mixture is cooled to 18Â° C. using a cold tap water bath and 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (3.07 L, 30 mol) is added in portions over about 15 min. The reaction is slightly exothermic and ice is added to the cooling tub in order to maintain the temperature at 20-25Â° C. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir overnight in a bath at room temperature (do not empty the bath). The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (heptane:EtOAc, 1:1) Starting 3-bromopyridine is observed to have an R\nf\n=0.6 and product R\nf\n=0.1. Traces of starting material may be present after overnight stirring and the reaction can either be worked up or stirred for an additional 8-24 h. Once the reaction is deemed complete, manganese dioxide (31 g, <10 microns) is added in small portions at a rate to control foaming and maintain the temperature at 20-25Â° C. Ice may be added to the cooling water tub if the temperature goes higher. If foaming is observed, more manganese dioxide may be added. When no more foaming is observed after addition of a fresh portion of manganese dioxide, solid sodium chloride (860 g) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3Ã2.5 L). The extractions from each organic layer may be monitored using TLC. If product is present after last extraction, the aqueous layer may be filtered, then additional sodium chloride (500 g) may be added, and the mixture stirred to dissolve the salt. The aqueous layer is then extracted with dichloromethane (3Ã2 L). The combined organic portion is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. A pale yellow oil resides in the flask.

The reaction mixture is heated to a gentle reflux of about 70-73Â° C., then neat trimethyl silylcyanide (6.667 L, 50 mol) is added via the addition funnel in 10-15 minute intervals, over a total of 3 h. After addition of each portion of trimethyl silylcyanide, the reaction proceeds toward strong reflux (if vapors escape, additional trimethylsilylcyanide may be needed to drive the reaction to completion). Once the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at reflux for 20 h with adjustment of heating rate as necessary to maintain the reflux. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (heptane EtOAc 1:1). Once the reaction is deemed complete the reaction mixture is cooled to 0-10Â° C. A solution of 50% aqueous NaOH (7.2 kg) in water (9 L) is added in a stream over 30 min and an exotherm results. The temperature rises to 20-25Â° C. and the reaction is stirred for 30 min at 15-25Â° C. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. The organic layer is washed with brine (4 L) and the combined aqueous layers are extracted with EtOAc (3Ã3 L). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (3 L), treated with charcoal, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting solids (about 3.8 kg) are dissolved in EtOAc (25 L, using some heat), dried over magnesium sulfate, charcoal, filtered and concentrated. The resulting tan/brown solids are dissolved in ethanol (7 L) with heating. The resulting solution is transferred to a pail and allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. After this time the solids are collected by filtration and washed with cold ethanol on a filter (2Ã1 L, â20Â° C.).

The reaction mixture is cooled to â5 to 5Â° C. using MeOH/dry ice baths, with the dry ice being added in portions while being careful not to overcool. Sodium borohydride (about 1651 g, 43.64 mol) is charged to each flask in 100 g portions, maintaining the temperature at â5 to 5Â° C. and allowing the temperature to stabilize before adding each portion. After the addition is complete, the MeOH baths are replaced with ice water. The reaction mixture is stirred for 6-8 h at 0-5Â° C., being careful to maintain the temperature at 0-5Â° C. with the addition of ice to the baths as necessary. The reaction progress is monitored by TLC (heptane:EtOAc, 1:1). No starting material should be present at R\nf\n=0.6 and product is observed at R\nf\n=0.1-0.5. Once the reaction is deemed complete, the ice water baths are replaced with ice/MeOH or MeOH/dry ice baths. Acetone is added (4.5 L to each flask) at such a rate to maintain the temperature below 10Â° C. for the first half of addition and at 10-20Â° C. for the second part. Once the acetone addition is complete, the reaction may be left to stir overnight in an ice water bath or proceed to work up. Each reaction mixture is diluted with water (5 L to each flask) and the reaction mixture is concentrated to almost dryness.

The cooling coil is maintained in a water bath kept at a temperature of 20-30Â° C. except for brief excursions as low as 14Â° C. and as high as 39Â° C. The pressure gauge is set at 100 psi (about 6.89 bar) which applies a pressure of 23,000 psi on the formulation. The formulation is contained in a 1 L hopper and is drawn into the Microfluidizer from the bottom of the hopper and returned to the top of the liquid in the hopper through the product drain and a length of silicone tubing. The formulation is also stirred in the hopper with standard propeller mixer. The entire volume of the formulation is passed through the interaction chamber 81 times. The final particle size of Compound I in the nanosuspension formulation is determined using a Horiba LA-920 particle size analyzer: average particle size: 0.430 Î¼m; d90 particle size: 0.594 Î¼m."
