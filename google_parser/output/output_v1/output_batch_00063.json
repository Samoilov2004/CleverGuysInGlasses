In certain embodiments, these cyclodextrin-containing polymers improve drug stability and/or solubility, and/or reduce toxicity, and/or improve efficacy of the topoisomerase inhibitor when used in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, by selecting from a variety of linker groups that link or couple CDP to a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, and/or targeting ligands, the rate of drug release from the polymers can be attenuated for controlled delivery. The invention also relates to methods of treating subjects with compositions described herein. The invention further relates to methods for conducting a pharmaceutical business comprising manufacturing, licensing, or distributing kits containing or relating to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, the present invention provides water-soluble, biocompatible polymer conjugates comprising a water-soluble, biocompatible polymer covalently attached to the topoisomerase inhibitor through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric conjugates featured in the methods described herein may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of a bioactive/therapeutic agent, such as camptothecin, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the agent from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve drug half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize drug metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative. The term “camptothecin derivative”, as used herein, includes camptothecin analogues and metabolites of camptothecin.

In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitors, or targeting ligands make up at least about 1%, 5%, 10% or 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% or even 35% of the CDP by weight. Number-average molecular weight (M\nn\n) may also vary widely, but generally fall in the range of about 1,000 to about 500,000 daltons, preferably from about 5000 to about 200,000 daltons and, even more preferably, from about 10,000 to about 100,000.

Within a given sample of a subject polymer, a wide range of molecular weights may be present. For example, molecules within the sample may have molecular weights that differ by a factor of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or more, or that differ from the average molecular weight by a factor of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or more. Exemplary cyclodextrin moieties include cyclic structures consisting essentially of from 7 to 9 saccharide moieties, such as cyclodextrin and oxidized cyclodextrin. A cyclodextrin moiety optionally comprises a linker moiety that forms a covalent linkage between the cyclic structure and the polymer backbone, preferably having from 1 to 20 atoms in the chain, such as alkyl chains, including dicarboxylic acid derivatives (such as glutaric acid derivatives, succinic acid derivatives, and the like), and heteroalkyl chains, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclodextrins are cyclic polysaccharides containing naturally occurring D-(+)-glucopyranose units in an α-(1,4) linkage. The most common cyclodextrins are alpha ((α)-cyclodextrins, beta (β)-cyclodextrins and gamma (γ)-cyclodextrins which contain, respectively six, seven, or eight glucopyranose units. Structurally, the cyclic nature of a cyclodextrin forms a torus or donut-like shape having an inner apolar or hydrophobic cavity, the secondary hydroxyl groups situated on one side of the cyclodextrin torus and the primary hydroxyl groups situated on the other. Thus, using (β)-cyclodextrin as an example, a cyclodextrin is often represented schematically as shown in \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side on which the secondary hydroxyl groups are located has a wider diameter than the side on which the primary hydroxyl groups are located. The present invention contemplates covalent linkages to cyclodextrin moieties on the primary and/or secondary hydroxyl groups.

In certain such embodiments, the self-cyclizing moiety cyclizes to form an imidazolidone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the self-cyclizing moiety has a structure\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nU is selected from NR\n1 \nand S;\n\n\nX is selected from O, NR\n5\n, and S, preferably O or S;\n\n\nV is selected from O, S and NR\n4\n, preferably O or NR\n4\n;\n\n\nR\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and alkoxy; or R\n2 \nand R\n3 \ntogether with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a ring; and\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n4\n, and R\n5 \nare independently selected from hydrogen and alkyl.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, U is NR\n1 \nand/or V is NR\n4\n, and R\n1 \nand R\n4 \nare independently selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl. In certain embodiments, both R\n1 \nand R\n4 \nare methyl. On certain embodiments, both R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare hydrogen. In certain embodiments R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently alkyl, preferably lower alkyl. In certain embodiments, R\n2 \nand R\n3 \ntogether are —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n— wherein n is 3 or 4, thereby forming a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring. In certain embodiments, the nature of R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nmay affect the rate of cyclization of the self-cyclizing moiety. In certain such embodiments, it would be expected that the rate of cyclization would be greater when R\n2 \nand R\n3 \ntogether with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a ring than the rate when R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and alkoxy. In certain embodiments, U is bonded to the self-cyclizing moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the self-cyclizing moiety is selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety may connect to the self-cyclizing moiety through carbonyl-heteroatom bonds, e.g., amide, carbamate, carbonate, ester, thioester, and urea bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a topoisomerase inhibitor is covalently attached to a polymer through a tether, wherein the tether comprises a selectivity-determining moiety and a self-cyclizing moiety which are covalently attached to one another. In certain embodiments, the self-cyclizing moiety is selected such that after cleavage of the bond between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety, cyclization of the self-cyclizing moiety occurs, thereby releasing the therapeutic agent. As an illustration, ABC may be a selectivity-determining moiety, and DEFGH maybe be a self-cyclizing moiety, and ABC may be selected such that enzyme Y cleaves between C and D. Once cleavage of the bond between C and D progresses to a certain point, D will cyclize onto H, thereby releasing topoisomerase inhibitor X, or a prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, topoisomerase inhibitor X may further comprise additional intervening components, including, but not limited to another self-cyclizing moiety or a leaving group linker, such as CO\n2 \nor methoxymethyl, that spontaneously dissociates from the remainder of the molecule after cleavage occurs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker may be and/or comprise an alkylene chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, polysuccinic anhydride, poly-L-glutamic acid, poly(ethyleneimine), an oligosaccharide, an amino acid (e.g., glycine or cysteine), an amino acid chain, or any other suitable linkage. In certain embodiments, the linker group itself can be stable under physiological conditions, such as an alkylene chain, or it can be cleavable under physiological conditions, such as by an enzyme (e.g., the linkage contains a peptide sequence that is a substrate for a peptidase), or by hydrolysis (e.g., the linkage contains a hydrolyzable group, such as an ester or thioester). The linker groups can be biologically inactive, such as a PEG, polyglycolic acid, or polylactic acid chain, or can be biologically active, such as an oligo- or polypeptide that, when cleaved from the moieties, binds a receptor, deactivates an enzyme, etc. Various oligomeric linker groups that are biologically compatible and/or bioerodible are known in the art, and the selection of the linkage may influence the ultimate properties of the material, such as whether it is durable when implanted, whether it gradually deforms or shrinks after implantation, or whether it gradually degrades and is absorbed by the body. The linker group may be attached to the moieties by any suitable bond or functional group, including carbon-carbon bonds, esters, ethers, amides, amines, carbonates, carbamates, sulfonamides, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker group(s) of the present invention represent a hydrocarbylene group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —OC(O)—, —C(═O)O, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, represents H or a lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker group represents a derivatized or non-derivatized amino acid (e.g., glycine or cysteine). In certain embodiments, linker groups with one or more terminal carboxyl groups may be conjugated to the polymer. In certain embodiments, one or more of these terminal carboxyl groups may be capped by covalently attaching them to a therapeutic agent, a targeting moiety, or a cyclodextrin moiety via an (thio)ester or amide bond. In still other embodiments, linker groups with one or more terminal hydroxyl, thiol, or amino groups may be incorporated into the polymer. In preferred embodiments, one or more of these terminal hydroxyl groups may be capped by covalently attaching them to a therapeutic agent, a targeting moiety, or a cyclodextrin moiety via an (thio)ester, amide, carbonate, carbamate, thiocarbonate, or thiocarbamate bond. In certain embodiments, these (thio)ester, amide, (thio)carbonate or (thio)carbamates bonds may be biohydrolyzable, i.e., capable of being hydrolyzed under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a linker group represents a hydrocarbylene group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —C(═O)O, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, represents H or a lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a self-cyclizing moiety.

In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety is a moiety that promotes selectivity in the cleavage of the bond between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Such a moiety may, for example, promote enzymatic cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Alternatively, such a moiety may promote cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety under acidic conditions or basic conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may comprise a self-cyclizing moiety or a selectivity-determining moiety, or both. In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety may be bonded to the self-cyclizing moiety between the self-cyclizing moiety and the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be or include an alkyl chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, polysuccinic anhydride, poly-L-glutamic acid, poly(ethyleneimine), an oligosaccharide, an amino acid chain, or any other suitable linkage. In certain embodiments, the linker group itself can be stable under physiological conditions, such as an alkyl chain, or it can be cleavable under physiological conditions, such as by an enzyme (e.g., the linkage contains a peptide sequence that is a substrate for a peptidase), or by hydrolysis (e.g., the linkage contains a hydrolyzable group, such as an ester or thioester). The linker groups can be biologically inactive, such as a PEG, polyglycolic acid, or polylactic acid chain, or can be biologically active, such as an oligo- or polypeptide that, when cleaved from the moieties, binds a receptor, deactivates an enzyme, etc. Various oligomeric linker groups that are biologically compatible and/or bioerodible are known in the art, and the selection of the linkage may influence the ultimate properties of the material, such as whether it is durable when implanted, whether it gradually deforms or shrinks after implantation, or whether it gradually degrades and is absorbed by the body. The linker group may be attached to the moieties by any suitable bond or functional group, including carbon-carbon bonds, esters, ethers, amides, amines, carbonates, carbamates, sulfonamides, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be an alkyl group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from aryl, heteroaryl, carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —OC(O)—, —C(═O)O—, —NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n—, NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, is H or lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates a CDP, wherein a plurality of topoisomerase inhibitors are covalently attached to the polymer through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the therapeutic agents as discussed above, wherein administration of the polymer to a subject results in release of the therapeutic agent over a period of at least 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 24, 36, 48 or even 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the conjugation of the topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP improves the aqueous solubility of the topoisomerase inhibitor and hence the bioavailability. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the topoisomerase inhibitor has a log P>0.4, >0.6, >0.8, >1, >2, >3, >4, or even >5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate of the present invention preferably has a molecular weight in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates attenuating the rate of release of the topoisomerase inhibitor by introducing various tether and/or linking groups between the therapeutic agent and the polymer. Thus, in certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates of the present invention are compositions for controlled delivery of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugate Characteristics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP and/or CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition as described herein have polydispersities less than about 3, or even less than about 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention provides an improved delivery of certain topoisomerase inhibitor by covalently attaching one or more topoisomerase inhibitors to a CDP. Such conjugation can improve the aqueous solubility and hence the bioavailability of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein preferably have molecular weights in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the compound has a number average (M\nn\n) molecular weight between 1,000 to 500,000 amu, or between 5,000 to 200,000 amu, or between 10,000 to 100,000 amu. One method to determine molecular weight is by gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”), e.g., mixed bed columns, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nsolvent, light scattering detector, and off-line do/dc. Other methods are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is biodegradable or bioerodable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative, or prodrug thereof makes up at least 3% (e.g., at least about 5%) by weight of the polymer. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 20% by weight of the compound. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 5%, 10%, 15%, or at least 20% by weight of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of the topoisomerase inhibitor, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the topoisomerase inhibitor from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve topoisomerase inhibitor half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize topoisomerase inhibitor metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be a flexible or flowable material. When the CDP used is itself flowable, the CDP composition of the invention, even when viscous, need not include a biocompatible solvent to be flowable, although trace or residual amounts of biocompatible solvents may still be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it is possible that the biodegradable polymer or the biologically active agent may be dissolved in a small quantity of a solvent that is non-toxic to more efficiently produce an amorphous, monolithic distribution or a fine dispersion of the biologically active agent in the flexible or flowable composition, it is an advantage of the invention that, in a preferred embodiment, no solvent is needed to form a flowable composition. Moreover, the use of solvents is preferably avoided because, once a polymer composition containing solvent is placed totally or partially within the body, the solvent dissipates or diffuses away from the polymer and must be processed and eliminated by the body, placing an extra burden on the body's clearance ability at a time when the illness (and/or other treatments for the illness) may have already deleteriously affected it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, when a solvent is used to facilitate mixing or to maintain the flowability of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, it should be non-toxic, otherwise biocompatible, and should be used in relatively small amounts. Solvents that are toxic should not be used in any material to be placed even partially within a living body. Such a solvent also must not cause substantial tissue irritation or necrosis at the site of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable biocompatible solvents, when used, include N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, ethanol, propylene glycol, acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, oleic acid, or 1-dodecylazacylcoheptanone. Preferred solvents include N-methylpyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetone because of their solvating ability and their biocompatibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are soluble in one or more common organic solvents for ease of fabrication and processing. Common organic solvents include such solvents as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, 2-butanone, butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein, upon contact with body fluids, undergo gradual degradation. The life of a biodegradable polymer in vivo depends upon, among other things, its molecular weight, crystallinity, biostability, and the degree of crosslinking. In general, the greater the molecular weight, the higher the degree of crystallinity, and the greater the biostability, the slower biodegradation will be.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a subject composition is formulated with a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material, release of the topoisomerase inhibitor or other material for a sustained or extended period as compared to the release from an isotonic saline solution generally results. Such release profile may result in prolonged delivery (over, say 1 to about 2,000 hours, or alternatively about 2 to about 800 hours) of effective amounts (e.g., about 0.0001 mg/kg/hour to about 10 mg/kg/hour, e.g., 0.001 mg/kg/hour, 0.01 mg/kg/hour, 0.1 mg/kg/hour, 1.0 mg/kg/hour) of the topoisomerase inhibitor or any other material associated with the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of factors may affect the desired rate of hydrolysis of CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions, the desired softness and flexibility of the resulting solid matrix, rate and extent of bioactive material release. Some of such factors include the selection/identity of the various subunits, the enantiomeric or diastereomeric purity of the monomeric subunits, homogeneity of subunits found in the polymer, and the length of the polymer. For instance, the present invention contemplates heteropolymers with varying linkages, and/or the inclusion of other monomeric elements in the polymer, in order to control, for example, the rate of biodegradation of the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo illustrate further, a wide range of degradation rates may be obtained by adjusting the hydrophobicities of the backbones or side chains of the polymers while still maintaining sufficient biodegradability for the use intended for any such polymer. Such a result may be achieved by varying the various functional groups of the polymer. For example, the combination of a hydrophobic backbone and a hydrophilic linkage produces heterogeneous degradation because cleavage is encouraged whereas water penetration is resisted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne protocol generally accepted in the field that may be used to determine the release rate of a therapeutic agent such as a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material loaded in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles or compositions of the present invention involves degradation of any such matrix in a 0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37° C., an assay known in the art. For purposes of the present invention, the term “PBS protocol” is used herein to refer to such protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the release rates of different CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be compared by subjecting them to such a protocol. In certain instances, it may be necessary to process polymeric systems in the same fashion to allow direct and relatively accurate comparisons of different systems to be made. For example, the present invention teaches several different methods of formulating the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions. Such comparisons may indicate that any one CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition releases incorporated material at a rate from about 2 or less to about 1000 or more times faster than another polymeric system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a comparison may reveal a rate difference of about 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 750 times. Even higher rate differences are contemplated by the present invention and release rate protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, when formulated in a certain manner, the release rate for CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may present as mono- or bi-phasic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelease of any material incorporated into the polymer matrix, which is often provided as a microsphere, may be characterized in certain instances by an initial increased release rate, which may release from about 5 to about 50% or more of any incorporated material, or alternatively about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40%, followed by a release rate of lesser magnitude.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe release rate of any incorporated material may also be characterized by the amount of such material released per day per mg of polymer matrix. For example, in certain embodiments, the release rate may vary from about 1 ng or less of any incorporated material per day per mg of polymeric system to about 500 or more ng/day/mg. Alternatively, the release rate may be about 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 ng/day/mg. In still other embodiments, the release rate of any incorporated material may be 10,000 ng/day/mg, or even higher. In certain instances, materials incorporated and characterized by such release rate protocols may include therapeutic agents, fillers, and other substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the rate of release of any material from any CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition of the present invention may be presented as the half-life of such material in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the embodiment involving protocols for in vitro determination of release rates, in vivo protocols, whereby in certain instances release rates for polymeric systems may be determined in vivo, are also contemplated by the present invention. Other assays useful for determining the release of any material from the polymers of the present system are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysical Structures of the CDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugates, Particles and Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions may be formed in a variety of shapes. For example, in certain embodiments, CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates may be presented in the form of microparticles or nanoparticles. Microspheres typically comprise a biodegradable polymer matrix incorporating a drug. Microspheres can be formed by a wide variety of techniques known to those of skill in the art. Examples of microsphere forming techniques include, but are not limited to, (a) phase separation by emulsification and subsequent organic solvent evaporation (including complex emulsion methods such as oil in water emulsions, water in oil emulsions and water-oil-water emulsions); (b) coacervation-phase separation; (c) melt dispersion; (d) interfacial deposition; (e) in situ polymerization; (f) spray drying and spray congealing; (g) air suspension coating; and (h) pan and spray coating. These methods, as well as properties and characteristics of microspheres are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,438,253; U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,441; U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,669; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,768; U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,110; U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,175; and European Patent 0258780, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare microspheres, several methods can be employed depending upon the desired application of the delivery vehicles. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying, milling, co-precipitation and critical fluid extraction. In the case of spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying and critical fluid extraction; the components (stabilizing polyol, bioactive material, buffers, etc.) are first dissolved or suspended in aqueous conditions. In the case of milling, the components are mixed in the dried form and milled by any method known in the art. In the case of co-precipitation, the components are mixed in organic conditions and processed as described below. Spray drying can be used to load the stabilizing polyol with the bioactive material. The components are mixed under aqueous conditions and dried using precision nozzles to produce extremely uniform droplets in a drying chamber. Suitable spray drying machines include, but are not limited to, Buchi, NIRO, APV and Lab-plant spray driers used according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe shape of microparticles and nanoparticles may be determined by scanning electron microscopy. Spherically shaped nanoparticles are used in certain embodiments, for circulation through the bloodstream. If desired, the particles may be fabricated using known techniques into other shapes that are more useful for a specific application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to intracellular delivery of a topoisomerase inhibitor, it also possible that particles of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, such as microparticles or nanoparticles, may undergo endocytosis, thereby obtaining access to the cell. The frequency of such an endocytosis process will likely depend on the size of any particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the surface charge of the molecule is neutral, or slightly negative. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the particle surface is from about −80 mV to about 50 mV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticles: Conjugate Number\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugate number, as used herein, is the number of cyclodextrin containing polymer (“CDP”) therapeutic agent conjugate molecules (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates), present in a particle or nanoparticle. For purposes of determining conjugate number, a particle or nanoparticle is an entity having one, or typically, more than one CDP therapeutic agent conjugate molecules molecules (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates), which, at the concentration suitable for administration to humans, behaves as a single unit in any of water, e.g., water at neutral pH, PBS, e.g., PBS at pH 7.4, or in a formulation in which it will be administered to patients. For purposes of calculating conjugate number, a CDP therapeutic agent conjugate molecule molecules (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate) is a single CDP polymer with its covalently linked therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods disclosed herein, provide for evaluating a particle, e.g., a nanoparticle, or preparation of particles, e.g., nanoparticles, wherein said particles, e.g., nanoparticles, comprise a CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate). Generally, the method comprises providing a sample comprising a plurality of said particles, e.g., nanoparticles, determining a value for the number of CDP-therapeutic agent conjugates (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates) in a particle, e.g., nanoparticle, in the sample, to thereby evaluate a preparation of particles, e.g., nanoparticles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically the value for a particle will be a function of the values obtained for a plurality of particles, e.g., the value will be the average of values determined for a plurality of particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments the method further comprises comparing the determined value with a reference value. The comparison can be used in a number of ways. By way of example, in response to a comparison or determination made in the method, a decision or step is taken, e.g., a production parameter in a process for making a particle is altered, the sample is classified, selected, accepted or discarded, released or withheld, processed into a drug product, shipped, moved to a different location, formulated, e.g., formulated with another substance, e.g., an excipient, labeled, packaged, released into commerce, or sold or offered for sale. E.g., based on the result of the determination, or upon comparison to a reference standard, the batch from which the sample is taken can be processed, e.g., as just described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, conjugate number is defined as the number of CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate molecules (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates) that self-assemble into a particle or nanoparticle, thus\n\n\n \n \nC\nJ\n=[CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate]/P (or NP)\n\n\nwhere Cj is conjugate number, [CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate)]/is the number of CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate molecules (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates) and P (or NP) is a single particle (or nanoparticle).\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to arrive and conjugate number one determines the size of a particle, e.g., by dynamic light scattering. The size should be viscosity-adjusted size. The hydrodynamic volume of a CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate), or a molecule of similar molecular weight, is determined, to provide an expected hydrodynamic volume. Comparison of the expected hydrodynamic volume for the CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate) with the volume for a particle of determined size provides conjugate number.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determination of conjugate number is demonstrated with CRLX101, in which camptothecin is coupled to the CDP backbone. In the case of CRLX101, a number of fundamental assumptions are made in postulating nanoparticle characteristics. First, macromolecular volume estimates are based on work done with bovine serum albumin (BSA), a biological macromolecule of similar size to CRLX101 (BSA MS=67 kDa, 101 MW=66.5 kDa). It has been demonstrated that a single strand of BSA has a hydrodynamic diameter of 9.5 nm Simple volume calculations yield a volume of 3589 nm\n3\n. Extending this to CRLX 101 with an average 30 nm particle, gives a volume of 33,485 nm\n3\n. With a particle size of 5-40 nm the conjugate number is 1-30. \nFIG. 1\n shows a calculated strand dependence on particle size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven the particle size distribution of CRLX101, the conjugate number can range from 30-75. \nFIG. 9\n shows the CRLX101 particle size dependence on conjugate number.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymer Polydispersity. CRLX101 molecules fall within a range of molecular weights, with molecules of varying weight providing varying contributions to the particle diameter and conjugate number. Particles could form which are made up of strands which are larger and smaller than the average. Strands may also associate to a maximum size which could be shear-limited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticle Shape. Particle shape is assumed to be roughly spherical, and driven by either (or both) the hydrophobic region created by the CDP-therapeutic agent conjugate (e.g., CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate), or by guest-host complexation with pendant therapeutic agent molecules making inclusion complexes with CDs from adjacent strands. One critical point of note is that as a drug product, the NPs are in a somewhat controlled environment as they are characterized. Upon administration, myriad possibilities exist for interaction with endogenous substances: inclusion complexes of circulating small molecules, metal ion complexation with the PEG subunits, etc. Any one of these are all of them in concert could dramatically alter the NP structure and function.\n\n\n \nCDPs, Methods of Making Same, and Methods of Conjugating CDPs to Topoisomerase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein can be prepared in one of two ways: monomers bearing topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties can be polymerized, or polymer backbones can be derivatized with topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties. Exemplary methods of making CDPs and CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,270,808, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDPs described herein can be made using a variety of methods including those described herein. In some embodiments, a CDP can be made by: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors; providing comonomer precursors which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomer precursors); and copolymerizing the said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP wherein CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers alternate in the water soluble linear polymer. In some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin monomers comprise linkers to which the topoisomerase inhibitor may be further linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent can be achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is suitable for the attachment of sufficient topoisomerase inhibitor such that up to at least 3%, 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP, when conjugated, is topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu. In some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the CDP by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP of the following formula can be made by the scheme below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R is of the form:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \ncomprising the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nreacting a compound of the formula below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith a compound of the formula below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least four,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin the presence of a non-nucleophilic organic base in a solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the solvent is a polar aprotic solvent. In some embodiments, the solvent is DMSO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the method also includes the steps of dialysis; and lyophylization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP provided below can be made by the following scheme:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R is of the form:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith a compound provided below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa;\n\n\nin the presence of a non-nucleophilic organic base in DMSO;\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nand dialyzing and lyophilizing the following polymer\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further contemplates CDPs and CDP-conjugates synthesized using CD-biscysteine monomer and a di-NHS ester such as PEG-DiSPA or PEG-BTC as shown in Scheme I.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nScheme XIII, as provided above, includes embodiments where gly-CPT is absent in one or more positions as provided above. This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the CPT to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of CPT is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin, by weight of the polymer, can vary. Therefore, while Scheme XIII depicts CPT at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached to the gly at each of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be made by providing a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomers), wherein the cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers alternate in the CDP and wherein the CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers; and attaching a topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via a linker. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer through an attachment that is cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer at a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via an optional linker to a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties comprise linkers to which therapeutic agents are linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is made by a process comprising: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors, providing comonomer precursors, and copolymerizing said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers. In some embodiments, the CDP is conjugated with a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin to provide a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the CDP via a linker. In some embodiments, the linker is cleaved under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor makes up at least 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer comprises polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 3,400 Da, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises beta-cyclodextrin, the theoretical maximum loading of camptothecin on a CDP-camptothecin conjugate is 13%, and camptothecin is 6-10% by weight of the CDP-camptothecin conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is poorly soluble in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of at least 6 hours. In some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of 6 hours to a month. In some embodiments, upon administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject the rate of topoisomerase inhibitor release is dependent primarily upon the rate of hydrolysis as opposed to enzymatic cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the polymer by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-polymer conjugate of the following formula can be made as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nproviding a polymer below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand coupling the polymer with a plurality of L-D moieties, wherein L is a linker, or absent and D is topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, to provide:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least 4, wherein on the final product, L can be a linker, a bond, or OH, and D can be a topoisomerase inhibitor (e.g., camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative) or absent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction scheme as provided above includes embodiments where L-D is absent in one or more positions as provided above. This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the topoisomerase inhibitor-linker to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of topoisomerase inhibitor-linker is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor, by weight of the polymer, can vary, for example, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor can be at least about 3% by weight, e.g., at least about 5%, at least about 8%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, or at least about 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, at least a portion of the L moieties of L-D is absent. In some embodiments, each L is independently an amino acid or derivative thereof (e.g., glycine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the coupling of the polymer with the plurality of L-D moieties results in the formation of a plurality of amide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the CDPs are random copolymers, in which the different subunits and/or other monomeric units are distributed randomly throughout the polymer chain. Thus, where the formula X\nm\n—Y\nn\n—Z\no \nappears, wherein X, Y and Z are polymer subunits, these subunits may be randomly interspersed throughout the polymer backbone. In part, the term “random” is intended to refer to the situation in which the particular distribution or incorporation of monomeric units in a polymer that has more than one type of monomeric units is not directed or controlled directly by the synthetic protocol, but instead results from features inherent to the polymer system, such as the reactivity, amounts of subunits and other characteristics of the synthetic reaction or other methods of manufacture, processing, or treatment.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate or particle and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound described herein, e.g., a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, butyrate, citrate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, formate, fumarate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate and undecanoate. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(alkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds described herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gailate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition may include a liquid used for suspending a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which may be any liquid solution compatible with the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which is also suitable to be used in pharmaceutical compositions, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic liquid. Suitable suspending liquids including but are not limited to suspending liquids selected from the group consisting of water, aqueous sucrose syrups, corn syrups, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition described herein may also include another component, such as an antioxidant, antibacterial, buffer, bulking agent, chelating agent, an inert gas, a tonicity agent and/or a viscosity agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and is reconstituted prior to administration to a subject. The lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be reconstituted by a diluent solution, such as a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, or a commercially available diluent, such as PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a lyophilized formulation includes a lyoprotectant or stabilizer to maintain physical and chemical stability by protecting the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition from damage from crystal formation and the fusion process during freeze-drying. The lyoprotectant or stabilizer can be one or more of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a PEG lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-ceramide or D-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), polyoxyethylene esters, poloxomers, Tweens, lecithins, saccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and polyols (e.g., trehalose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, sucrose, glucose and dextran), salts and crown ethers. In one embodiment, the lyoprotectant is mannitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted with a mixture of equal parts by volume of Dehydrated Alcohol, USP and a nonionic surfactant, such as a polyoxyethylated castor oil surfactant available from GAF Corporation, Mount Olive, N.J., under the trademark, Cremophor EL. In some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted in water for infusion. The lyophilized product and vehicle for reconstitution can be packaged separately in appropriately light-protected vials, e.g., amber or other colored vials. To minimize the amount of surfactant in the reconstituted solution, only a sufficient amount of the vehicle may be provided to form a solution having a concentration of about 2 mg/mL to about 4 mg/mL of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Once dissolution of the drug is achieved, the resulting solution is further diluted prior to injection with a suitable parenteral diluent. Such diluents are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These diluents are generally available in clinical facilities. It is, however, within the scope of the present invention to package the subject CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition with a third vial containing sufficient parenteral diluent to prepare the final concentration for administration. A typical diluent is Lactated Ringer's Injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final dilution of the reconstituted CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be carried out with other preparations having similar utility, for example, 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringer's and Dextrose for Injection (D5W), Sterile Water for Injection, and the like. However, because of its narrow pH range, pH 6.0 to 7.5, Lactated Ringer's Injection is most typical. Per 100 mL, Lactated Ringer's Injection contains Sodium Chloride USP 0.6 g, Sodium Lactate 0.31 g, Potassium chloride USP 0.03 g and Calcium Chloride 2H2O USP 0.02 g. The osmolarity is 275 mOsmol/L, which is very close to isotonicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The dosage form can be, e.g., in a bog, e.g., a bag for infusion or intraperitoneal administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.\n\n\n \nRoutes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., via intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional or intracranial injection), topically, mucosally (e.g., rectally or vaginally), nasally, buccally, ophthalmically, via inhalation spray (e.g., delivered via nebulization, propellant or a dry powder device) or via an implanted reservoir. Typically, the compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions. The preferred mode of administration is, e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate(s), particle(s) or composition(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the agent from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, gums, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouthwashes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an agent as an active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or peptidomimetic moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration are useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the a particle described herein include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active particle suspended or dissolved in a carrier with suitable emulsifying agents. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. Suppositories may be prepared by mixing one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein with one or more suitable non-irritating excipients which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature. The composition will therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate. Compositions of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOphthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and Dosing Regimens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered to a subject at a dosage of, e.g., about 1 to 40 mg/m\n2\n, about 3 to 35 mg/m\n2\n, about 9 to 40 mg/m\n2\n, e.g., about 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 mg/m\n2 \nof the topoisomerase inhibitor.

It is preferred that a composition including the conjugate, particle or composition, e.g., a composition comprising a particle or particles that include a conjugate described herein be substantially pure and/or sterile. When a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. In one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and, optionally, a diluent solution is provided for reconstituting the lyophilized agent. The diluent can include for example, a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, D5W, or PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, IV admixture bag, IV infusion set, piggyback set or syringe, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet.

Administered “in combination”, as used herein, means that two (or more) different treatments are delivered to the subject during the course of the subject's affliction with the disorder, e.g., the two or more treatments are delivered after the subject has been diagnosed with the disorder and before the disorder has been cured or eliminated or treatment has ceased for other reasons. In some embodiments, the delivery of one treatment is still occurring when the delivery of the second begins, so that there is overlap in terms of administration. This is sometimes referred to herein as “simultaneous” or “concurrent delivery”. In other embodiments, the delivery of one treatment ends before the delivery of the other treatment begins. In some embodiments of either case, the treatment is more effective because of combined administration. For example, the second treatment is more effective, e.g., an equivalent effect is seen with less of the second treatment, or the second treatment reduces symptoms to a greater extent, than would be seen if the second treatment were administered in the absence of the first treatment, or the analogous situation is seen with the first treatment. In some embodiments, delivery is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one treatment delivered in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive. The delivery can be such that an effect of the first treatment delivered is still detectable when the second is delivered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the at least one additional therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously, in the same or in separate compositions, or sequentially. For sequential administration, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered first, and the additional agent can be administered second, or the order of administration can be reversed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with other therapeutic treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, cryosurgery, and/or thermotherapy. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered agent and/or other chemotherapeutic agent, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. The phrase “radiation” includes, but is not limited to, external-beam therapy which involves three dimensional, conformal radiation therapy where the field of radiation is designed to conform to the volume of tissue treated; interstitial-radiation therapy where seeds of radioactive compounds are implanted using ultrasound guidance; and a combination of external-beam therapy and interstitial-radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as a chemotherapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., with one or more chemotherapeutic agents described herein.

For example, in one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered at a dosing schedule described herein, e.g., once every one, two, three or four weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in general, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and an additional chemotherapeutic agent(s) do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered intravenously while the chemotherapeutic agent(s) may be administered orally. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every three weeks and an additional therapeutic agent (or additional therapeutic agents) may also be administered every three weeks for as long as treatment is required. Examples of other chemotherapeutic agents which are administered one every three weeks include: an antimetabolite (e.g., floxuridine (FUDF®), pemetrexed (ALIMTA®), 5FU (Adrucil®, Efudex®, Fluoroplex®)); an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin (Cerubidine®, Rubidomycin®), epirubicin (Ellence®), idarubicin (Idamycin®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), valrubicin (Valstar®)); a vinca alkaloid (e.g., vinblastine (Velban®, Velsar®), vincristine (Vincasar®, Oncovin®), vindesine (Eldisine®) and vinorelbine (Navelbine®)); a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, larotaxel and cabazitaxel); and a platinum-based agent (e.g., cisplatin (Platinol®), carboplatin (Paraplat®, Paraplatin®), oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent that is administered orally. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more of the following chemotherapeutic agents: capecitabine (Xeloda®), estramustine (Emcyt®), erlotinib (Tarceva®), rapamycin (Rapamune®), SDZ-RAD, CP-547632; AZD2171, sunitinib (Sutent®), sorafenib (Nexavar®) and everolimus (Afinitor®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual dosage of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and/or any additional chemotherapeutic agent employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, when a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, the additional chemotherapeutic agent (or agents) is administered at a standard dose. For example, a standard dosage for cisplatin is 75-120 mg/m\n2 \nadministered every three weeks; a standard dosage for carboplatin is within the range of 200-600 mg/m\n2 \nor an AUC of 0.5-8 mg/ml×min; e.g., at an AUC of 4-6 mg/ml×min; a standard dosage for irinotecan is within 100-125 mg/m\n2\n, once a week; a standard dosage for gemcitabine is within the range of 80-1500 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly; a standard dose for UFT is within a range of 300-400 mg/m\n2 \nper day when combined with leucovorin administration; a standard dosage for leucovorin is 10-600 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosure also encompasses a method for the synergistic treatment of cancer wherein a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with an additional chemotherapeutic agent or agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of conjugate, particle or composition and anti-proliferative cytotoxic agent(s) or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the subject and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the initial order of administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation, may be varied. Thus, for example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation; or the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, anti-neoplastic agent(s), or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual subject's needs, as the treatment proceeds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the subject as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosed CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are useful in treating proliferative disorders, e.g., treating a tumor, e.g., a primary tumor, and/or metastases thereof, wherein the tumor is a primary tumor or a metastases thereof, e.g., a cancer described herein or a metastases of a cancer described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein can be used to treat a solid tumor, a soft tissue tumor or a liquid tumor.

In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n \nHuman Phase\n 1 Study of CRLX101\n\n\n \n \n \nThe below example describes the first \nhuman phase\n 1 study of CRLX101. The study was composed of two parts. \nPart\n 1 of the \nPhase\n 1 study had a primary objective to determine the safety profile, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 when administered weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of every 4-week cycle (the initial dosing regimen, sometimes referred to herein as “weekly ×3”). In \npart\n 2, after the first twelve patients were enrolled, an every other week schedule was initiated for the remainder of the \nPhase\n 1 program (sometimes referred to herein as “biweekly”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEligibility Criteria. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, or for which no standard curative or palliative therapy existed, were eligible for this trial. Prior treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors was allowed. Main eligibility criteria included male or female patients, at least 18 years of age, with advanced, histologically confirmed solid tumor refractory to standard treatment, or for which no standard therapy existed, measurable or evaluable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status≦2, acceptable organ and bone marrow function, no evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities or ischemia, and ejection fraction≧45%. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or investigational therapy had to be completed within a prescribed interval before enrollment, could not have included high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue bone marrow transplantation, and patients could not have been refractory to prior treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis trial was conducted at City of Hope (COH) (Duarte, Calif.) following approval of the Clinical Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (CPRMC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). After the initial 18 patients were enrolled, an additional site was added at TGen (Scottsdale, Ariz.) following the approval of WIRB (Western Institutional Review Board).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudy design and drug administration. This was an open-labeled, single-arm dose-\nescalation phase\n 1 study of CRLX101. In \npart\n 1, CRLX101 was administered at 6, 12, or 18 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly schedule three weeks per month. In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered at 12, 15 or 18 mg/m\n2 \non an every other week schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \npart\n 1, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 1, 8, and 15 followed by a 7 day rest period (28 day cycle). In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on \n \ndays\n \n 1 and 15, every 28 days. CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on \n \ndays\n \n 1 and 15, every 28 days for the last six patients in \npart\n 2 of the \nPhase\n 1 study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting dose in \npart\n 1 was 6 mg/m\n2\n. Dose escalation was done using an accelerated Simon design (Simon et al., “Accelerated Titration Designs for Phase I Clinical Trials in Oncology” \nJ Natl Cancer Inst. \n89:1138-47, 1997) with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme. In brief, patients were accrued in cohorts of one at escalating doses until the occurrence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle. Once a DLT occurred, additional patients were accrued in that dosage group to provide for either 3 or 6 patients as provided in a standard dose escalation with the intent of determining the maximum tolerated dose. Concurrent accrual was allowed within the same dose level. No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity Assessment. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) version 3.0. The DLT in a given patient was defined as any treatment-related grade III non-hematologic toxicity, any grade IV hematologic toxicity, or persisting toxicities of any grade requiring delay of scheduled treatment by more than 2 weeks. DLT was based on the first course of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRules for dose escalation. One patient was treated at each dose level. If a DLT attributable to the study drug(s) was experienced, up to 5 additional patients were subsequently treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs were observed at the expanded dose level (i.e., at most 1/6 with an attributable DLT), the dose was escalated. Escalation was terminated when two of six patients experienced any DLT attributable to the study drug at a given dose level. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose level preceding the dose at which ≧2/6 patients experienced a first-course DLT. Treatment was continued in an individual patient for a total of 6 cycles at the same dose level if no DLT was observed and if clinical benefit was observed. Therapy was discontinued in any patient if excessive toxicity was experienced. No intra-patient dose escalation was permitted. Patients who completed 6 cycles with clinical benefit had the option of continuing treatment at the same dose level every other week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and efficacy evaluations. Patients were seen, examined and a complete blood count with differential and serum chemistry was obtained before each dose. Radiographic assessments of tumor response (as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor criteria RECIST) were performed every two cycles (Therasse et al., “New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute of the United States, National Cancer Institute of Canada” \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n92:205-16, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment modification. Patients who experienced a DLT during the initial cycle, or a severe or life threatening non-hematologic toxicity at any time during the study, were dose reduced at the next dose administration when their DLT returned to \nGrade\n 1. If a non-hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, and the toxicity was not life threatening and resolved rapidly, the next dose administration within the cycle was to be at the next lower dose level. If a hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, the next dose administration was to be at the next lower dose level, even if the blood cell counts recovered by the date of the next scheduled administration. Dosing was to be held for any non-hematologic toxicity grade≧2, except for \ngrade\n 2 fatigue and anorexia. After the first cycle, dose modifications were based on interval toxicity, and platelet and granulocyte counts were obtained on the day of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHematologic toxicity: On \nday\n 1 of a cycle, administration of CRLX101 required an absolute granulocyte count (AGC) of ≧1500 and platelet count of ≧100,000. On \nday\n 8, if the AGC was ≧1000 and platelet count≧75,000, then CRLX101 was given at full dose and in the same manner for \nday\n 15. If the AGC was <1000, the treating physicians could delay the dose of CRLX101 on \n \ndays\n \n 8 and 15. If unacceptable hematologic toxicity persisted >7 days, the CRLX101 dose was reduced to the next lower dose level. Similar standards were used in the biweekly part.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-hematologic toxicity: Any \ngrade\n 2 toxicity that was intolerable to the patients, or any \ngrade\n 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity that was attributed to CRLX101, had to return to \ngrade\n 1 before a new cycle of treatment was started. Any treatment delay >2 weeks because of toxicity due to CRLX101 would result in the patient being removed from the study. If a patient experienced any \ngrade\n 3 genitourinary (GU) toxicity, the dose of CRLX101 was reduced to the next lower dose level, as CPT has been reported to cause hematuria, cystitis or other GU toxicities, which can be irreversible. If the patient experienced \ngrade\n 3 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to \ngrade\n 1 before the next treatment, treatment was held until recovery and then reduced by one dose level. If the patient experienced \ngrade\n 4 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to \ngrade\n 1 before the next treatment, then the dose was reduced by 50% in subsequent cycles. If there were conflicting dose attenuations by hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity, the greater dose reduction was applied. All dose modifications were permanent. Criteria for removal from treatment included disease progression, clinical progression, excessive toxicity, or patient withdrawal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma/urine sampling and analysis. Whole blood samples (5 mL) were collected in heparinized tubes at the following times during cycle one: pre-dose, during dosing at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and just prior to end of administration (90 minutes), and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, (48-72 hr optional), 168 hours (1 week), and 336 hours (only for patients on biweekly schedule) following the first dose. A spot trough PK blood sample was collected prior to dosing on \nDay\n 1 and \nDay\n 15 of every cycle. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1,300×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. Plasma was immediately frozen at −20° C., and stored frozen until analysis. For determination of urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unbound CPT, total urine collections were performed following \ndose\n 1 of the first cycle (0-24 and 24-48 hours post administration. A spot urine sample (15 mL) was collected at 8, 24, 48, 168 (1 wk), and 336 hours (pre-second dose) for more accurate determination of total to free CPT ratio. Once each urine collection was complete, the actual collection times and total volume of urine was recorded and a 5-10 mL aliquot of each was frozen for subsequent drug level analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) using a validated method. In order to determine total CPT in samples, a 20 μL aliquot was incubated with 5 μL 0.2N NaOH for 1 hour to release all CPT from the polymer conjugate. The solution was acidified with 7 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<−20° C.) methanol containing the internal standard 9-nitro camptothecin (9-NC) at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine unconjugated CPT in samples, a 20 μL aliquot was acidified with 3 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<−20° C.) methanol containing 9-NC at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5 and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLC-MS/MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Palo Alto, Calif.) coupled to a Micromass Quattro Ultima Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Beverly, Mass.). HPLC separation was achieved using a Synergy Hydro-\nRP\n 4 \nμm\n 75×2 mm analytical column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.) preceded by a C\n18 \nguard column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.). The isocratic mobile phase consisted of 34% acetonitrile, 66% 0.5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3.5 at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min at room temperature. MassLynx version 3.5 software was used for data acquisition and processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical analysis of topoisomerase I expression. Ascites fluid from one patient with ovarian cancer was obtained pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post treatment with CRLX101 at 6 mg/m\n2\n. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet frozen. The pellet was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5 μm thick sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene followed by 100% ethanol. Samples were then quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide and pretreated to promote antigen retrieval by steam in DIVA/citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Biocare Medical, Concord, Calif.) solution. After antigen retrieval, slides were incubated in Protein Block for 20 minutes. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4° C. Topoisomerase I antibody was rabbit polyclonal from Abcam (Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next day, slides were washed in Dako Buffer (DB) and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washes in DB, slides were incubated with the chromogen diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopoisomerase I enzymatic activity assay. Lysates containing total cellular protein were made from the plain frozen ascites cells according to the method of Minagawa et al. (“Enhanced Topoisomerase I Activity and Increased Topoisomerase II Alpha Content in Cisplatin-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines” \nJpn J Cancer Res. \n88:1218-23, 1997), a procedure used specifically for frozen cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe catalytic activity of topoisomerase I was determined by measuring the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA using the Topo I assay kit (TopoGEN, Port Orange, Fla.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, reaction mixtures consisted of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA (0.5 μg), whole cell lysate (0.25 μg or 0.5 μg, as indicated in data) and the assay buffer (final concentrations: 10 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.9], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine, and 5% glycerol). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes, and terminated by adding 5 μL stop buffer/gel loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in 1×TAE buffer (40 mM Tris base [pH 8.3, adjusted in the 50× stock buffer using glacial acetic acid], 2.5 mM NaOAc, and 0.05 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed at 4-5 volts per centimeter for 3-4 hours. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and relaxed DNA (0.5 μg) provided by the Topo I assay kit were used as the control markers. The gel was stained with 0.2 μg/mL ethidium bromide for 20 minutes at room temperature, destained in water for 20 minutes and photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed using the ADAPT II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, Los Angeles) non-compartmental model. Results are summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatient Enrollment. Twenty-four patients were enrolled from June 2006 to April 2010. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The patients had a variety of solid tumors, and lung cancer was the most common tumor type.

The results of a CT scan performed on this patient are shown in \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n. Four patients experienced prolonged (>6 months) SD (stable disease), one patient with renal cancer with lung metastases, two patients with non-small cell lung cancer patient, and one patient with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. (Table 3). All patients had been heavily pretreated for metastatic disease (see Table 3). Although the protocol allowed for prior treatment with CPT, none of these patients had received prior CPT treatment.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of population and patient disposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBest\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResponses\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n \n\n\nPts. w.

All patients in the first twelve enrolled (weekly ×3) experienced \n \ngrade\n \n 3 or 4 toxicities at doses above 6 mg/m\n2\n. The weekly ×3 schedule was stopped after these first twelve patients due to the severe toxicity observed in all patients treated at doses higher than 6 mg/m\n2\n. One patient tolerated 9 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly ×3 schedule for five cycles (three doses per cycle).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo patients in the second twelve patients enrolled at the bi-weekly schedule experienced severe toxicity until the MTD was reached. \nGrade\n 2 DLTs included the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne bladder cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia in \ncycle\n 2, \nday\n 8. This \ngrade\n 2 hematologic toxicity resolved in two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne lung cancer patient experienced elevated amylase in laboratory tests but no clinical manifestation of pancreatitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne head and neck cancer patient (nasopharyngeal with heavy previous chemotherapy) experienced \ndelayed onset grade\n 2 transaminitis in \ncycle\n 2, \nday\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne lung cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 hematologic toxicity which resolved in two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the highest dose tested, two patients experienced DLT hematological toxicities. The first patient, a breast cancer patient, who had metastatic disease to lung and other organs and had previously received multiple chemotherapy regimens, developed \ngrade\n 3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This patient required platelet transfusions. The second patient had metastatic lung cancer, and had previously received carboplatin and paclitaxel with a brief response. This patient developed \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia, requiring dose reduction and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. This hematological toxicity in 2 of 3 patients established 18 mg/m\n2 \nas the DLT level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne pancreatic cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia on cycle 5, \nday\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with hepatocellular cancer passed away one week after \ncycle\n 3, \nday\n 1 due to progressive disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with lung cancer who had received multiple prior regimens, developed \ngrade\n 2 neutropenia on \ncycle\n 3, \nday\n 15. This patient required a dose reduction and G-CSF support.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the long terminal half-life of polymer conjugated, and especially unconjugated, CPT (see \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n), the protocol was amended in \npart\n 2 to evaluate an every other week schedule. A total of 12 patients were treated on this schedule, three at 12 mg/m\n2 \nand six at 15 mg/m\n2 \nand three at 18 mg/m\n2\n. Except for one occurrence of \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia, no \ngrade\n 3/4 hematologic events were recorded at dose level 12 mg/m\n2 \nand 15 mg/m\n2\n. At dose level 18 mg/m\n2 \none \ngrade\n 4 leukopenia, two \ngrade\n 4 neutropenia, two \ngrade\n 4 thrombocytopenia and one \ngrade\n 3 anemia were reported under hematological toxicities. This determined the DLT of bone marrow suppression at 18 mg/m\n2 \non this schedule. The only other notable non hematologic event was a \ngrade\n 3 hypersensitivity reaction. (Table 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows a summary of all \ngrade\n 3/4 treatment related toxicities for all evaluable patients. Four patients on the weekly schedule developed delayed onset (after cycle 4) mild hematuria and mild dysuria that may have been related to treatment as previously reported for CPT (Muggia et al., “Phase I Clinical Trial of Weekly and Daily Treatment with Camptothecin (NSC-100880): Correlation with Preclinical Studies” \nCancer Chemother Rep \n56:515-521, 1972). However, upon evaluation by a urologist, cystitis could not be confirmed. Thus, at 18 mg/m\n2 \nbiweekly two patients were reported who developed DLT, and the MTD for the biweekly schedule was established as 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment related grade ¾ hematologic and non-hematologic adverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevents by dose cohort observed during all courses of therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOSE\n\n\n \nGrade\n 3\n\n\n \nGrade\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 6 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nElevated \nCPK\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nFatigue\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nlymphopenia\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhyponatremia\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDysuria/\ncystitis\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthrombocytopenia\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nleukopenia\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nneutropenia\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nanemia\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nfatigue\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ndehydration\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrash\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSOB\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nHypersensitivity\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic analysis. Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected from all patients during \ncycle\n 1. Results from this analysis are summarized in \nFIGS. 2A\n, \n2\nB and Table 5. The mean elimination half-lives were 31.8±5.7 hr and 43.8±9.7 hr for conjugated and unconjugated CPT, respectively. Volume of distribution of the polymer conjugate was 4.2±1.1 liter and was independent of dose. The low volume of distribution suggests that CRLX101 is initially retained in plasma and avoids rapid first pass clearance. C. and AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n summarize pharmacokinetic parameters measured for polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT for both schedules. Unconjugated CPT was slowly released from CRLX101 as shown by increasing plasma concentrations that peaked at 20.2±9.7 hrs. Plasma concentrations of unconjugated CPT were significantly below the plasma concentrations of conjugated CPT at all timepoints, with unconjugated CPT accounting for an average of 8.7±2.7% of total CPT plasma exposure. \nFIG. 2A\n shows average plasma time-concentration curves for the biweekly 12 mg/m cohort Systemic plasma clearance of conjugated CPT was 0.12±0.2 L/h, significantly below the kidney and liver blood flows in humans, and was also independent of dose. \nFIG. 2B\n shows average urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT in the first 48 hours following CRLX101 administration. Urinary loss of total CPT was variable with an average of 22.8±12.1% of dose excreted during the first 48 hours, of which 78±9% was in the conjugated form. Interestingly, urinary excretion of the polymer conjugate was primarily in the first 24 hours (16.4%±10.0% of dose) compared to the second 24 hours (1.5±1.3% of dose) post administration. Urinary excretion of unconjugated CPT remained approximately constant over both 24 hour periods (2.0±1.1% vs. 2.9±1.4% of dose). Toxicokinetic analysis of the two schedules showed that the predicted monthly exposure for conjugated and unconjugated CPT was similar for 6 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 12 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly and 12 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 15 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly; however, fewer patients experienced cycle one drug related adverse events with the bi-weekly regimen.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters and toxicokinetic summary.

Ascites cells were collected from one patient with ovarian cancer pre-treatment and on \n \nDays\n \n 2 and 25 post-treatment. Pellets of these cells were frozen for later analysis. Levels of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT were also determined in the ascites fluid pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post-treatment. On \nday\n 2, the concentrations detected were 46.6 μg/L for conjugated CPT and 19.6 μg/L for fully active, unconjugated CPT. For each amount of lysate used, there was less topoisomerase I unwinding activity (i.e., more remaining supercoiled DNA) in the \nDay\n 2 samples than in the pretreatment or \nDay\n 25 samples. This suggests an inhibitory effect of CRLX101 on these cells at this early time point after administration. The ascites cells were also used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the levels of topoisomerase I. Basic agreement was observed between the topoisomerase I activity assay and topoisomerase I IHC. As seen in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n, there was a reduction of approximately 30% in staining in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells isolated from the patient's \nascites fluid\n 2 days after treatment (\nFIG. 3B\n), compared to a similar sample taken before drug administration (\nFIG. 3A\n). The decrease in topoisomerase I levels directly seen by IHC in these cells at 48 hours explains why much of the supercoiled DNA remains present in lanes of \nFIG. 3C\n with reactions from \nDay\n 2 lysates; i.e., there is much less enzyme available to act on these substrate molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSummary. In the phase I trial reported above, two dosing schedules, weekly ×3 and every other week (biweekly), were investigated. In the weekly ×3 schedule the maximum tolerated dose was approximately 9 mg/m\n2\n. Hematologic toxicity and cystitis were the DLTs in this schedule. \nNon-hematologic grade\n 3/4 adverse events included fatigue in 3 patients (25%), delayed onset hematuria/dysuria in 2 patients (17%), elevated CPK (creatine phosphokinase) in 1 patient (8%), and dehydration in 1 patient (8%), all of which were reversible. Cumulative bladder toxicity in some patients on this schedule was primarily observed post cycle one and may have been related to the long terminal half-life of unconjugated CPT, which is primarily cleared through the kidneys, leading to cumulative bladder irritation. Based on this observation, it was decided to investigate a biweekly schedule as a strategy to reduce cumulative toxicity while maintaining dose delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events. The only observed \ngrade\n 3/4 adverse event was \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia in one patient that was reversible. One dose reduction was required on this schedule. On this schedule, CRLX101 was well tolerated without the toxicities normally associated with camptothecin analogs, such as severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic cystitis. The MTD on this schedule was determined to be 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of CRLX101 was performed after the first dose for all patients. Consistent with preclinical data, the pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 were characterized by a low volume of distribution and limited systemic clearance. Preclinical studies showed accumulation of CRLX101 in tumors and tissues of the reticuloendothelial system such as liver and spleen. Increased release of active CPT from the conjugate was also observed in these tissues. This study also confirmed that release kinetics of CPT were such that plasma levels of unconjugated CPT remained significantly below levels of conjugate at all times. After one week, approximately 10% of the maximum recorded concentration of unconjugated CPT was still detected in plasma, possibly leading to the cumulative toxicity observed on the weekly ×3 schedule. On the biweekly schedule however, unconjugated CPT levels dropped below the limit of quantitation before the second dose, which may explain the lack of urinary side effects on this schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, CRLX101 was well tolerated and myelosuppression was the DLT. Ten out of twenty-four patients demonstrated stable disease on CT scan evaluation at the end of \ncycle\n 2. One pancreatic cancer patient remained stable for 22.8 months. Serum and urine PK data from all the treated patients indicated that the mean elimination half-lives for conjugated and unconjugated CPT were 31.8 hr and 43.8 hr, respectively. C\nmax \nand AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. The biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients, but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nSynthesis of 6\nA\n,6\nD\n-Bis-(2-amino-2-carboxylethylthio)-6\nA\n,6\nD\n-dideoxy-β-cyclodextrin, 4 (CD-BisCys)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n167 mL of 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer were degassed for 45 minutes in a 500 mL 2-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a condenser and septum. To this solution were added 1.96 g (16.2 mmol) of L-cysteine and 10.0 g (73.8 mmol) of diiodo, deoxy-β-\ncyclodextrin\n 2. The resulting suspension was heated at a reflux temperature for 4.5 h until the solution turned clear (colorless). The solution was then cooled to room temperature and acidified to \npH\n 3 using 1N HCl. The product was precipitated by slow addition of acetone (3 times weight ratio of the solution). This afforded 9.0 g crude material containing CD-biscysteine (90.0%), unreacted cyclodextrin, CD-mono-cysteine and cystine. The resulting solid was subjected to anionic exchange column chromatography (SuperQ650M, Tosoh Bioscience) using a gradient elution of 0-0.4M ammonium bicarbonate. All fractions were analyzed by HPLC. The desired fractions were combined and the solvent was reduced to 100 mL under vacuum. The final product was either precipitated by adding acetone or by adding methanol (3 times weight ratio of the solution). 4 was obtained in 60-90% yield. \n1\nH NMR (D\n2\nO) δ 5.08 (m, 7H, CD-2-CH), 3.79-3.94 (m, 30H, CD-3,4-CH, CD-CH\n2\n, Cys-CH), 3.49-3.62 (m, 14H, CD-5,6-CH), 2.92-3.30 (m, 4H, Cys-CH\n2\n). \n13\nC NMR (D\n2\nO) δ 172.3, 101.9, 83.9, 81.6, 81.5, 73.3, 72.2, 72.0, 60.7, 54.0, 34.0, 30.6.

When 2.3 eq. of DIEA were added, the viscosity of the polymerization solution increased dramatically after 4-6 hours of reaction. DIEA deprotonates the amino groups of 4 to render them more nucleophilic for coupling with PEG-DiSPA. There were essentially no differences in the polymerizations if other bases, such as TEA or DMAP, were used (36b-c, Table 6). Polymerization using 4 recovered by the two different precipitation methods (acetone and methanol) produced polymers with different MWs. 4 that was purified by the methanol-precipitation method (contains no free cystine) gave higher MW polymer (36d-e) as compared to the less pure 4 that was obtained from the acetone-precipitation method (36a).

The polymer was precipitated with ethyl ether (1 L). The ether was poured out and the precipitate was washed with CH\n3\nCN (3×100 mL). The precipitate was dissolved in \nwater\n 600 mL. Some insoluble solid was filtered through 0.2 μm filters. The solution was dialyzed using 25,000 MWCO membrane (Spectra/Por 7) for 10 h at 10-15° C. in DI water. Dialysis water was changed every 60 minutes. The polymer-drug conjugate solution was sterilized by passing it through 0.2 μM filters.

An aliquot of corresponding stock solution was diluted to 100 μg/mL using 1 N NaOH. CPT was completely hydrolyzed in this basic solution and transformed to its carboxylate form within 2 h at room temperature. An aliquot of this solution was diluted to 10 μg/mL using 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and the CPT carboxylate form was transformed to its lactone form. 30 μL of this solution was injected into the HPLC. The peak area from the CPT lactone form was integrated and compared to a standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n11 and 12 were conjugated to 36e or 36f (Table 2) using conventional coupling methods. Due to the instability of the ester linker of 11 and 12 in aqueous solution, the conjugation was conducted in anhydrous DMSO under argon. An organic base was required to deprotonate the TFA salts of 11 and 12 to facilitate the coupling. For polymer conjugation with 12, the weight percent (wt %) drug loading was around 6-10%. The theoretical maximum drug loading is around 13% using PEG with MW of 3400 Da; maximum values can be increased by decreasing the MW of the PEG segments. Solubilities of all conjugates in water or PBS were more than 200 mg/mL (equivalent to a 12-20 mg CPT/mL for 6-10 wt % drug loading, respectively).

Synthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg Copolymer with a Short Peg Linkage and its GlyCPT Conjugate\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\n \n \n \nSynthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg (short PEG, e.g., Peg200-Peg2000) and its \nCPT Conjugate\n 42\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of polymer and \ndrug conjugate\n 42 are same as 36, 37, and 38\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile Scheme VI shows that the drug is attached at all available positions, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VI depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod II. Synthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg Copolymer with Multiple Drug Molecules on Each Loading Site.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nSynthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg and its GluBis(GlyCPT) Conjugate 43\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n36 and Glu-Bis(Gly-CPT) 17 are dissolved in DMSO. EDC (3 eq), NHS (2.2 eq), and DIEA (2.2 eq) are added to the solution. CD-BisCys-Peg-GluBis(GlyCPT) 43 is precipitated with CH\n3\nCN and washed with the same solvent until no free drug is detected using UV or TLC. 43 is dried under high vacuum. While Scheme VII shows that the drug is attached at all available positions, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CDP reacted at three, two, one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VII depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 4 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include four, three, two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having four, three, two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nSynthesis and In Vitro Analysis of CDP-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n \n \n \nSN-38 was derivatized with the amino acid glycine at the 20-OH position as shown in Scheme VIII. Briefly, 20(S)-7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38, 1.0 g, 2.5 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 70 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) and 30 mL pyridine. A solution of di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (0.83 g, 3.8 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature overnight (12 hours). The solvent was removed under vacuum to yield a yellow solid and re-crystallized from boiling 2-propanol (75 mL) to yield 20(s)-10-tert-butoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethyl-camptothecin (Boc-SN-38) as a yellow solid (0.6 g, 48% yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoc-SN-38 (0.73 g, 1.5 mmol), N-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)glycine (0.26 g, 1.5 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.18 g, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous methylene chloride (30 mL) and chilled to 0° C. 1,3-Diisopropyl-carbodiimide (DIPC, 0.19 g, 1.5 mmol) was added, the mixture stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes followed by stiffing for 4 hours at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with methylene chloride to 100 mL, washed twice with an aqueous solution of 0.1N hydrochloric acid (25 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed under vacuum. The resulting yellow solid was purified by flash chromatography in methylene chloride:acetone (9:1) followed by solvent removal under vacuum to yield 20-O—(N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)glycyl)-10-tert-butyoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (diBoc-Gly-SN-38, 640 mg, 67% yield).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCDP was synthesized as previously described (Cheng et al. (2003) Bioconjugate Chemistry 14(5):1007-1017). diBOC-Gly-SN-38 (0.62 g, 0.77 mmol) was deprotected in 15 mL of a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride:trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature for 1 hour. 20-O-trifluoroglycine-10-hydroxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (TFA-Gly-SN-38, 0.57 g, 97% yield) was isolated as a yellow solid by precipitation with ethanol (100 mL), followed by two washes with ethanol (30 mL each), dissolution in methylene chloride and removal of solvent under vacuum. ESI/MS expected 449.4; Found 471.66 (M+Na).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Gly-SN-38 (Poly-CD-PEG-Gly-SN-38, scheme IX) was synthesized as follows: CDP (270 mg, 0.056 mmol), TFA-Gly-SN-38 (70 mg, 0.12 mmol), N-hydroxy-succinimide (14 mg, 0.12 mmol), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDCI, 32 mg, 0.17 mmol) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (10 mL) and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The polymer was precipitated by addition of 50 mL acetone followed by 50 mL diethyl ether. Precipitate was centrifuged, washed twice with 20 mL acetone each, and dissolved in water acidified to pH 3.0 with hydrochloric acid. Polymer solution was dialized for 24 hours against pH 3.0 water using a 25 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane. The resulting solution was lyophilized to yield CDP-Gly-SN-38 (180 mg, 67% yield). The polymer was analyzed for total and free SN-38 content by HPLC using SN-38 as a standard curve as previously described (Cheng et al. (2003) Bioconjugate Chemistry 14(5):1007-1017). Total SN-38 content was 7.66% w/w of which 97.4% was polymer bound. Average particle size was determined by dynamic light scattering to be 27.9 nm.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile Scheme IX shows that the drug is attached at all available positions in the subunit, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme IX depicts SN-38 at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate can have less than 2 SN-38 molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no Sn-38 attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit.

The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the test compound at concentrations ranging from 0.01 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L. Triplicate wells per plate were treated at each concentration. Controls were vehicle-treated cells and medium only blank. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 72 h. MTS assay reagent was prepared by diluting CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) 5-fold into PBS/glucose (4.5 g/L). Cell culture medium was aspirated and 100 μL of MTS reagent were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The plates were shaken for 5 min and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm using a SPECTRAFluor Plus plate reader (Tecan). The percentage of cell survival was calculated relative to untreated cells, and IC50s were estimated from the graphs of log dose (nmol/L) versus % cell survival (GraphPad Prizm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this experiment are shown in Table 9 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of SN-38 and CDP-Gly-SN-38 on A2780 ovarian cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSN-38\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDP-PEG-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n7.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nCRLX101 Causes a Dose-Dependent Inhibition of Tumor Growth in a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Model (A549) Possessing a KRAS Mutation\n\n\n \n \n \nA549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Gemcitabine at 120 mg/kg resulted in a median TTE of 68.7 days, corresponding to 44.3-day TGD (182%), five tumor-free survivors (TFS) with a median tumor volume (MTV) of 0 mm3, two partial regressions (PRs), and one transient complete regression (CR). Docetaxel at 30 mg/kg resulted in 13.4-day TGD (55%), two D74 survivors with an MTV of 302 mm3, and one PR. Topotecan at 12 mg/kg resulted in 14.8-day TGD (61%), and one TFS. Docetaxel therapy resulted in acceptable 9.3% group mean body weight loss on D21; mean weight losses were <3% with all other drugs. Erlotinib and pemetrexed produced non-significant survival extensions. Erlotinib at 100 mg/kg resulted in 4.7-day TGD (19%), pemetrexed at 500 mg/kg resulted in 1.9-day TGD (8%), and neither drug yielded D74 survivors or regressions. Both were well-tolerated. Two deaths among pemetrexed-treated mice were classified as non-treatment-related. CRLX101 at 10 mg/kg was well tolerated and resulted in assigned median TTEs of 74 days post first treatment, corresponding to the maximum possible 49.6-day TGD (203%), and yielded 100% complete response and survivors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, CRLX101 at 10 mg/kg qwk×3 resulted in 100% tumor-free survival for 74 days (post first treatment) in the H1299 human NSCLC xenograft model. In comparison, among the marketed drugs administered on optimal preclinical regimens: gemcitabine yielded 50% TFS and three transient regressions; topotecan yielded 10% TFS; docetaxel yielded 20% survival and no TFS; and erlotinib and pemetrexed each had non-significant activities. Docetaxel caused body weight loss within the acceptable limit (<20%) and CRLX101 and all other treatment agents were well-tolerated, except that one animal dosed at 10 mg/kg experienced >15% BW loss on Days 18-25, and was documented to be thin, hunched, and have an impaired gait on D25. This animal subsequently gained weight and survived to the end of the study. Although drug toxicity could not be excluded in this animal, it was unlikely, as no substantial weight loss occurred in other CRLX101-treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Summary of different treatment regimens in a NSCLC H1299 model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResponse Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGr\n\n\nn\n\n\nRegimen\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nTTE\n\n\nT − C\n\n\n% TGD\n\n\nvalue\n\n\nPR\n\n\n \nCR\n \n \nTFS\n\n\nNadir\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n—\n\n\nqwk x 3,\n\n\n24.4\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nGemcitabine\n \n\n\n120\n\n\nq3d x 4,\n\n\n68.7\n\n\n44.3\n\n\n182\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n2\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n−2.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.p.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nDocetaxel\n \n\n\n30\n\n\nqwk x 3,\n\n\n27.8\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n55\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−9.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n10\n\n\nTopotecan\n\n\n12\n\n\nq4d x 3,\n\n\n39.2\n\n\n14.8\n\n\n61\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n−0.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.p.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nErlotinib\n \n\n\n100\n\n\nqd x 21,\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n19\n\n\n \nNS\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−2.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np.o.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nPemetrexed\n \n\n\n500\n\n\nqd x 14,\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n8\n\n\n \nNS\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np.o.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nCRLX101\n \n\n\n6\n\n\nQwk x 3,\n\n\n74.0\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n203\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n1\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nCRLX101\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nqwk x 3,\n\n\n74.0\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n203\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n0\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n−1.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = number of animals in a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTE = time to endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT − C = difference between median TTE (days) of treated versus control group,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% TGD = [(T − C)/C] × 100.

The cells were then resuspended in RPMI-1640 (no FBS/antibiotics). NCI-H1299 cells (density=50×10\n6 \ncells in 100 mL) were implanted subcutaneously (SC) into the mammary fat pad of male Taconic NCR nu/nu mice (20-22 g) on \nday\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFive treatments were administered to mice starting 28 days post tumor implantation, when the group mean tumor volume was 350-384 mm3. The animals were divided into the following treatment groups: 1) PBS solution (q7d×3); 2) 6 mg/kg CRLX101, weekly for 3 weeks (i.v.) 3) 45 mg/kg sorafenib, daily for 21 days (p.o.); 4); 60 mg/kg sorafenib, daily for 21 days (p.o.); 5) 60 mg/kg sorafenib, daily for 21 days (p.o.) plus 6 mg/kg CRLX101, weekly for 3 weeks (i.v.). Intravenous treatments were given into the tail vein of the mouse at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. Oral treatments were administered at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. Health status of the animals was monitored daily and the body weight and tumor volume were measured two times a week for 4 weeks and then once a week thereafter to evaluate the effect of the treatment. The study endpoint used to determine the tumor growth delay was a group mean tumor size of 1000 mm3. Thereafter, the individual endpoint was a mouse tumor size of 1000 mm\n3\n, after which the mouse was removed from the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments are in the claims."

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/692,870 filed Mar. 28, 2007; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/964,285 filed Dec. 26, 2007; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/017,125 filed Dec. 27, 2007; all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are irreversible kinase inhibitor compounds, methods for synthesizing such irreversible inhibitors, and methods for using such irreversible inhibitors in the treatment of diseases. Further described herein are methods, assays and systems for determining an appropriate irreversible inhibitor of a protein, including a kinase.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA kinase, alternatively known as a phosphotransferase, is a type of enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific target molecules; the process is termed phosphorylation. Protein kinases, which act on and modify the activity of specific proteins, are used to transmit signals and control complex processes in cells. Up to 518 different kinases have been identified in humans. Their enormous diversity and role in signaling makes them attractive targets for drug design.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of Btk. Further described are irreversible inhibitors of Btk that form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on Btk. Further described herein are irreversible inhibitors of other tyrosine kinases, wherein the other tyrosine kinases share homology with Btk by having a cysteine residue (including a \nCys\n 481 residue) that forms a covalent bond with the irreversible inhibitor (such tyrosine kinases, are referred herein as “Btk tyrosine kinase cysteine homologs”). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of tyrosine kinases that have an accessible cysteine residue near an active site of the tyrosine kinase (referred herein as “Accessible Cysteine Kinases” or ACKs). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of any of the aforementioned tyrosine kinases, in which the irreversible inhibitor includes a Michael acceptor moiety. Further described are such irreversible inhibitors in which the Michael acceptor moiety preferentially forms a covalent bond with the appropriate cysteine residue on the desired tyrosine kinase relative to forming a covalent bond with other biological molecules that contain an accessible SH moiety. Also described herein are methods for synthesizing such irreversible inhibitors, methods for using such irreversible inhibitors in the treatment of diseases (including diseases wherein irreversible inhibition of Btk provides therapeutic benefit to a patient having the disease). Further described are pharmaceutical formulations that include an irreversible inhibitor of Btk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein include those that have a structure of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, esters, acids and prodrugs thereof.

For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition including a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms without undue adverse side effects. An appropriate “effective amount” in any individual case is optionally determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study. The term “therapeutically effective amount” includes, for example, a prophylactically effective amount. An “effective amount” of a compound disclosed herein is an amount effective to achieve a desired pharmacologic effect or therapeutic improvement without undue adverse side effects. It is understood that “an effect amount” or “a therapeutically effective amount” can vary from subject to subject, due to variation in metabolism of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), age, weight, general condition of the subject, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “electron dense group,” as used herein, refers to a group which scatters electrons when irradiated with an electron beam.

(C) presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of tumor growth in DOHH2 xenograft models. For in vivo lymphoma xenograft studies, 5E6 DOHH2 or DLCL2 cells in 50% matrigel were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice and dosed orally with \nCompound\n 1 beginning when tumor size reached 100 mm2\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1O1aHsd mice. Compound for vehicle was dosed orally once per day starting at \nday\n 1. Dexamethasone was included as a positive control. Paw inflammation was scored from 0-5 and averaged across all paws from all animals for each group in the study. \nCompound\n 1 at 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg regressed inflammation through the end of the study (day 11) while 3.125 mg/kg significantly reduced the increase in paw inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of disease progression in a mouse MRL/lpr model of lupus. MRL/lpr mice (Jax strain 000485) were dosed orally once per day from 8 weeks of age until 20 weeks of age and urine protein levels were measured weekly. \nCompound\n 1 at 3.125 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg significantly reduced proteinuria, indicating amelioration of the progressive autoimmune renal failure seen in this mouse strain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n presents an illustrative bar graph showing inhibition of mast cell degranulation in a mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. 23 hours after mice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE in the back, they received a single oral dose of \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle. After one hour, animals were challenged with an intravenous injection of DNP-BSA and Evans Blue dye and the area of extravasation was measured. Increasing doses of \nCompound\n 1 significantly decreased the amount of Evans Blue release, indicating decreased mast cell activation and vascular permeabilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n presents an illustrative line graph showing in vivo plasma concentrations post-dosing of male jugular vein cannulated rats with \n \n \n \nCompounds\n \n \n \n 1, 7, 8, and 12. Blood samples were collected at 0.0833 (5 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours post-dosing from orally dosed rats. \nCompound\n 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, \nCompound\n 7 and \nCompound\n 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life. Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n presents an illustrative bar graph showing brief exposure to \nCompound\n 1 in vitro is sufficient to inhibit B cell activation in normal human B cells. B cells were purified from blood from healthy donors by negative selecting using the RosetteSep Human B cell enrichment cocktail. Cells were plated in growth media and indicated concentrations of \nCompound\n 1 were added. After incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed three times using an 8-fold dilution in growth media for each wash. Cells were then stimulated with IgM F(ab′)2 for 18 hours at 37° C., stained with anti-CD69-PE antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. This protocol mimics the predicted exposure of cells to \nCompound\n 1 in vivo and demonstrates that inhibition of B cells is sustained despite washing out of \nCompound\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n presents illustrative ACKs, including Btk and Btk cysteine homologs.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIrreversible Inhibitor Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following description of irreversible kinase inhibitor compounds suitable for use in the methods described herein, definitions of referred-to standard chemistry terms may be found in reference works (if not otherwise defined herein), including Carey and Sundberg “Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. In addition, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for Btk (e.g., human Btk) are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,469. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for kinases having an accessible cysteine residue (such kinases are also known as Accessible Cysteine Kinases, or ACKs) that can form a covalent bond with a Michael acceptor moiety on the inhibitor compound. In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is accessible or becomes accessible when the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to the kinase. That is, the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to an active site of the ACK and the Michael acceptor moiety of irreversible inhibitor gains access (in one embodiment the step of binding leads to a conformational change in the ACK, thus exposing the cysteine) or is otherwise exposed to the cysteine residue of the ACK; as a result a covalent bond is formed between the “S” of the cysteine residue and the Michael acceptor of the irreversible inhibitor. Consequently, the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor remains bound or otherwise blocks the active site of the ACK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the ACK is Btk, a homolog of Btk or a tyrosine kinase having a cysteine residue in an amino acid sequence position that is homologous to the amino acid sequence position of \ncysteine\n 481 in Btk. See, e.g., kinases in \nFIG. 7\n. Inhibitor compounds described herein include a Michael acceptor moiety, a binding site moiety and a linker that links the binding site moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety (and in some embodiments, the structure of the linker provides a conformation, or otherwise directs the Michael acceptor moiety, so as to improve the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor for a particular ACK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, an irreversible inhibitor compound used in the methods described herein is identified or characterized in an in vitro assay, e.g., an acellular biochemical assay or a cellular functional assay. Such assays are useful to determine an in vitro IC\n50 \nfor an irreversible inhibitor compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an acellular kinase assay can be used to determine kinase activity after incubation of the kinase in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible inhibitor compound. If the candidate compound is in fact an irreversible inhibitor, kinase activity will not be recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium. See, e.g., J. B. Smaill, et al. (1999), \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42(10):1803-1815. Further, covalent complex formation between a Kinase and a candidate irreversible inhibitor is a useful indicator of irreversible inhibition of the Kinase that can be readily determined by a number of methods (e.g., mass spectrometry). For example, some irreversible Kinase-inhibitor compounds can form a covalent bond with the aforenoted cysteine residue (e.g., via a Michael reaction).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh throughput assays for many acellular biochemical assays (e.g., kinase assays) and cellular functional assays (e.g., calcium flux) are documented methodologies. In addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, Calif.; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass., etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. Automated systems thereby allow the identification and characterization of a large number of irreversible compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIrreversible inhibitor compounds can used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the irreversible inhibitor compound used for the methods described herein inhibits a Kinase activity with an in vitro IC\n50 \nof less than 10 μM. (e.g., less than 1 μM, less than 0.5 μM, less than 0.4 μM, less than 0.3 μM, less than 0.1, less than 0.08 μM, less than 0.06 μM, less than 0.05 μM, less than 0.04 μM, less than 0.03 μM, less than less than 0.02 μM, less than 0.01, less than 0.008 μM, less than 0.006 μM, less than 0.005 μM, less than 0.004 μM, less than 0.003 μM, less than less than 0.002 μM, less than 0.001, less than 0.00099 μM, less than 0.00098 μM, less than 0.00097 μM, less than 0.00096 μM, less than 0.00095 μM, less than 0.00094 μM, less than 0.00093 μM, less than 0.00092, or less than 0.00090 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the irreversible inhibitor compound selectively and irreversibly inhibits an activated form of its target tyrosine kinase (e.g., a phosphorylated form of the tyrosine kinase). For example, activated Btk is transphosphorylated at tyrosine 551. Thus, in these embodiments the irreversible Btk inhibitor inhibits the target kinase in cells only once the target kinase is activated by the signaling events.\n\n\n \nParticular Irreversible Inhibitor Compounds for ACKs\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII).

Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In one embodiment, each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd\n0\n-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, provided herein are methods of making and methods of using tyrosine kinase inhibitor compounds described herein.

It is understood that when reference is made to compounds described herein, it is meant to include compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), as well as to all of the specific compounds that fall within the scope of these generic formulae, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein may possess one or more stereocenters and each center may exist in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers may be obtained, if desired, by methods such as, for example, the separation of stereoisomers by chiral chromatographic columns\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. In one embodiment, enantiomers can be separated by chiral chromatographic columns In other embodiments, enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) by treating with a reducing agent, such as, but not limited to, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like at 0 to 80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, prodrugs of compounds can be designed (if desired) (for examples of this procedure applied to other compounds, see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) \nMedicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach\n, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), \nBioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters\n, Vol. 4, p. 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the compounds herein-described are prodrugs for another derivative or active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug optionally has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., \nAm. J.

Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein (for example, compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII)) are optionally in the form of, and/or used as, pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The type of pharmaceutical acceptable salts, include, but are not limited to: (1) acid addition salts, formed) by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable: inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and the like; or with an organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4′-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion (e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium), an alkaline earth ion (e.g. magnesium, or calcium), or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe corresponding counterions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are optionally analyzed and identified using various methods including, but not limited to, ion exchange chromatography, ion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, inductively coupled plasma, atomic absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salts are recovered by using at least one of the following techniques: filtration, precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are optionally formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that a reference to a salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility.

Up to 518 different kinases have been identified in humans. Many kinase inhibitor compounds non-selectively bind and/or inhibit these kinases because the active sites of some of these kinases are similar in structure. Such cross-reactivity is not a desired feature of a kinase inhibitor compound because of the potential for undesired side effects when such a compound is being administered to treat a disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have observed that small differences in the structure of kinase inhibitor compounds have profound effects in the selectivity of similarly-structured kinases (e.g., ACKs, including, Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, we have developed assays, methods, and systems for converting a non-selective inhibitor compound into a highly-selective inhibitor compound. In brief, the non-selective inhibitor compound is provided with a Michael acceptor moiety and a linker moiety that links the Michael acceptor moiety to the remainder of the non-selective inhibitor compound. A series of linker and Michael acceptor moieties provides a small library/panel of test inhibitor compounds. The inhibitor library/panel is contacted with a panel of structurally related kinases (e.g., Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). Binding is determined by a variety of means, included fluorescence detection (or via any other detectable label), mass spectrometry, or a combination of approaches. An Activity Probe is optionally used to detect binding of members of the inhibitor library/panel to the kinase library/panel. The binding data is then optionally collected and analyzed to provide a structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the structure of the members of the inhibitor panel/library (e.g., Michael acceptor and/or linker moieties) and the activity of binding to and/or inhibiting members of the kinase panel. Based on this information, further modifications are suggested if necessary. We have successfully used this approach to improve the binding and selectivity of Btk inhibitor compounds (see Examples herein, including “Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform” example section).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar approach can be use for converting a selective inhibitor compound for a group of similarly-structured ACKs (including, Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs) into a more highly-selective inhibitor compound (e.g., more selective for a particular ACK over structurally-similar ACKs), or for converting a selective inhibitor compound for a particular ACK (e.g., Btk) into an even more selective inhibitor of that particular ACK. For example, in brief, the selective inhibitor compound (which, for example, contains an active-site binding moiety, a linker moiety and a Michael acceptor moiety) is modified. In one embodiment, a series of linker and Michael acceptor moieties provides a small library/panel of test inhibitor compounds. The inhibitor library/panel is contacted with a panel of structurally related kinases (e.g., Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). Binding is determined by a variety of means, included fluorescence detection (or via any other detectable label), mass spectrometry, or a combination of approaches. An Activity Probe is optionally used to detect binding of members of the inhibitor library/panel to the kinase library/panel. The binding data is then optionally collected and analyzed to provide a structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the structure of the members of the inhibitor panel/library (e.g., Michael acceptor and/or linker moieties) and the activity of binding to and/or inhibiting members of the kinase panel. Based on this information, further modifications are suggested if necessary. We have also successfully used this approach to improve the binding and selectivity of Btk inhibitor compounds (see Examples herein, including “Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform” example section).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, for our highly selective \nBTK inhibitor Compound\n 1, we engineered an electrophilic center capable of irreversibly inactivating the target enzyme, BTK. That is, to an active site binding moiety of a reversible inhibitor was added a linker moiety and a Michael acceptor moiety that achieved a high degree of potency and selectivity by (1) fitting the core scaffold into the active site ATP binding pocket of kinase enzymes, and (2) forming a covalent bond with Cysteine-481 located in BTK. The chemistry required for covalent bond formation involves an electrophilic moiety that acts as a Michael acceptor, which bonds with a nucleophile (such as Cys-481) present in a precise location within the active site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the linker and Michael acceptor moiety of \nCompound\n 1 was modified to provide \nCompound\n 9 which has a different selectivity pattern. Table 1 is a table showing the degree of inhibition of a panel of kinases for two example compounds. IC\n50\ns were determined using the in vitro HotSpot kinase assay (purified enzymes, 33P-ATP, an appropriate substrate and 1 uM ATP.) Compared to \nCompound\n 1, \nCompound\n 9 has similar potency toward Btk, but significantly less potency toward JAK-3, ITK, and EGFR and significantly more potency toward the src-family kinases lck, c-src, FGR, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn and Yes. Thus, subtle modifications in the linker moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety are important for the design of selective ACK inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCompound\n 1\n\n\n \nCompound\n 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKinase\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBTK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nITK\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n909.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBmx/ETK\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTEC\n\n\n77.8\n\n\n108.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEFGR\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER2\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n1536.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER4\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLCK\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBLK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC-src\n\n\n262.6\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFGR\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFyn\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHCK\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLyn\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYES\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nABL\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n32.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBrk\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSK\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFER\n\n\n8,070.0\n\n\n3,346.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAK3\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n8,278.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYK\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 of Example 1c in the “Kinase Discovery Platform and Pulse Dosing” section of the examples section provides further modifications of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety and the impact of such changes of inhibitor selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect described herein are methods of identifying an irreversible inhibitor of a kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (or indeed, any ACK) comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) contacting a multiplicity of kinases selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (or indeed any ACK) with a compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety;\n \n(2) contacting at least one non-kinase molecule having at least one accessible SH group with the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety (this step allows for the selection of inhibitors that have low selectivity for higher abundance biological molecules that have moieties that irreversibly react with the inhibitor; thus preventing the inhibitor from binding to the desire ACK when administered as a drug to a patient); and\n \n(3) determining the covalent binding of the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor with the multiplicity of kinases and the at least one non-kinase molecule; and\n \nrepeating steps (1), (2), and (3) for at least one other compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the following steps are added: (4) comparing the covalent binding of the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor with the multiplicity of kinases and the at least one non-kinase molecule; and repeating steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) for at least one other compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect the irreversible inhibitor compounds are also contacted with at least one non-ACK kinase in order to determine the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor compound for the ACK relative to the non-ACK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of certain relevant examples of non-kinase molecules with at least one accessible SH group are glutathione and/or hemoglobin. Because of the high abundance of these molecules in typical biological systems (e.g., in a patient), the desired irreversible inhibitor compounds have low selectivity/reactivity with these non-kinase molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, an Activity Probe (described in more detail herein) is used as a rapid diagnostic method for determining whether a test inhibitor compound has irreversibly inhibited an ACK. In one embodiment, the Activity Probe is itself an irreversible inhibitor of an ACK, and further, has a reporter moiety (e.g., a fluorescent moiety) as part of its structure. When used in competition with a test irreversible inhibitor, the absence of a ‘reporter’ signal on an ACK is one indication that the test irreversible inhibitor has prevented the Activity Probe from binding to the ACK (and that the test irreversible inhibitor has a higher binding affinity for the ACK than the Activity Probe).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, steps (1) and (2) are conducted in vivo and step (3) is conducted in part using an Activity Probe. Further, in certain embodiments, the determining step uses mass spectrometry, fluorescence, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, in one embodiment, the inhibitor tested with the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform comprise an active site binding moiety, a Michael acceptor moiety, and a linker moiety that links the Michael acceptor moiety to the active site binding moiety. For example, in such a scheme, the following information is collected and analyzed: the structure-function activity relationship between the structure of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety of each compound, and the binding and/or selectivity of each compound to at least one kinase. Further, in certain embodiments, structure of the active site binding moiety of each compound is not varied, whereas the structure of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety is varied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the inhibitors have the structure of Formula (VII):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nwherein\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n is a moiety that binds to the active site of a kinase, including a tyrosine kinase, further including a Btk kinase cysteine homolog;\n\n\nY is an optionally substituted group selected from among alkylene, heteroalkylene, arylene, heteroarylene, heterocycloalkylene, cycloalkylene, alkylenearylene, alkyleneheteroarylene, alkylenecycloalkylene, and alkyleneheterocycloalkylene;\n\n\nZ is C(═O), OC(═O), NHC(═O), NCH\n3\nC(═O), C(═S), S(═O)\nx\n, OS(═O)\nx\n, NHS(═O)\nx\n, where x is 1 or 2;\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \nare independently selected from among H, unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, unsubstituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, substituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n6\nheterocycloalkyl, and substituted C\n2\n-C\n6\nheterocycloalkyl; or\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \ntaken together form a bond; and\n\n\nR\n6 \nis H, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkoxyalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nhydroxyalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkoxyalkylaminoalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(aryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(heteroaryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n3\n-C\n8\ncycloalkyl), or C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn such a scheme, the following information is collected and analyzed: the structure-function activity relationship between the structure of Y—Z and/or\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nof each compound, and the binding and/or selectivity of each compound to at least one kinase.

In vitro profiling against a panel of greater than 100 kinases showed \nCompound\n 2 to be a highly potent and selective inhibitor of Tec family kinases, including, Btk, as well as Src family kinases. Without limiting the scope of the compositions and methods described herein, it is postulated that the structural basis for the selectivity is covalent modification of a non-catalytic cysteine residue (\nCys\n 481 in Btk) that is conserved in the ATP binding pocket of the Tec family and several other kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, in other embodiments, any irreversible Kinase Inhibitor that binds to the non-catalytic cysteine residue in the ATP binding pocket of a Kinase is used in the compounds and methods described herein.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthesis and Characterization of an Illustrative Activity Probe\n\n\n \n \n \nWithout limiting the scope of the compositions described herein, an illustrative probe was synthesized by attaching a bodipy FL fluorophore to an irreversible inhibitor via a piperazine linker. The piperazine linker served to maintain probe solubility and provided spatial separation between the fluorophore and the pyrazolopyrimidine core.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linkage formed is a stable linkage. In other embodiments, in the case where the conjugate comprises two components, the linker moiety forms a linkage, in some embodiments, a stable linkage, between the Kinase Inhibitor moiety and the reporter moiety. In some embodiments, the linker moiety is stable and provides the means to control and determine the distance between the Kinase Inhibitor moiety and the report moiety. Further, in some embodiments, the linker moiety is selected such that the probe's solubility is maintained. In some embodiments, the linker moiety is a piperazinyl moiety. In further embodiments, a piperazinyl-based linkage is formed by using a piperazine containing compound. In other embodiments, the number and order of units that comprise the linker moiety is selected such that the length between the first component and the second component, as well as the hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics of the linker is controlled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present context, spatial separation means a thermochemically and photochemically non-active distance-making group and in some embodiments is used to join two or more different moieties of the types defined above. In other embodiments, spacers are selected on the basis of a variety of characteristics including their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, molecular flexibility and length. The spacer, thus, in some embodiments, comprises a chain of carbon atoms optionally interrupted or terminated with one or more heteroatoms, such as oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, and/or sulphur atoms. Thus, in some embodiments, the spacer comprises one or more amide, ester, amino, ether, and/or thioether functionalities, and optionally aromatic or mono/polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, polyoxyethylene such as polyethylene glycol, oligo/polyamides such as poly-.α-alanine, polyglycine, polylysine, and peptides in general, oligosaccharides, oligo/polyphosphates. Moreover, in other embodiments, the spacer consists of combined units thereof. In further embodiments, the length of the spacer varies, taking into consideration the desired or necessary positioning and spatial orientation of the active/functional part of the Activity Probe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout limiting the scope of the compositions described herein, in some embodiments the reporter moiety is Bodipy. In the present context, the term reporter moiety means a group which is detectable either by itself or as a part of a detection series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the labeled Activity Probes described herein are purified by one or more procedures including, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography; anion- or cation-exchange chromatography (using, including but not limited to, DEAE SEPHAROSE); chromatography on silica; reverse phase HPLC; gel filtration (using, including but not limited to, SEPHADEX G-75); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; size-exclusion chromatography, metal-chelate chromatography; ultrafiltration/diafiltration; ethanol precipitation; ammonium sulfate precipitation; chromatofocusing; displacement chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (including but not limited to preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (including but not limited to ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction. In other embodiments, apparent molecular weight is estimated by GPC by comparison to globular protein standards (P\nROTEIN PURIFICATION METHODS, A PRACTICAL APPROACH \n(Harris & Angal, Eds.) IRL Press 1989, 293-306).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the in vitro inhibitory potency of a probe against a panel of selected Kinases as a rapid means of confirming accessibility of the reactive moiety to the Kinase active site is tested. By way of example only, although less potent than the \nparent Compound\n 2, the illustrative probe of \nCompound\n 3 retains potency against Btk (IC\n50\n˜90 nM). Thus, the piperazine linker and bodipy fluorophore do not seriously compromise accessibility of the illustrative probe to the enzyme active site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Activity Probes described herein label kinases at the non-catalytic Cys 481 (or a homologous cysteine) and that in some embodiments, probe labeling does not require the catalytic machinery per se. As such it differs from canonical activity-based probes that target the enzyme catalytic machinery directly. In some embodiments, the Kinase undergoes a phosphorylation dependent conformational change that is tightly coupled to ATP binding and kinase activation. In some embodiments, effective labeling by a probe requires the Kinase to be in its active conformation in order to directly detect Kinase activity in cells. In other embodiments, effective labeling by a Activity Probe does not require the Kinase to be in its active conformation in order to directly detect Kinase activity in cells.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Uses of Irreversible Inhibitor Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are methods, compositions, uses and medicaments for the treatment of disorders comprising administering to a patient in need an irreversible inhibitor of an ACK. In some embodiments, the ACK is Btk or a Btk homolog. In further embodiments, the ACK is Blk or a Blk homolog.

Dey et al. (2006), Cytojournal 3(24), and the “Revised European American Lymphoma” (REAL) classification system (see, e.g., the website maintained by the National Cancer Institute).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of animal models are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of irreversible inhibitors, including irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases. For example, refer to Examples 1-4 of the “Therapeutic Uses” section of the Examples included herein. Also, for example, dosing of irreversible inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthitis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar et al. (2003), \nAm. J. Pathol \n163:1827-1837. In another example, dosing of irreversible inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative disorders can be examined in, e.g., a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g. Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodefficient mice (e.g., “nude” mice) as described in, e.g., Pagel et al. (2005), Clin Cancer Res 11(13):4857-4866. Animal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the therapeutic efficacy of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases is optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated optionally undergoes a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. Cellular assays are used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells are used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et al. (1999), \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA \n96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the Btk inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject is optionally increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are methods for identifying biomarkers suitable for determining patient response to an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) comprising administering to a test subject a composition containing an amount of the irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) sufficient to inhibit B cell receptor signaling and correlating B cell receptor signaling with apoptosis. In another or further embodiment are methods for selecting a patient for treatment for lymphoma with an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) comprising measuring pErk or Erk transcriptional target levels in a patient sample, and correlating a high level of transcriptional targets with a positive response to the treatment. In another or further embodiments are methods for measuring a patient's response to treatment comprising administering to the patient an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)), measuring pErk or Erk transcriptional target levels in a patient sample, and correlating a reduced level of transcriptional targets with a positive response to the administration of the irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)).\n\n\n \nCombination Treatments\n\n\n \n \n \nThe irreversible Btk inhibitor compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and are optionally, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The initial administration is made, for example, according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration are modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, it is appropriate to administer at least one irreversible Btk inhibitor compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is in some embodiments simply additive of the two therapeutic agents or in other embodiments, the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds are optionally administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is based on an evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formula (A1-A6), (B1-B6), (C1-C6), or (D1-D6) described herein) are optionally administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are optionally provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compounds described herein also are optionally used in combination with procedures that provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, or within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound should be administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, between about 1 month to about 5 years, or from about 1 month to about 3 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary Therapeutic Agents for Use in Combination with an Irreversible Inhibitor Compound\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the subject is suffering from or at risk of suffering from an autoimmune disease, an inflammatory disease, or an allergy disease, an irreversible Btk inhibitor compound can be used in with one or more of the following therapeutic agents in any combination: immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporin, rapamicin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate, or FTY720), glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone, cortisone acetate, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, beclometasone, fludrocortisone acetate, deoxycorticosterone acetate, aldosterone), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., salicylates, arylalkanoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids, N-arylanthranilic acids, oxicams, coxibs, or sulphonanilides), Cox-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., valdecoxib, celecoxib, or rofecoxib), leflunomide, gold thioglucose, gold thiomalate, aurofin, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquinine, minocycline, TNF-α binding proteins (e.g., infliximab, etanercept, or adalimumab), abatacept, anakinra, interferon-β, interferon-γ, interleukin-2, allergy vaccines, antihistamines, antileukotrienes, beta-agonists, theophylline, anticholinergics or other selective kinase inhibitors (e.g p38 inhibitors, Syk inhibitors, PKC inhibitors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the subject is suffering from or at risk of suffering from a B-cell proliferative disorder (e.g., plasma cell myeloma), the subjected can be treated with an irreversible Btk inhibitor compound in any combination with one or more other anti-cancer agents.

(Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “measurable serum concentration” or “measurable plasma concentration” describes the blood serum or blood plasma concentration, typically measured in mg, μg, or ng of therapeutic agent per ml, dl, or l of blood serum, absorbed into the bloodstream after administration. As used herein, measurable plasma concentrations are typically measured in ng/ml or μg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmacodynamics” refers to the factors which determine the biologic response observed relative to the concentration of drug at a site of action. “Pharmacokinetics” refers to the factors which determine the attainment and maintenance of the appropriate concentration of drug at a site of action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Steady state,” as used herein, is when the amount of drug administered is equal to the amount of drug eliminated within one dosing interval resulting in a plateau or constant plasma drug exposure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein, which include a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) can be formulated into any suitable dosage form, including but not limited to, aqueous oral dispersions, liquids, gels, syrups, elixirs, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated, solid oral dosage forms, aerosols, controlled release formulations, fast melt formulations, effervescent formulations, lyophilized formulations, tablets, powders, pills, dragees, capsules, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, multiparticulate formulations, and mixed immediate release and controlled release formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical solid dosage forms described herein optionally include a compound described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as a compatible carrier, binder, filling agent, suspending agent, flavoring agent, sweetening agent, disintegrating agent, dispersing agent, surfactant, lubricant, colorant, diluent, solubilizer, moistening agent, plasticizer, stabilizer, penetration enhancer, wetting agent, anti-foaming agent, antioxidant, preservative, or one or more combination thereof. In still other aspects, using standard coating procedures, such as those described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n20th Edition (2000), a film coating is provided around the formulation of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII). In one embodiment, some or all of the particles of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), are coated. In another embodiment, some or all of the particles of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), are microencapsulated. In still another embodiment, the particles of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), are not microencapsulated and are uncoated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that benefit, at least in part, from inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactically effective amount or dose.” In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered to the patient on a regular basis, e.g., three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day or every 3 days. In other embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered to the patient on an intermittent basis, e.g., twice a day followed by once a day followed by three times a day; or the first two days of every week; or the first, second and third day of a week. In some embodiments, intermittent dosing is as effective as regular dosing. In further or alternative embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered only when the patient exhibits a particular symptom, e.g., the onset of pain, or the onset of a fever, or the onset of an inflammation, or the onset of a skin disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, and is determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.\n\n\n \nDosing Strategies to Increase Selectivity\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are irreversible kinase inhibitors that are selective for one or more ACKs, including a Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog. In some embodiments, the irreversible inhibitors described herein also bind reversibly to other kinases (some of which, in some embodiments, are also ACKs). As a means of enhancing the selectivity profile, such inhibitors are formulated (formulation includes chemical modifications of the inhibitor, use of excipients in a pharmaceutical composition, and combinations thereof) such that the pharmacokinetic profile favors enhanced selectivity of the inhibitors for an ACK over a non-ACK. By way of example only, an ACK is formulated to have a short plasma half-life. In other embodiments, an ACK is formulated to have an extended plasma half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, as shown in the Examples, \nCompound\n 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, \nCompound\n 7 and \nCompound\n 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life (\nFIG. 5\n). Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited. Further, given that the irreversible kinase inhibitors described herein have both reversible (in general to non-ACKs) and irreversible (generally, to ACKs) activities, in vivo properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) are selected in order to optimize the therapeutic index. Specifically, in some embodiments, rapidly cleared compounds cause only brief inhibition of reversibly inhibited targets while maintaining sustained inhibition of irreversibly inhibited targets. Depending on the degree to which sustained inhibition of particular targets results in therapeutic effects or toxicities, we identify compounds with an optimal combination of in vitro selectivity profiles and in vivo ADME properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are kinase inhibitors that selectively and irreversibly binds to a protein tyrosine kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog, in which the kinase inhibitor reversibly and non-selectively binds to a multiplicity of protein tyrosine kinases, and further in which the plasma half life of the kinase inhibitor is less than about 4 hours. In such an embodiment, the kinase inhibitor selectively and irreversibly binds to at least one of Btk, Jak3, Blk, Bmx, Tec, and Itk.

Briefly, 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (48 g) is added to thionyl chloride (100 mL) and heated under gentle reflux for 1 hour. Thionyl chloride is removed by distillation, the residual oil dissolved in toluene and volatile material removed at 80° C./20 mbar. The resulting acid chloride is dissolved in toluene (200 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (35 mL). Malononitrile (14.8 g) is added and the solution and stirred at −10° C. while adding diisopropylethylethylamine (57.9 g) in toluene (150 mL), while maintaining the temperature below 0° C. After 1 hour at 0° C., the mixture is stirred at 20° C. overnight. Amine hydrochloride is removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with 1.25 M sulphuric acid, then with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents gives a semisolid residue which is treated with a little ethyl acetate to give 4.1 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a white solid (m.p. 160-162° C.). The filtrate on evaporation gives 56.58 (96%) of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a grey-brown solid, which is sufficiently pure for further use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1,1-Dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (56.5 g) in acetonitrile (780 mL) and methanol (85 mL) is stirred under nitrogen at 0° C. while adding diisopropylethylamine (52.5 mL) followed by 2M trimethylsilyldiazomethane (150 mL) in THF. The reaction is stirred for 2 days at 20° C., and then 2 g of silica is added (for chromatography). The brown-red solution is evaporated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed well with water then brine, dried and evaporated. The residue is extracted with diethyl ether (3×250 mL), decanting from insoluble oil. Evaporation of the ether extracts gives 22.5 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a pale orange solid. The insoluble oil is purified by flash chromatography to give 15.0 g of a red-orange oil. 1,1-Dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (22.5 g) and 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene oil (15 g) are treated with a solution of hydrazine hydrate (18 mL) in ethanol (25 mL) and heated on the steambath for 1 hour. Ethanol (15 mL) is added followed by water (10 mL). The precipitated solid is collected and washed with ethanol:water (4:1) and then dried in air to give 3-amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole as a pale orange solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3-Amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole (29.5 g) is suspended in formamide (300 mL) and heated under nitrogen at 180° C. for 4 hours.

A variety of lymphoma cell lines were incubated with a range of concentrations of \nCompound\n 1 to determine the GI50, the concentration that results in 50% decrease in cell proliferation (\nFIG. 1A\n). \nCompound\n 1 inhibits tumor growth in DOHH2 and DLCL2 xenograft models (\nFIGS. 1B and 1C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vitro cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media (in most cases RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and \nCompound\n 1 was added in a 9-point dilution series ranging from 10 uM to 0.04 uM with DMSO at 0.1% final concentration in all wells. After 72 hours, cell number was measured using Alamar Blue using manufacturer's protocol. A dilution series of untreated cells was run in parallel to verify that the Alamar Blue assay reliably reflected cell number and that growth conditions were not limiting. The GI50, the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell number, was calculated using Calcusyn to fit the dose-response curve. GI50 values were confirmed in two or more separate experiments for each cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo lymphoma xenograft studies, 5E6 DOHH2 or DLCL2 cells in 50% matrigel were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice and dosed orally with \nCompound\n 1 beginning when tumor size reached 100 mm2.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nInhibition of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in a Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits collagen-induced arthritis in the mouse. Male DBA/1O1aHsd mice were injected intradermally with 150 microliters of 2 mg/mL Type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant with supplemental \nM. tuberculosis, \n4 mg/mL and boosted with the same injection 21 days later. After paw inflammation was established, animals were randomized and \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle was dosed orally once per day starting at \nday\n 1. Paw inflammation was scored from 0-5 and averaged across all paws from all animals for each group in the study. \nCompound\n 1 at 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg regressed inflammation through the end of the study (day 11) while 3.125 mg/kg significantly reduced the increase in paw inflammation (\nFIG. 2\n). Dexamethasone was included as a positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another study, \nCompound\n 1 was dosed at 12.5 mg/kg to such mice over: (a) each day of an 11-day period; (b) \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3 of an 11-day period; or (c) \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 9, 10, and 11 of an 11-day period. Intermittent dosing reduced the increase in paw inflammation. In addition, \nCompound\n 9 was dosed to such mice at a level of 12.5 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg each day of an 11-day period. \nCompound\n 9 reduced the increase in paw inflammation.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nInhibition of Lupus in a Mouse Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits disease progression in the mouse MRL/lpr model of lupus. \nCompound\n 1 at 3.125 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg significantly reduced proteinuria, indicating amelioration of the progressive autoimmune renal failure seen in this mouse strain (\nFIG. 3\n). MRL/lpr mice (Jax strain 000485) were dosed orally once per day from 12 weeks of age until 20 weeks of age and urine protein levels were measured weekly using Clinitech Multistick dipstick.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nInhibition of Mast Cell Degranulation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits mast cell degranulation in a mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. Increasing doses of \nCompound\n 1 significantly decrease the amount of Evans Blue release, indicating decreased mast cell activation and vascular permeabilization. (\nFIG. 4\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE in the back. 23 hours later they received a single oral dose of \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle. After one hour, animals were challenged with an intravenous injection of DNP-BSA and Evans Blue dye. Mast cell degranulation leads to vascular permeability and the distribution of the dye into the skin of the back. The area of extravasation after 1 hour is measured.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions described below are presented with a compound of Formula (A1-A6) for illustrative purposes; any of the compounds of any of Formulas (A1-A6), (B1-B6), (C1-C6), or (D1-D6) are optionally used in such pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \nExample 5a\n\n\nParenteral Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a parenteral pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration by injection, 100 mg of a water-soluble salt of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is dissolved in DMSO and then mixed with 10 mL of 0.9% sterile saline. The mixture is incorporated into a dosage unit form suitable for administration by injection.\n\n\n \nExample 5b\n\n\nOral Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for oral delivery, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 750 mg of starch.

The mixture is gently blended and poured into a mold to form a lozenge suitable for buccal administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5d\n\n\nInhalation Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for inhalation delivery, 20 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 50 mg of anhydrous citric acid and 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The mixture is incorporated into an inhalation delivery unit, such as a nebulizer, which is suitable for inhalation administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5e\n\n\nRectal Gel Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for rectal delivery, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 2.5 g of methylcellulose (1500 mPa), 100 mg of methylparaben, 5 g of glycerin and 100 mL of purified water. The resulting gel mixture is then incorporated into rectal delivery units, such as syringes, which are suitable for rectal administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5f\n\n\nTopical Gel Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical topical gel composition, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 1.75 g of hydroxypropyl cellulose, 10 mL of propylene glycol, 10 mL of isopropyl myristate and 100 mL of purified alcohol USP. The resulting gel mixture is then incorporated into containers, such as tubes, which are suitable for topical administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5g\n\n\nOphthalmic Solution Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical ophthalmic solution composition, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 0.9 g of NaCl in 100 mL of purified water and filtered using a 0.2 micron filter. The resulting isotonic solution is then incorporated into ophthalmic delivery units, such as eye drop containers, which are suitable for ophthalmic administration.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nLevels of Tonic BCR Signaling Predict Response to \nCompound\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify biomarkers that correlate with response to \nCompound\n 1, phosphorylation events in the BCR signal transduction pathway were investigated. A panel of phospho-specific antibodies that recognize activating phosphorylation sites on Syk, Btk, BLNK, PLC-g1, PLC-g2, ERK, and AKT were used and tested the effects of \nCompound\n 4 on both basal phosphorylation and phosphorylation following BCR stimulation driven by anti-IgM or anti-IgG cross-linking. We examined phosphorylation patterns in both a \nCompound\n 1 sensitive cell line (DOHH2) and a \nCompound\n 1 resistant cell line (Ramos).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits most BCR-stimulus induced phosphorylation events with similar potency in both cell lines. However, when we examined basal phosphorylation levels, we found higher basal phosphorylation in DOHH2 compared to Ramos, with phospho-ERK in particular indicating higher levels of basal or tonic signaling in DOHH2. Furthermore, \nCompound\n 4 significantly decreased pERK levels in unstimulated DOHH2 cells (IC50<10 nM), but not in Ramos cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA panel of nine Btk expressing B cell lymphoma cell lines was screened for basal pERK levels. Seven lines expressed significantly higher levels of basal pERK, and of these, 5 were sensitive to Compound 1 (GI50<1.3 uM), while the two cell lines with low pERK levels were resistant to \nCompound\n 1. This data shows that tonic BCR signaling contributes to the survival of a subset of lymphoma cell lines, and that inhibition of this signaling by \nCompound\n 4 is correlated with induction of apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo additional experiments demonstrate that sensitivity to \nCompound\n 1 is correlated with high levels of pERK. First 1 uM of \nCompound\n 4 reduces expression of the known ERK transcriptional target Egr-1 within 1 hr, with maximal downregulation (10-fold) achieved by 4 hr. Second, in the lymphoma cell line WSU-DLCL2, BCR cross-linking by anti-IgG (30 ug/ml) overcomes inhibition of pERK by \nCompound\n 4, showing that strong BCR stimulus activates parallel pathways to pERK that do not require Btk. BCR stimulus also rescues WSU-DLCL2 from \nCompound\n 1 induced cytotoxicity, further confirming that inhibition of pERK is correlated with apoptosis induction by \nCompound\n 1. Taken together these data show high levels of pERK or ERK transcriptional targets such as Egr-1 serve as useful markers for lymphomas in which tonic BCR signaling is contributing to cell survival and that these lymphomas are particularly sensitive to BCR pathway inhibitors such as \nCompound\n 1.\n\n\n \nKinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform and Pulse Dosing\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nDesign of an Inhibitor\n\n\n \n \n \nBecause the ATP binding sites of the >500 kinases in the human genome are highly conserved, it has proven difficult to engineer selectivity for individual kinases using conventional reversible binding inhibitors. For our highly selective \nBTK inhibitor Compound\n 1, we engineered an electrophilic center capable of irreversibly inactivating the target enzyme, BTK. The approach employed structure based design to achieve a high degree of potency and selectivity by (1) fitting the core scaffold into the active site ATP binding pocket of kinase enzymes, and (2) forming a covalent bond with Cysteine-481 located in BTK. The unique chemistry required for covalent bond formation involves an electrophilic moiety that acts as a Michael acceptor, which bonds with a nucleophile (such as Cys-481) present in a precise location within the active site.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nInhibitor Screening Approach\n\n\n \n \n \nBy way of example only, a panel of 50-100 Cys-targeting kinase inhibitors is generated. The molecular orientation and positioning of the electrophilic group in these inhibitors in relation to the Cysteine residue will affect the potency and selectivity of a given inhibitor. Each inhibitor will then be profiled for kinetics of kinase inhibition (K\ni\n) for each of the ten Cys-containing kinases, effect on tumor cell proliferation (GI\n50\n), effect on relevant off-targets (hERG, CYPs), drug-like characteristics (solubility, clogP) and ability to block labeling by the active site probe. This panel of diverse inhibitors are then be used in cell assays (for example, inhibition of tumor growth) to screen for a phenotype of interest. With the phenotype, the identification of additional inhibited kinases is determined using the active site probe and mass spectrometry.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nInhibition of a Panel of Kinases for \nCompound\n 1 and \nCompound\n 9\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another example, the linker and Michael acceptor moiety of Compound 1 was modified to provide \nCompound\n 9 which has a different selectivity pattern. Table 1 is a table showing the degree of inhibition of a panel of kinases for two example compounds. IC\n50\ns were determined using the in vitro HotSpot kinase assay (purified enzymes, \n33\nP-ATP, an appropriate substrate and 1 uM ATP.) Compared to Compound 1, Compound 9 has similar potency toward Btk, but significantly less potency toward JAK-3, ITK, and EGFR and significantly more potency toward the src-family kinases lck, c-src, FGR, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn and Yes. Thus, subtle modifications in the linker moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety are important for the design of selective ACK inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCompound\n 1\n\n\nCompound 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKinase\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBTK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nITK\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n909.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBmx/ETK\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTEC\n\n\n77.8\n\n\n108.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEFGR\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER2\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n1536.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER4\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLCK\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBLK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC-src\n\n\n262.6\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFGR\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFyn\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHCK\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLyn\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYES\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nABL\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n32.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBrk\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSK\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFER\n\n\n8,070.0\n\n\n3,346.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAK3\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n8,278.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYK\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nModification of Linker and Michael Acceptor Moieties and In Vitro Inhibitory Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example, compounds are selected based on in vitro characteristics to optimize for potency of inhibition of particular kinases and degree of covalent binding to off-target cysteines such as glutathione. For example, in Table 2, \nCompound\n 9 and Compound 12 both inhibit Btk with a similar potency as \nCompound\n 1, but they are both significantly less potent inhibitors of EGFR, ITK, and JAK-3. As another example, \nCompound\n 11 is similar to \nCompound\n 1 for inhibition of Btk but does not bind glutathione as readily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA calculated value (e.g (1/Btk IC\n50\n)/Glutathione conjugation rate) as shown in the Table 2) is used to compare compounds for their ratio between potency at inhibiting their target and their non-specific binding to other SH groups, such as those in glutathione. As shown in Table 2, this calculated value is 4.7 for \nCompound\n 1 and for 239.6 for \nCompound\n 11. Calculated ratios such as these are used to quantitatively compare different compounds and select compounds for further study.\n\n\n \nExample 4a\n\n\nEnzyme Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nFor enzyme inhibition assays, compounds were tested in range of ten concentrations from 10 uM to 0.0005 uM using purified enzymes and the Hotspot kinase assay. Reaction conditions were 1 uM ATP, one hour incubation with inhibitor, and kinase activity detected using 33-ATP phosphorylation of an appropriately selected peptide substrate. Dose-response curves were fit using Prism, and the IC\n50\n, the concentration at which enzyme inhibition is 50% of maximal inhibition, was determined See Table 2.\n\n\n \nExample 4b\n\n\nGlutathione Binding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the glutathione binding assays, 5 mM glutathione, 10 μM Btk inhibitor in DMSO (10 μL) and 6 equivalents of N′N′ Diisopropyl ethyl amine were combined in 1 mL potassium phosphate buffer. The mixture was incubated for 0, 15, 60 minutes at room temperature and the reaction was stopped with 10 equivalents of formic acid. 50 μL of each reaction mixture was injected on HPLC (Mobil Phase A: 0.2% formic acid in water, Mobile Phase B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile, HPLC Column: Metasil Basic 3μ, 150×4.6 mm, 10% B, Gradient:10% to 90% B, Detection: UV/Vis 260 nM). Rate of reaction was reported as nmole GSH conjugate conversion per minute from the normalized ratio for area under the curve from HPLC chromatograms for both GSH conjugate and the parent.\n\n\n \nExample 4c\n\n\nCell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nAnalogs are generated that are Btk inhibitors and that are cytotoxic to the lymphoma cell line DOHH2. See Table 2. For the DOHH2 cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media (RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and compounds were added in a 9-point dilution series ranging from 10 uM to 0.04 uM with DMSO at 0.1% final concentration in all wells. After 72 hours, cell number was measured using Alamar Blue using manufacturer's protocol. A dilution series of untreated cells was run in parallel to verify that the Alamar Blue assay reliably reflected cell number and that growth conditions were not limiting. The GI\n50\n, the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell number, was calculated using Calcusyn to fit the dose-response curve.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1/BTK\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBTK\n\n\nITK\n\n\nEGFR\n\n\nLCK\n\n\nJAK3\n\n\nGlutathione\n\n\nIC\n50\n)/\n\n\nDOHH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nConj Rate\n\n\nGlutathione\n\n\n2 GI\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nmol/min)\n\n\nRate\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n0.398\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n \n\n\n48.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n74.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n \n\n\n487.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n326.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.004\n\n\n44.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n \n\n\n60.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n6,123\n\n\n268.7\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n15.9\n\n\n0.317\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n \n\n\n83.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n909.9\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n8278.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n1954\n\n\n44.5\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n6891\n\n\n18.85\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.004525\n\n\n239.6\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n14290\n\n\n698.3\n\n\n5.97\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.004361\n\n\n172.2\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n3013\n\n\n18.75\n\n\n1.56\n\n\n12980\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n592.3\n\n\n2.298\n\n\n9.24\n\n\n1456\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.16\n\n\n21100\n\n\n289.4\n\n\n5.90\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.14\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n2807\n\n\n3.82\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2333\n\n\n435.3\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.0243\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n2536\n\n\n22.53\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n534.6\n\n\n28.22\n\n\n6.62\n\n\n5997\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.07\n\n\n7993\n\n\n303.60\n\n\n98.59\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.15\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n6238.00\n\n\n1346\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n3691\n\n\n156.30\n\n\n22.12\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n45.4\n\n\n<0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n830\n\n\n70.49\n\n\n208.00\n\n\n3306.00\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.89\n\n\n476\n\n\n383.70\n\n\n235.40\n\n\n9077.00\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.48\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n272.90\n\n\n25.81\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nKinase Inhibitor Selectivity Predicted by Dosing\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, \nCompound\n 7 and \nCompound\n 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life (\nFIG. 5\n). Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale jugular vein cannulated rats were administered a single dose of all test compounds at 8 mg/kg each, in combination by oral gavage. Dose volumes were adjusted based on body weight data collected immediately prior to dosing. Blood samples were collected at 0.0833 (5 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours post-dosing from orally dosed rats. The samples were collected into plasma separator Microtainer tubes with anticoagulant (lithium heparin). Plasma samples were prepared by centrifugation (5 min at 5000×g), and at least 100 μL were transferred to storage tubes and stored frozen at −80° C. Plasma samples were thawed and 75 uL aliquots were transferred to centrifuge tubes to which 10 μL aliquots of internal standard solution (1 μg/mL) were added. The samples were not diluted with blank plasma prior to further processing. Soluble proteins were precipitated by the addition of 200 μL of acetonitrile, followed by centrifugation (20 min at 16,000×g). The samples were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 200 μL of water containing 0.2% formic acid and 10% methanol. All samples were loaded onto an autosampler maintained at 6° C. and evaluated for concentrations of test compounds using LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nB Cell Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nBrief exposure to \nCompound\n 1 in vitro is sufficient to inhibit B cell activation in normal human B cells (\nFIG. 6\n). This protocol mimics the predicted exposure of cells to \nCompound\n 1 in vivo and demonstrates that inhibition of B cells is sustained despite washing out of \nCompound\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cells were purified from blood from healthy donors by negative selecting using the RosetteSep Human B cell enrichment cocktail. Cells were plated in growth media (10% RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and indicated concentrations of \nCompound\n 1 were added. After incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed three times using an 8-fold dilution in growth media for each wash. Cells were then stimulated with 10 ug/ml of IgM F(ab′)2 for 18 hours at 37° C. Cells were then stained with anti-CD69-PE antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry using standard conditions.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nOptimizing the Therapeutic Index of Kinase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nGiven that kinase inhibitors described above will have both reversible and irreversible activities, we select their in vivo properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in order to optimize the therapeutic index. Specifically, rapidly cleared compounds are expected to cause only brief inhibition of reversibly inhibited targets while maintaining sustained inhibition of irreversibly inhibited targets. Depending on the degree to which sustained inhibition of particular targets results in therapeutic effects or toxicities, we identify compounds with an optimal combination of in vitro selectivity profiles and in vivo ADME properties."
