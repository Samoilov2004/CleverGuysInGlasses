They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTMl) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPCl (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPVl, TRPV2, TRPV3 or TRPV4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRP V3 and is more closely related to TRPVl and TRPV2 than to TRP V5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPMl (melastatin or LTRPCl), TRPM3 (KIAAl 616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMRl), TRPM5 (MTRl or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPMLl (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPPl (PKDl, PCl), PKD-REJ and PKD-ILl are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTMl. \n\n It is believed TRPAl is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPAl is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice.TRPAl is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson LJ et al, Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAl ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAl receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAl is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals\n\n\nThe difference between TRPAl and other TRP receptors is that TRPAl ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required.\n\n\nWO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions.\n\n\nIn efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPAl.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I) \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein,\n\n\nR\n1\n and R\n2\n , which may be the same or different, are independenly selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, (CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\nOR\nx\n, COR\nX\n, COOR\nX\n, CONR\nx\nR\ny\n, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nNR\nx\nR\ny\n, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCHR\nx\nR\ny\n and (CH\n2\n)\nn\nNHCOR\nx\n;\n\n\nR\n3\n is selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyl;\n\n\nL is a linker selected from -(CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\n-, -O-(CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\n-, -C(O)-, -NR\nX\n-, -S(O)\nm\nNR\nx\n-, -NR\nx\n(CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\n- and -S(O)\nm\nNR\nx\n(CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\n;\n\n\nZi and Z\n2\n are independently sulfur or CR\na\n;

For instance, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are suitable for treatment or prophylaxis of the following diseases, conditions and disorders mediated or associated with the activity of TRPAl receptors: pain, chronic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritic pain, osteoarthritic pain, back pain, visceral pain, cancer pain, algesia, neuralgia, migraine, neuropathies, chemotherapy - induced neuropathies, eye - irritation, bronchial - irritation, skin - irritation (atopic dermatitis), Frost - bites (cold - bite), spasticity, catatonia, catalepsy, parkinsons, diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, HIV-related neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration, stroke, post stroke pain, multiple sclerosis, respiratory diseases, asthma, cough, COPD, inflammatory disorders, oesophagitis, gastroeosophagal reflux disorder (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic hypersensitivity, urinary incontinence, cystitis, burns, psoriasis, eczema, emesis, stomach duodenal ulcer and pruritus. The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPAl is illustrated, for example, in Story, G. M. et al. Cell, 2003, 112, 819-829; McMahon, S.B. and Wood, J. N., Cell, 2006, 124, 1123-1125; Voorhoeve, P. M. et al. Cell, 2006, 124, 1169-1181; Wissenbach, U, Niemeyer, B. A. and Flockerzi, V. Biology of the Cell, 2004, 96, 47-54; and the references cited therein.\n\n\nPain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in \n\n Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett & F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed., 1996, 100-107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as \"nociceptors\". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and Aδ fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal and proton (pH<6) modalities. Nociceptors are the nerves which sense and respond to parts of the body which suffer from damage. They signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain.\n\n\nChronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited).\n\n\nGeneral Methods of Preparation\n\n\nThe compounds described herein, including compounds of general formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Id) and specific examples are prepared using techniques known to one skilled in the art through the reaction sequences depicted in Schemes 1-10 as well as by other methods. Furthermore, in the following Synthetic schemes, where specific acids, bases, reagents, coupling agents, solvents, etc. are mentioned, it is understood that other suitable acids, bases, reagents, coupling agents etc. may be used and are included within the scope of the present invention. The compounds obtained by using the general reaction sequences may be of insufficient purity. These compounds can be purified by using any of the methods for purification of organic compounds known to persons skilled in the art, for example, crystallization or silica gel or alumina column chromatography using different solvents in suitable ratios. All possible stereoisomers are envisioned within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of thienopyrimidinyl acetamides of the general formula (I), wherein Z\n1\n, Z\n2\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, U, V and L are as defined above in \n\n description is prepared as described in Scheme 1. Coupling reaction of the compounds of the formula (1) with amines of the formula (2) in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) and base in suitable solvent gives compounds of the formula (3). The selective N-alkylation of the compounds of the formula (3) with suitable alkylating agent of the formula (4) in the presence of base and solvent gives compounds of the general formula (I).\n\n\nScheme 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of thieno[2,3-<i]pyrimidinyl acetamides of the general formula (Ia'), wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, U and V are as defined above is prepared as described in Scheme 2. Synthesis starts from commercially available 1,3-dialkylbarbituric acid of the formula (5). The known 6-chloro-5-formyl-l,3-dimethyluracil (6) is prepared according to the reported procedure (Singh, J. S. et al, Synthesis 1988, 342-344) by formylation of intermediate (5) with POCI3 and DMF. The treatment of 6-chloro-5- formyl-l,3-dialkyluracil (6) with hydroxylamine in methanol followed by dehydration with phosphorous oxychloride give ό-chloro-S-cyano-l^-dimethyluracil of formula (7). Treatment of compounds of the formula (7) with alkyl mercaptoacetate of the formula (8) (wherein R is alkyl) in the presence of suitable base affords amino ester of the formula (9) through a coupling reaction followed by insitu cyclization. This conversion is similar to described by Motoi, Y. et al, J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1990, 717-721. The amino ester (9) on diazotization followed by halide substitution with copper halide (such as copper bromide or copper iodide) affords an intermediate of the formula (10) where X is halogen. Aryl halide of formula (10) on reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (11) in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(O) gives allyl derivative of the formula (12) [e.g. a procedure similar to the Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling described by Kotha, et al, Synlett 2005, 12, 1877-1890]. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of allyl thiophene derivative of the formula (12) using copper in the \n\n presence of quinoline at elevated temperature gives the allyl thienopyrimidinedione of the formula (14) [procedure is similar to that is reported by Ludo., E. J. Kennis. et al in Biorg. & Med. Chem. Lett, 2000, 10, 71-74, and Mashraqui, S. H. et al, in Tetrahedron, 2005, 61, 3507-3513]. Ozonolysis of compounds of the formula (14) in methanol under basic condition followed by hydrolysis of the ester (15) with aqueous acid gave compounds of the formula (16). (This conversion is similar to described by Mohler, D. L. et al, Synthesis, 2002, 745-748). The coupling of compounds of formula (16) with respective amines of formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ia').\n\n\nScheme 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(15) (16) (Ia\n1\n)\n\n\nAn approach for the synthesis of thieno[2,3-ύT|pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ia) wherein R\na\n is an alkyl group (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl) and R\n1\n, R\n2\n, U and V are as defined above is shown in Scheme 3. Functionalized thiophene of the formula (18) is prepared by a one pot 3 -component coupling reaction (Gewald's synthesis) using malononitrile, appropriate aldehyde and sulfur powder (Byrn, S. R. et al, J. Pharm, ScL, 2001, 90, 371). The compound of the formula (18) is converted into compounds of formula (19) by a sequence of transformations well known in the art of organic synthesis. Cyclisation of compounds of the formula (19) with triphosgene gave \n\n the compounds of the formula (20), which on selective N-alkylation afforded compounds of the formula (21). Halogenation of formula (21) (e.g., N-bromosuccinimide or N- iodosuccinimide in the presence of BF3-etherate or trifluromethanesulphonic acid) gave compounds of the formula (22). This conversion is according to procedure reported by George, O. L. et al, J. Am. Chem. soc, 2004, 126, 15770-15776. Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling of aryl halide of the formula (22) with allyl boronic acids of formula (11) in the presence of Pd (0) affords allyl thiophene of the formula (23) as described in scheme 1. Transformation of compounds of formula (23) into compounds of formula (24) can be accomplished by methods known to those skilled in the art [e.g., Postema, M. H. D. et al. in J. Org. Chem., 2003, 68, 4748-4754]. The compounds of the formula (24) can be converted to compounds of the formula (25) by oxidation methods well known in the literature.

The known 6-methyluracil derivative (26) can be prepared by two different methods. In one approach NN-dimethyl urea is condensed with acetic anhydride in presence of pyridine as reported by Egg, H. et al in Synthesis, 1982, 1071-1073. Alternatively, intermediate (26) can be prepared by alkylation of 6-methyluracil according to the procedure reported by Siverman, R. B. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1982, 104, 6434-6439. Friedel-Crafts acylation of intermediate (26) in the presence of catalytic \n\n amount of Lewis acid e.g., ZnCl\n2\n gives compounds of the formula (27). A similar procedure is reported by Tsupak, E.

Reaction of compounds of formula (28) with dialkyl carbonate in the presence of suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent gives the diester of the formula (29). Dealkoxycarbonylation of compounds of the formula (29) using suitable base such as sodium hydride or using DMSO/NaCl/water afforded desired thieno[3,4- βT]pyrimidinedione ester of the formula (30).

The uracil derivative (26) prepared as describe in Scheme 4 is treated with alkyl halide of the formula R\na\nX in the presence of a suitable base such as lithium diisopropyl amide gives compounds of the formula (31). Similar approach is reported by Hiriyakkanavar, J. et al in Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33 (41), 6173-6176]. Friedel-Crafts acylation of intermediates of the formula (31) gives the ketone (32). Cyclisation of the compounds of the formula (32) by Gewald's synthesis gives the desired thieno[3,4-<i]pyrimidinedione of the formula (33). Compounds of formula (33) can be converted to ester of the formula (34) by reaction of (33) with \n\n dialkyl carbonate in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride followed by dealkoxycarbonylation as described in Scheme 4. Coupling reaction of ester of the formula (34) with appropriate amines of formula (2) by using suitable base such as sodium hydride in the presence of suitable solvent such as dry toluene or xylene gives compounds of general formula (Ib).\n\n\nScheme 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach for the synthesis of thieno[3,4-t/]pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ib') wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, U and V are as defined above is shown in Scheme 6. Formylation of uracil derivative (26) with phosphorous oxychloride and dry DMF gave 5- formyl derivative of the formula (35) as described by Shirahashi, M. et al, in Yakugaku Zasshi, 1971, 91, 1372. Treatment of 5-formyl derivative (35) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride followed by dehydration with phosphorous oxychloride gave 5-cyano derivative of the formula (36). A similar approach is reported by Hirota, K. et al in Heteocycle, 1998, 47, 871-882). Aminothiophene of the formula (37) is obtained by reaction of intermediate of formula (36) with sulfur powder and morpholine under Gewald's reaction conditions. Amino thiophene (37) on diazotization followed by halide substitution with a metal halide such as copper bromide or copper iodide affords a halide derivative of the formula (38). Aryl halide of the formula (38) can be transformed into allyl thiophene of the formula (39) by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (11) in the presence of Pd(O) catalyst. Allyl thiophene of the formula (39) can be converted into thieno[3,4-(/]pyrimidinylacetic acid of the formula (40) by oxidative cleavage of the terminal double bond as described in Scheme 1. The coupling of compounds of formula (40) with amines of the general formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ib'). \n\n Scheme 6\n\n\nMoφholine/ S\n8\n Ethanol\n\n\noxidation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(40) (Ib')\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of compounds of formula (Ic) or (Id) wherein R\na\n is hydrogen or alkyl, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above is prepared as shown is Scheme 7. The coupling of compounds of formula (25) with respective amines of formula (46) by using a standard amide coupling method will give compounds of general formula (Ic).\n\n\nSimilarly the coupling of compounds of formula (40) with respective amines of formula (46) by using a standard amide coupling method will give compounds of general formula (Id).\n\n\nScheme-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 8 depicts synthesis of 2-amino-4-aryl thiazoles of the formula (46) (wherein R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above) which is prepared from \n\n acetophenones of the formula (45) using known approaches. Certain di-and tri-substituted acetophenones were not commercially available and they were prepared from the corresponding benzoic acid derivative of formula (41) in three steps. Thus, acid of formula (41) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (42) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. The acid chloride of formula (42) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula\n\n\n(44) by treating with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride of formula (43) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of alkyl magnesium iodide to Weinreb amide of formula (44) afforded acetophenone derivative of formula (45).\n\n\nConversion of acetophenone derivative of formula (45) to 2-amino-4-substituted aryl thiazole of the formula (46) can be effected by two approaches as described in Scheme 8. In the first case acetophenone was converted to the corresponding phenacyl bromide, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. Alternatively, acetophenone derivative of formula\n\n\n(45) can be converted to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole (46) in one step by its reaction with thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanol (Carroll, K. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1950, 3722 and Νaik, S. I; Halkar, U.

Thus, reaction of acetophenone derivative of formula (45) with bromine in acetic acid gives phenacyl bromide, which on reaction with acetyl guanidine in acetonitrile at reflux temperature gives N-acetyl imidazole of the formula (47). The N-deacetylation of (47) under acidic conditions affords 2-amino-4-arylimidazoles of the formula (48). This is similar to the procedure reported by Thomas, L. et al in J. Org.

The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art.\n\n\nScreening for TRPAl antagonist using the \n45\nCalcium uptake assay:\n\n\nThe inhibition of TRPAl receptor activation was measured as inhibition of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium.\n\n\nTest compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n to get the desired concentration. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of G-418. Rat TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 μM (for human TRPAl) and / or 10 μM (for rat TRPAl) and 5 μCi/ml \n45\nCa\n+2\n for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant.

IC50 values can be calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.\n\n\nThe compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 2 and 3 for human and rat respectively. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 μM and 10.0 μM are given in the tables along with IC50 \n\n (nM) details for selected examples.

Description\n\n\n\n\n ISOTHIAZOLO-PYRIMIDINEDIONE DERIVATIVES AS TRPA1\n\n\nMODULATORS\n\n\nRelated applications\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of Indian Patent Application No 665/MUM/2009 filed on March 23, 2009 and US Provisional Application No 61/171,355 filed on April 21, 2009 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nThe present patent application relates to isothiazolo[3,41-] pyrimidinedione and isothiazolo[5,4-d] pyrimidinedione derivatives with transient receptor potential ankyrinl (TRPAl) activity.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nThe transient receptor potential (TRP) channels or receptors are pain receptors. They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTMl) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPCl (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPVl, TRPV2, TRPV3 or TRP V4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRP V3 and is more closely related to TRPVl and TRPV2 than to TRP V5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPMl (melastatin or LTRPCl), TRPM3 (KIAAl 616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMRl), TRPM5 (MTRl or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPMLl (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPPl (PKDl, PCl), PKD-REJ and PKD-ILl are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTMl. \n\n It is believed TRPAl is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPAl is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice.TRPAl is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson LJ et al, Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAl ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAl receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAl is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals\n\n\nThe difference between TRPAl and other TRP receptors is that TRPAl ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged.

The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPAl is illustrated, for example, in Story, G. M. et al. Cell, 2003, 112, 819-829; McMahon, S.B. and Wood, J. N., Cell, 2006, 124, 1123-1125; Voorhoeve, P. M. et al. Cell, 2006, 124, 1169-1181; Wissenbach, U, Niemeyer, B. A. and Flockerzi, V. Biology of the Cell, 2004, 96, 47-54; and the references cited therein.\n\n\nPain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett & F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed., 1996, 100-107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as \"nociceptors\". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and Aδ fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, \n\n thermal and proton (pH<6) modalities. Nociceptors are the nerves which sense and respond to parts of the body which suffer from damage. They signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain.\n\n\nChronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited).\n\n\nGeneral Methods of Preparation\n\n\nThe compounds described herein, including compounds of general formula (I), (Ia), (Ib) and (Ic) and specific examples, can be prepared by techniques known to one in the art, for example, through the reaction scheme depicted in Schemes 1-10. Furthermore, in the following scheme, where specific acids, bases, reagents, coupling agents, solvents etc. are mentioned, it is understood that other suitable acids, bases, reagents, coupling agents etc. may be used and are included within the scope of the present invention. Modifications to reaction conditions, for example, temperature, duration of the reaction or combinations thereof are envisioned as part of the present invention. The compounds obtained by using the general reaction scheme may be of insufficient purity. These compounds can be purified by any of the methods for purification of organic compounds known in the art, for example, crystallization or silica gel or alumina column chromatography using different solvents in suitable ratios. All possible stereo isomers are envisioned within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of isothiazolo pyrimidinyl acetamides of the general formula (I), wherein Y, Z, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, U, V and L are as defined above in the general description can be prepared as described in Scheme 1. Coupling reaction of a carboxylic acid of the formula (1) with amines of the general formula (2) in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) using a suitable base and solvent gives compounds of the formula \n\n (3). The selective N-alkylation of the compounds of the formula (3) with suitable alkylating agent of the formula (4) in the presence of base and solvent gives compounds of the general formula (I).\n\n\nScheme 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn approach for the synthesis of isothiazolo[3,4-<i]pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ia), wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, U and V are as defined above is prepared as depicted in Scheme 2. 6-Amino-1,3-dialkyl uracil-5-carbodithioate (6) is obtained by the reaction of 6-amino-l,3-dialkyl uracil (5) with carbon disulphide and dimethyl sulfate in the presence of suitable base as reported by Kobayashi G. et al. Yakugaku Zasshi, 1979, 515-520. Oxidative cyclisation of compounds of the formula (6) using iodine in the presence of suitable solvent gives 3-methylsulfanylisothiazolo[3,4-(/]pyrimidinedione (7) according to the procedure described by Kobayashi G. et al. Yakugaku Zasshi, 1979, 989-992 and Kobayashi, G. et. al. Heterocycles, 1979, 485-488. The oxidation of methylsulfanyl isothiazole (7) using oxone in the presence of a suitable solvent furnished the expected sulphone derivative (8) in good yield. Reaction of sulphone (8) with dialkyl malonoate (9) in the presence of suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent gives the diester of the formula (10) (wherein R is alkyl). Dealkoxycarbonylation of diester (10) using suitable base such as sodium hydride afforded desired isothiazolo[3,4-<i]pyrimidinyl ester (11). Hydrolysis of the ester (11) with aqueous acid gives compounds of the formula (12). The carboxylic acid of formula (12) is coupled with an amine of the general formula (2) in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as EDCI to give compounds represented by the general formula (Ia). \n\n Scheme 2 ) alkoxycarbonylation\n\n\nvent \n\n\n (Ia)\n\n\nAnother approach for the synthesis of isothiazolo[3,4-βT|pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ia) is as shown in Scheme 3. Displacement of methylsulfonyl group of intermediate (8) with an active ester of the formula (13) (wherein R is alkyl) in the presence of a suitable base gives compounds of the formula (14). Dealkoxycarbonylation of (14) in the presence of suitable base and solvent gives the compounds of the general formula (Ia).\n\n\nScheme 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach for the synthesis isothiazolo[3,4-βT|pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ia) is as described in Scheme 4. Compounds of the formula (15) can be prepared from commercially available 6-aminouracil of the formula (5) in two steps according to reported procedure (Hirota, K. et al. Tetrahedron, 1996, 52, 9971- 9978). Cyclisation of compounds of the formula (15) using lead tetraacetate in suitable solvent gives fused isothiazole derivative of the formula (16), which on halogenation using N-bromosuccinimide or N-iodosuccinimide in BF\n3\n-etherate or trifluromethanesulphonic acid gives compounds of the formula (17). This conversion is \n\n according to procedure reported by George, O. L. et al. J. Am. Chem., 2004, 126, 15770- 15776. The halide (17) can be transformed to the corresponding allyl isothiazole derivative of the formula (19) by a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with allyl boronic acids of formula (18) in the presence of Pd (0) using a procedure similar to the Suzuki- Miyaura coupling reaction described by Kotha et al. Synlett 2005, 12, 1877-1890. Compound of the formula (19) is transformed to the carboxylic acid (12) using oxidative cleavage of the terminal olefin by methods well known in the literature. The coupling of compounds of formula (11) with an amine of the general formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ia).\n\n\nScheme 4\n\n\n \n\n (17) ( ) (12) (Ia)\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of isothiazolo[5,4-t/]pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ib) wherein, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, U and V are as defined above is shown in Scheme 5. The known 6-chloro-l,3-dimethyluracil (20) is prepared according to the reported procedure from commercially available 1,3-dialkylbarbituric acid. The reaction of 6- chloro-1,3-dialkyluracil (20) with sodium hydrosulphide hydrate in the presence of a suitable solvent gives 6-mercapto-l,3-dialkyluracil of the formula (21) (this is similar to procedure reported by Itoh, T. et al. Chem. Pharma. Bull. 1981, 29 (4), 1039-1043). The cyclisation of 6-mercapto-1,3-dialkyluracil (21) with malonic acid in the presence of acetic anhydride and acetic acid gives 5-hydroxythiopyrano[2,3-<i]pyrimidinetrione (22). The Posner reaction of compounds of the formula (22) using hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of suitable base such as triethylamine or sodium alkoxide in a suitable solvent gives the expected isothiazolo[5,4-<i]pyrimidinyl acetic acid (23). (This is according to procedure reported by Posner, T. et al. Chem. Ber., 1913, 46, 3816 and Giannella, M. et al. Phytochemistry 1971, 10, 539 - 544). The coupling reaction of compounds of formula (23) with respective amines of the general formula (2) by using a \n\n standard amide coupling methods gives compounds of general formula (Ib). Alterantively, isothiazolo[5,4-<i]pyrimidinyl acetic acid (23) can also be converted to the corresponding ester (24) by using well known esterification methods. Sodium hydride mediated coupling reaction of (24) with various amines of the general formula (2) gives amides of the general formula (Ib).\n\n\nScheme 5\n\n\nOb) \n\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach for the synthesis of isothiazolo[5,4-βT|pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (Ib) is as shown in Scheme 6. Synthesis starts from readily available barbituric acid of the formula (25). The known 6-chloro-5-formyluracil of the formula\n\n\n(26) is prepared according to the reported procedure (Singh, J. S. et al, Synthesis 1988, 342-344). The reaction of 6-chloro-5-formyl-1,3-dialkyluracil (26) with hydroxylamine in methanol followed by dehydration with phosphorous oxy chloride gives 6-chloro-5-cyano- 1,3-dialkyluracil of the formula (27). ό-Chloro-S-cyano-l^-dialkyluracil of the formula\n\n\n(27) can be converted to 6-mercapto-5-cyanouracil derivative (28) by its reaction with sodium hydrosulphide hydrate. The cyclisation of 6-mercapto-5-cyano deriavative (28) using chloramines in the presence of suitable solvent gives aminoisothiazole (29). The aminoisothiazole (29) on diazotization followed by halide substitution with copper halide (such as copper bromide or copper iodide) gives a halide derivative of the formula (30). The halide (30) can be transformed into allyl isothiazole of the formula (31) by Suzuki- Miyaura coupling reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (18) as described in Scheme 4. Allyl isothiazole of the formula (31) can be converted to isothiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidinylacetic acid of the formula (23) by oxidative cleavage of the \n\n terminal double bond using an appropriate oxidizing agent in a suitable solvent. The coupling of compounds of formula (23) with an amine of the general formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ib).\n\n\nScheme 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral approach for the synthesis of compound of foumula (Ic) (wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above) is depicted in scheme 7. Direct coupling of compounds of the general formula (11) with appropriate amines of formula (37) by using suitable base (e.g., sodium hydride) and in suitable solvent (e.g. toluene, xylene) gives compounds of the general formula (Ic). Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (Ic) can be prepared in two steps by hydrolysis of (11) under acidic conditions to give the carboxylic acid (12) followed by coupling with amine of the general formula (37) using a suitable coupling agents [e.g., N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP]) in suitable solvent or mixture of solvents to give compounds of the general formula (Ic). \n\n Scheme 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral approach for the synthesis of compound of foumula (Id) (wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above) is depicted in scheme 8. Direct coupling of compounds of the general formula (23) with appropriate amines of formula (37) by using suitable coupling agents [e.g., N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), benzotriazol- 1 -yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP]) in suitable solvent or mixture of solvents gives compounds of the general formula (Id). Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (Id) can also be prepared in two steps by esterification of (23) to give the corresponding ester of the formula (24) followed by its coupling with amine of the general formula (37) using a suitable base (e.g., sodium hydride) and in suitable solvent (e.g. toluene, xylene) to gives compounds of the general formula (Id).\n\n\nScheme 8\n\n\n \n\n Scheme 9 depicts synthesis of 2-amino-4-aryl thiazoles of the formula (37) (wherein R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above in description) which is prepared from acetophenones of the formula (36) using known approaches. Certain di-and tri- substituted acetophenones were not commercially available and they were prepared from the corresponding benzoic acid derivative of formula (32) in three steps. Thus, acid of formula (32) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (33) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. The acid chloride of formula (33) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula\n\n\n(35) by treating with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride of formula (34) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of methyl magnesium iodide to Weinreb amide of formula (35) afforded acetophenone derivative of formula (36).\n\n\nConversion of acetophenone derivative of formula (36) to 2-amino-4-substituted aryl thiazole of the formula (37) can be effected by two approaches as described in Scheme 9. In the first case acetophenone was converted to the corresponding phenacyl bromide, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. Alternatively, acetophenone derivative of formula\n\n\n(36) can be converted to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole (37) in one step by its reaction with thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanol (Carroll, K. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1950, 3722 and Νaik, S. J.; Halkar, U. P., ARKIVOC, 2005, xiii, 141-149).\n\n\nScheme 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3-Amino-1-arylpyrazole was prepared as shown in Scheme 10. Reaction of phenylhydrazine derivative of formula (38) (wherein R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and R\n8\n are as defined \n\n above in description) with acrylonitrile in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium ethoxide or sodium methoxide in refluxing ethanol affords the dihydro derivative of compound of formula (39). Intermediate (39) on oxidation with N-bromosuccinimide as reported by Duffin, G. F. et al, J. Chem. Soc, 1954, 408-415, gives 3 -amino- 1- arylpyrazoles derivative of formula (40).\n\n\nScheme 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intermediates and examples described in the present invention are prepared using the procedure described below. However, it is understood that these intermediates and examples can be prepared by alternate approaches which are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\nUnless otherwise stated, work-up includes distribution of the reaction mixture between the organic and aqueous phase indicated within parentheses, separation of layers and drying the organic layer over sodium sulphate, filtration and evaporation of the solvent.

The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art.\n\n\nScreening for TRPAl antagonist using the \n45\nCalcium uptake assay:\n\n\nThe inhibition of TRPAl receptor activation was measured as inhibition of ally 1 isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium.\n\n\nTest compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n to get the desired concentration. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of G-418. Rat TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 μM (for human TRPAl) and / or 10 μM (for rat TRPAl) and 5 μCi/ml \n45\nCa\n+2\n for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was \n\n measured in a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant.

IC50 values can be calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.\n\n\nThe compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 4. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 μM and 10.0 μM are given in the table along with IC50 (nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 4 wherein wherein \"A\" refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM, \"B\" refers to IC50 value in range of 50.01 to 100.0 nM and \"C\" refers to an IC\n50\n values above 100.0 nM.\n\n\nTable 4: In-vitro screening results of compounds of invention"
