Alternatively, the reaction can proceed in the presence of a suitable catalyst (for example, palladium di-benzyl-acetone), in the presence of a base (for example, caesium carbonate) and in the presence of a suitable reaction facilitator (for example, xanthphos).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy or amino, are or need to be protected in a compound of formula II or III, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as substitution reaction or solvolysis. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts can usually be converted to compounds in free form, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals can include for example the solvent used for crystallization (present as solvates).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula II used as starting materials may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula IV\n\n \n \n\nwith a compound of formula V\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n and R\n6\n are as defined above, and Y\n1\n and Y\n2\n are Identical or different leaving groups as defined above for Y. The reaction conditions are those mentioned above for the reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of formula III.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula IV and V are known or may be produced in accordance with known procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro In cell-free kinase assays and in cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase, and are useful as pharmaceuticals to treat conditions caused by a malfunction of signal cascades connected with Focal Adhesion Kinase, In particular tumors as described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFocal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a key enzyme In the integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascade (\nD. Schlaepfer et al., Prog Blophys Mol Biol 1999, 71, 435-478\n). Interaction between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is transduced as intracellular signals important for growth, survival and migration through cell surface receptors, integrins. FAK plays an essential role In these integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascades. The trigger in the signal transduction cascade is the autophosphorylation of Y397. Phosphorylated Y397 is a SH2 docking site for Src family tyrosine kinases. The bound c-Src kinase phosphorylates other tyrosine residues In FAK. Among them, phsophorylated Y925 becomes a binding site for the SH2 site of Grb2 small adaptor protein. This direct binding of Grb2 to FAK is one of the key steps for the activation of down stream targets such as the Ras-ERK2/MAP kinase cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of endogenous FAK signalling results in reduced motility and in some cases induces cell death. On the other hand, enhancing FAK signalling by exogenous expression increases cell motility and transmitting a cell survival signal from ECM. In addition FAK is overexpressed in invasive and metastatic epithelial, mesenchymal, thyroid and prostate cancers. Consequently, an inhibitor of FAK is likely to be a drug for anti-tumor growth and metastasis. The compounds of the invention are thus indicated, for example, to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by a neoplastic disease, in particular breast tumor, cancer of the bowel (colon and rectum), stomach cancer and cancer of the ovary and prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of liver, melanoma, bladder tumor and cancer of head and neck.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relation between FAK inhibition and immuno-system is described e.g. in \nG.A. van Seventer et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 2001, 31, 1417-1427\n. Therefore, the compounds of the invention are, for example, useful to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by immune system disorders, diseases or disorders mediated by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, mast cells and/or eosinophils e.g. acute or chronic rejection of organ or tissue allo- or xenografts, atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion due to vascular injury such as angioplasty, restenosis, hypertension, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CNS disease such as Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, infectious disease such as AIDS, septic shock or adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia/reperfusion injury e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, or traumatic shock. The agent of the invention are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes (type I and II) and the disorders associated with therewith, respiratory diseases such as asthma or inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders or illnesses, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis), inflammatory eye diseases, e.g. Sjoegren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis or uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are active in a FAK assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC\n50\n In the range of 1 nM to 100 nM. Particularly active are the compounds Example No. 3-12 and No. 3-17 described hereinbelow showing IC\n50\n vales in the range of 1 to 5 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention exhibit also ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein of 70 kD) protein tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity. ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase Interaction of the agents of the Invention may be demonstrated by their ability to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. LAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell) by human ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase In aqueous solution, as described in the Examples. The compounds of the invention are thus also indicated for the prevention or treatment of disorders or diseases where ZAP-70 inhibition inhibition play a role.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are active In a ZAP-70 assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC\n50\n in the range of 1 µM to 10µM, as do the compounds Example No. 2 and No. 3-2 described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention are also good inhibitors of the IGF-IR (Insulin like growth factor receptor 1) and are therefore useful in the treatment of IGF-1 R mediated diseases for example such diseases include proliferative diseases, such as tumours, like for example breast, renal, prostate, colorectal, thyroid, ovarian, pancreas, neuronal, lung, uterine and gastro-intestinal tumours as well as osteosarcomas and melanomas. The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using a cellular \"Capture ELISA\". In this assay the activity of the compounds of the invention against Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induced autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR is determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I'and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro In cell-free kinase assays and In cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), and are useful as pharmaceuticals to treat conditions caused by a malfunction of signal cascades connected with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, in particular tumors as described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nALK-mediated signaling could play a role in the development and/or progression of a number of common solid tumors (\nPulford, K., et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 2004 Jun;199(3):330-58\n). The compounds of the present invention also exhibit powerful inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its fusion proteins, particularly the fusion protein of NPM-ALK . This protein tyrosine kinase results from a gene fusion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), rendering the protein tyrosine kinase activity of ALK ligand-independent. NPM-ALK plays a key role in signal transmission in a number of hematopoetic and other human cells leading to hematological and neoplastic diseases, for example in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), specifically in ALK+ NHL or Alkomas, in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and neuroblastomas. (\nDuyster J et al. 2001 Oncogene 20, 5623-5637\n). NPM-ALK has been shown to be a potent oncogene in vitro, being able to transform various cell lines and primary hematopoetic cells. Furthermore, NPM-ALK transduced bone marrow cells are able to induce a lymphoma-like disease after transplantation into irradiated recipient mice. Signaling pathways activated by NPM-ALK include ras, PLC and PI3K pathways and, in addition, STAT5 has been shown to be phosphorylated by NPM-ALK. in addition to NPM-ALK, other gene fusions have been identified in human hematological and neoplastic diseases; mainly TPM3-ALK (a fusion of nonmuscle tropomyosin 3 with ALK). Further, the ALK fusion protein CLTC-ALK, is associated with diseases that include classical T cell or null ALCL, ALK\n+\n DLBCL and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. CLTCL-ALK is also thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of large B-cell lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the ALK fusion protein CLTC-ALK is associated with diseases that include classical T cell or null ALCL, ALK\n+\n DLBCL and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. CLTCL-ALK is also thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of large B-cell lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAberrant activity of ALK is involved in the development of brain tumors and overexpression of ALK has been reported in neuroblastomas and several cell lines derived from neural tissue. ALK-mediated signaling could play a role in the development and/or progression of a number of common solid tumors (\nPulford, K., et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 2004 Jun;199(3):330-58\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using known methods, for example using the recombinant kinase domain of the ALK in analogy to the VEGF-R kinase assay described in J. Wood et al. Cancer Res. \n60\n, 2178-2189 (2000). In vitro enzyme assays using GST-ALK protein tyrosine kinase are performed in 96-well plates as a filter binding assay in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH = 7.5, 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MnCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 µCl/assay (=30 µl) [γ-\n33\nP]-ATP, 2 µM ATP, 3 µg/ml poly (Glu, Tyr 4:1) Poly-EY (Sigma P-0275), 1 % DMSO, 25 ng ALK enzyme. Assays are Incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. Reactions are terminated by adding 50 µl of 125 mM EDTA, and the reaction mixture is transferred onto a MAIP Multlscreen plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), previously wet with methanol, and rehydrated for 5 min with H\n2\nO. Following washing (0.5 % H\n3\nPO\n4\n), plates are counted in a liquid scintillation counter. IC\n50\n values are calculated by linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition. Compared with the control without inhibitor, the compounds of formula I inhibit the enzyme activity by 50 % (IC\n50\n), for example in a concentration of from 0.001 to 0.5 µM, especially from 0.01 to 0.1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I'potently inhibit the growth of human NPM-ALK overexpressing murine BaF3 cells (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zolikulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The expression of NPM-ALK is achieved by transfecting the BaF3 cell line with an expression vector pCIneo™ (Promega Corp., Madison WI, USA) coding for NPM-ALK and subsequent selection of G418 resistant cells. Non-transfected BaF3 cells depend on IL-3 for cell survival. In contrast NPM-ALK expressing BaF3 cells (named BaF3-NPM-ALK hereinafter) can proliferate in the absence of IL-3 because they obtain proliferative signal through NPM-ALK kinase. Putative inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase therefore abolish the growth signal and result In antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity of putative inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase can however be overcome by addition of IL-3 which provides growth signals through an NPM-ALK independent mechanism. [For an analogous cell system using FLT3 kinase see \nE Weisberg et al. Cancer Cell; 1, 433-443 (2002\n)]. The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula I is determined, briefly, as follows: BaF3-NPM-ALK cells (15,000/microtitre plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtitre plates. The test compounds [dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] are added In a series of concentrations (dilution series) in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1 % (v/v). After the addition, the plates are incubated for two days during which the control cultures without test compound are able to undergo two cell-division cycles. The growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells is measured by means of Yopro™ staining [T Idziorek et al. J. Immunol. Methods; \n185\n: 249-258 (1995)]: 25 µl of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0, 26.8 mM sodium chloride, 0.4 % NP40, 20 mM EDTA and 20 mM is added to each well. Cell lysis is completed within 60 min at room temperature and total amount of Yopro bound to DNA is determined by measurement using the Cytofluor II 98-well reader (PerSeptive Blosystems) with the following settings: Excitation (nm) 485/20 and Emission (nm) 530/25.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50\n values are determined by a computer-aided system using the formula: \n \n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \nABS\n \ntest\n \n \n-\n \n \nABS\n \nstart\n \n \n \n/\n \n \n \nABS\n \ncontrol\n \n \n-\n \n \nABS\n \nstart\n \n \n \n \n \n \nx\n \n \n \n100.\n \n \nABS\n \n=\n \nabsorption\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC\n50\n value In those experiments is given as that concentration of the test compound in question that results in a cell count that is 50 % lower than that obtained using the control without inhibitor. The compounds of formula l'exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC\n50\n in the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antiproliferative action of the compounds of formula I' can also be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) [described in \nWG Dirks et al. Int. J. Cancer 100, 49-56 (2002\n)] using the same methodology described above for the BaF3-NPM-ALK cell line, The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC\n50\n In the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe action of the compounds of formula I' on autophosphorylation of the ALK can be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line by means of an immunoblot as described In \nWG Dirks et al. Int J. Cancer 100, 49-56 (2002\n). In that test the compounds of formula I exhibit an IC\n50\n of approximately from 0.001 to 1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds of formula I, 2-[5-chloro-2-(2-methoxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-ylamino]-N-methyl-benzamide is an especially potent ALK inhibitor, In that this compound inhibits the growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells with an IC\n50\n of 97 nM. Further specifically preferred compounds that Inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the compounds described hereinafter in the examples 7A and 7B, as well as 7-2, 7-15, 19-5, 21-1, 26-3 and 28-5, respectively, all of which are having an IC\n50\n within the range from <0.5 to 200 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the above uses in the treatment of neoplastic diseases and immune system disorders the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 2000 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent may be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms for oral administration contain, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active substance. Topical administration is e.g. to the skin. A further form of topical administration is to the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreference is given to the use of solutions of the active ingredient, and also suspensions or dispersions, especially isotonic aqueous solutions, dispersions or suspensions which, for example in the case of lyophilized compositions comprising the active ingredient alone or together with a carrier, for example mannitol, can be made up before use. The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilized and/or may comprise excipients, for example preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilizers, salts for regulating osmotic pressure and/or buffers and are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional dissolving and lyophilizing processes. The said solutions or suspensions may comprise viscosity-increasing agents, typically sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or gelatins, or also solubilizers, e.g. Tween 80\n®\n (polyoxyethylene(20)sorbitan mono-oleate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions in oil comprise as the oil component the vegetable, synthetic, or semi-synthetic oils customary for injection purposes. In respect of such, special mention may be made of liquid fatty acid esters that contain as the acid component a long-chained fatty acid having from 8 to 22, especially from 12 to 22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, brassidic acid or linoleic acid, if desired with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, β-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. The alcohol component of these fatty acid esters has a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and is a monovalent or polyvalent, for example a mono-, di- or trivalent, alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or pentanol or the isomers thereof, but especially glycol and glycerol. As fatty acid esters, therefore, the following are mentioned: ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, \"Labrafil M 2375\" (polyoxyethylene glycerol), \"Labrafil M 1944 CS\" (unsaturated polyglycolized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of apricot kernel oil and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester), \"Labrasol\" (saturated polyglycolized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of TCM and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester; all available from Gattefossé, France), and/or \"Miglyol 812\" (triglyceride of saturated fatty acids of chain length C\n8\n to C\n12\n from Hüls AG, Germany), but especially vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and more especially groundnut oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe manufacture of injectable preparations is usually carried out under sterile conditions, as is the filling, for example, into ampoules or vials, and the sealing of the containers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained, for example, by combining the active ingredient with one or more solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, by the inclusion of additional excipients, to form tablets or tablet cores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations, and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and also binders, such as starches, for example corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Additional excipients are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol, or derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablet cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings through the use of, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes or pigments may be added to the tablets or tablet coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration also include hard capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft, sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as corn starch, binders, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquid excipients, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols or fatty acid esters of ethylene or propylene glycol, to which stabilizers and detergents, for example of the polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester type, may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient and a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example of a water-soluble salt, or aqueous injection suspensions that contain viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, if desired, stabilizers, are especially suitable. The active ingredient, optionally together with excipients, can also be in the form of a lyophilizate and can be made into a solution before parenteral administration by the addition of suitable solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions such as are used, for example, for parenteral administration can also be employed as infusion solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred preservatives are, for example, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, or microbicides, such as sorbic acid or benzoic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered as the sole active ingredient or together with other drugs useful against neoplastic diseases or useful in Immunomodulating regimens. For example, the agents of the invention may be used in accordance with the invention in combination with pharmaceutical compositions effective in various diseases as described above, e.g. with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, fludarabine, gamcitabine, cisplatinum, carboplatin, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide, irinotecan, paclitaxel, docetaxel, rituxan, doxorubicine, gefitinib, or

Then, the selective Lck inhibitor PP2 (1-tert-butyl-3-(4-chloro-phenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine; Alexis Biochemicals) is added (final concentration 1.2 µM) and incubated for further 10 min. 10 µL of this solution is mixed with the 10 µL biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (1 µM) as substrate and 20 µL of serial dilutions of inhibitors and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The kinase reaction is terminated with 10 µL of a 10 mM EDTA solution in detection buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween-20). 50 µL europium-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu-PT66; final concentration 0.125 nM); and 50 µL streptavidin-allophycocyanine (SA-APC; final concentration 40 nM) in detection buffer are added. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature fluorescence is measured on the Victor2 Multilabel Counter (Wallac) at 665 nm. Background values (low control) are obtained in the absence of test samples and ATP and are subtracted from all values. Signals obtained in the absence of test samples are taken as 100% (high control). The inhibition obtained in the presence of test compounds is calculated as percent inhibition of the high control. The concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% inhibition (IC\n50\n) is determined from the dose-response curves. In this assay, the agents of the invention have IC\n50\n values in the range of 10 nM to 2 µM, preferably from 10 nM to 100 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant ZAP-70 kinase is obtained as follows: A nucleic acid encoding full-length human ZAP-70 (GenBank #L05148) is amplified from a Jurkat cDNA library by RT-PCR and cloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, California, USA). The authenticity of the ZAP-70 cDNA insert is validated by complete sequence analysis. This donor plasmid is then used to construct a recombinant baculovirus transfer vector based on the plasmid pVL1392 (Pharmingen, California, USA) featuring in addition an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Following co-transfection with AcNPV viral DNA, 10 independent viral isolates are derived via plaque-purification, amplified on small scale and subsequently analyzed for recombinant ZAP-70 expression by Western Blot using a commercially available anti-ZAP-70 antibody (Clone 2F3.1, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). Upon further amplification of one positive recombinant plaque, titrated virus stocks are prepared and used for infection of Sf9 cells grown in serum-free SF900 II medium (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) under defined, optimized conditions. ZAP-70 protein is isolated from the lysate of infected Sf9 cells by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTAcolumn (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant His-tagged ZAP-70 is also available from PanVera LLC, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell): The biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (Biotin-EEGAPDYENLQELN) used as a substrate in the ZAP-70 kinase assay is prepared in analogy to known methods of peptide synthesis. The N-a Fmoc group of Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-oxymethyl-4-phenoxymethyl-co(polystyrene-1%-divinyl-benzene), content of Asn approx. 0.5 mmol/g, is cleaved using piperidine, 20% in DMF. Four equivalents per amino-group of Fmoc-amino acid protected in their side chains [Asp(OtBu), Glu(OtBu), Asn(Trt), Gln(Trt) and Tyr(tBu)] are coupled using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF. After complete assembly of the peptide chain the terminal Fmoc-protecting group is removed with piperidine in DMF as before. L(+)-biotinyl-aminohexanoic acid is then coupled to the terminal amino group using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF using four equivalents of the reagents for four days at RT. The peptide is cleaved from the resin support and all side-chain protecting groups are simultaneously removed by using a reagent consisting of 5% dodecylmethylsulfide and 5% water in TFA for two hours at RT. Resin particles are filtered off, washed with TFA and the product is precipitated from the combined filtrates by the addition of 10 to 20 volumes of diethyl ether, washed with ether and dried. The product is purified by chromatography on a C-18 wide-pore silica column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 2% aqueous phosphoric acid. Fractions containing the pure compound are collected, filtered through an anion-exchange resin (Biorad, AG4-X4 acetate form) and lyophilized to give the title compound.

Cells are cultured for 2 h and inhibitors are added at various concentrations in a final concentration of 0.1 % DMSO. After 48 h, cell growth is assayed with the cell counting kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemical), which uses a water soluble tetrazolium salt WST8. Twenty µL of the reagent is added into each well and cells are further cultured for 2 h. The optical density is measured at 450 nm. The concentration of compound causing 50 % inhibition of growth is determined.\n\n\n \nExample 59 \nIn vivo\n activity in the nude mouse xenograft model:\n\n\n \n \n \nfemale or male BALB/c nude mice (5-8 weeks old, Charles River Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) are kept under sterile conditions with water and feed \nad libitum.\n Tumours are induced by subcutaneous injection of tumour cells (human epithelial cell line MIA PaCa-2; European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK, Catalogue Number 85062806; cell line from a 65 year old Caucasian male; undifferentiated human pancreatic carcinoma cell line) into left or right flank of mice under Forene\n®\n anaesthesia (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Treatment with the test compound is started when the mean tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm\n3\n. Tumour growth is measured two times per week and 1 day after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpendicular axis. The tumour volumes are calculated in accordance with published methods (see \nEvans et al., Brit. J. Cancer 45, 466-8, 1982\n). The anti-tumour efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumour volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tumour volume of the untreated animals (controls) and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as delta T/C [%]. Tumour regression is reported as the mean changes of tumor volume of the treated animals divided by the mean tumor volume at start of treatment and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as regression [%]. The test compound is orally administered daily with or without drug holidays. As an alternative to cell line MIA PaCa-2, another cell line may also be used in the same manner, for example:\n\n \n \n \nthe 4T1 breast carcinoma cell line (ATCC Number CRL-2539; see also \nCancer. 88(12 Supple), 2979-2988, 2000\n) with female BALB/c mice (injection into mammary fat pad).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nOn the basis of these studies, a compound of formula I according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against proliferative diseases responsive to an inhibition of a tyrosine kinase.\n\n\n \n \nExample 60\n: Tablets\n\n\n \n \n \nTablets comprising 50 mg of active ingredient, for example one of the compounds of formula I described in Examples 1 to 131, and having the following composition are prepared in customary manner\n\n\n \n\n\nComposition:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n50 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwheat starch\n\n\n150 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlactose\n\n\n125 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolloidal silicic acid\n\n\n12.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntalc\n\n\n22.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmagnesium stearate\n\n\n2.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal:\n\n\n362.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPreparation\n: The active ingredient is mixed with a portion of the wheat starch, with the lactose and the colloidal silicic acid and the mixture is forced through a sieve.

    "text": "Pyrrole derivative or salt thereof Abstract[Problem] To provide a compound which may be used for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases in which 5-HT 2B  receptor and 5-HT 7  receptor are concerned, particularly for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  [Means for Resolution] It was found that a pyrrole derivative  characterized by  the possession of a guanidinocarbonyl group or amido group as a substituent group at the 3-position, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, has a strong antagonism for both of the 5-HT 2B  receptor and 5-HT 7  receptor. In addition, the compound of the present invention having the antagonistic activity for both of the receptors showed a good pharmacological action in comparison with the case in which an antagonist selective for either one of the receptors was used alone.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, particularly a pyrrole derivative which is useful as a therapeutic agent for irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSerotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter and expresses various physiological actions via a 5-HT receptor. The 5-HT receptor is classified into seven families of from 5-HT\n1\n to 5-HT\n7\n. Particularly, the 5-HT\n2\n receptor is known to have three subtypes, 5-HT\n2A\n, 5-HT\n2B\n and 5-HT\n2C\n (Non-patent Reference 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disease in which an abdominal pain or an abdominal unpleasantness continues for a prolonged period of time. Based on its symptoms, IBS is classified into a diarrhea type, a constipation type and a mixed type of diarrhea and constipation. In each case, it has been pointed out that there is a causal relation between the morbid state and the amount of 5-HT in blood. For example, there is a reference which points out that increase of blood 5-HT concentration after meal occurs in diarrhea type IBS patients and this is deeply concerned in the morbid state (Non-patent Reference 2).\n\nCurrently, though it is at the clinical trial in Japan, a 5-HT receptor antagonist or a 5-HT receptor agonist has been used in Europe and America as a therapeutic agent for IBS. As a therapeutic agent for diarrhea type, alosetron (5-HT\n3\n receptor antagonist) is used in the clinical field, but side effects such as ischemic colitis, constipation and the like have been reported. In addition, as a therapeutic agent for constipation type, tegaserod (5-HT\n4\n receptor agonist) is used in the clinical field in Europe and America, but side effects have also been reported (Non-patent \nReference\n 3 and 4).\n\nIn recent years, pharmacological studies on other 5-HT receptor subtypes have also been carried out (Non-patent Reference 5). Regarding the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor and 5-HT\n7\n receptor, there are reports which pointed out roles of said receptors in digestive tracts. For example, there are reports stating that the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor localizes in human ileum longitudinal muscle and a 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonistic compound suppresses contraction by 5-HT (Non-patent Reference 6), and that the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor localizing in human colon is concerned in the 5-HT-induced contraction at the time of electric stimulation and a 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonistic compound suppresses it (Non-patent Reference 7).\n\nIn addition, there are reports stating that the 5-HT\n7\n receptor localizes in guinea pig small intestines (Non-patent Reference 8) and rat small intestines (Non-patent Reference 9) and is concerned in the peristalsis of guinea pig ileum (Non-patent Reference 10).\n\nAlso, in the \nPatent Reference\n 1 which was applied by the present applicant and laid open to public after priority date of the instant application, it is reported that a selective 5-HT\n2B\n and 5-HT\n7\n receptor dual antagonist is useful in treating IBS.

Thus, preferred as the compounds of the present invention are compounds whose binding affinity for 5-HT\n2B\n and 5-HT\n7\n receptors is selective in comparison with α\n1\n, M\n1\n and D\n2\n receptors, and more preferred are compounds whose binding affinity for 5-HT\n2B\n and 5-HT\n7\n receptors is selective in comparison with α\n1\n, M\n1\n, D\n2\n, 5-HT\n1A\n, 5-HT\n1B\n, 5-HT\n2A\n, 5-HT\n2C\n, 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n and 5-HT\n6\n receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are cases in which geometrical isomers and tautomers are present in the compound (I) of the present invention. For example, the following tautomers are present.

Examples of such a functional group include amino group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group and the like, and as their protecting groups, the protecting groups described for example in \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\" edited by T.W. Greene and P.G. Wuts, (USA), 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999\n, may be cited, which may be optionally selected and used in response to the reaction conditions., By such a method, a desired compound may be obtained by introducing said protecting group and carrying out the reaction, and then removing the protecting group as occasion demands or converting it into a desired group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following describes typical production methods of the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n(First production method)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(In the formulae, L\n1\n represents -OH or a leaving group such as -O-lower alkyl, halogen, -O-methanesulfonyl, -O-toluenesulfonyl or the like. The same shall apply hereinafter.)\n\nThe compound (I) of the present invention may be produced by subjecting the compound represented by (1) which is a carboxylic acid or a reactive derivative thereof and an amine derivative (2) to amidation reaction.\n\nWhen the starting compound (1) is used as a free carboxylic acid wherein L\n1\n is -OH, a method in which the compound (1) and amine derivative (2) are dehydration-condensed in the presence of a condensing agent is used. As the condensing agent in this case, it is desirable to use N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide (WSC), 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), phosphorus oxychloride, PS-Carbodiimide (Argonaut Technologies, Inc., USA) or the like, and further an additive agent as occasion demands (e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimide (HONSu), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or the like).\n\nThe reaction is carried out using the compound (1) and amine derivative (2) in equivalent amount or one of them in excess amount, and using a condensing agent in equivalent amount or excess amount based on the carboxylic acid. It may be carried out under cooling to heating, preferably at from -20°C to 60°C , in a reaction inert solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene or the like, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform or the like, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, dimethoxyethane (DME) or the like, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, water or the like, or a mixed liquid thereof.\n\nWhen the starting compound (1) is used as a compounds wherein L\n1\n is a leaving group, namely a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, an acid halide (acid chloride, acid bromide or the like), an acid anhydride (a mixed acid anhydride with phenyl carbonate, p-toluenesulfonic acid, isovaleric acid or the like or symmetric acid anhydride), an active ester (an ester which may be prepared using phenol which may be substituted with an electron withdrawing group such as nitro group, fluorine atom or the like, HOBt, HONSu or the like), a lower alkyl ester or the like may be used as the reactive derivative of carboxylic acid. Each of these reactive derivatives may be produced from the carboxylic acid using a reaction obvious to those skilled in the art.\n\nThe reaction may be carried out using the compound (1) and amine derivative (2) in equivalent amount or one of them in excess amount under cooling to heating, preferably at from -20°C to 60°C, in a reaction inert solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, water or the like, or a mixed liquid thereof. In this connection, when a lower alkyl ester is used as the reactive derivative, it is desirable to carry out the reaction under room temperature to heating. Depending on the kind of the reactive derivative, it is sometimes advantageous for smoothly carrying out the reaction to undergo the reaction in the presence of a base (organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine or the like, or inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate or the like).

Such a composition may further contain tonicity agents, antiseptics, moistening agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents and solubilizing agents. These are sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, formulation of bactericides or irradiation. In addition, these can also be used by producing a sterile solid composition and dissolving or suspending it in sterile water or a sterile solvent for injection prior to use.\n\nTransmucosal preparations (e.g., inhalations, transnasal preparations and the like) are used in a solid, liquid or semisolid form and may be produced in accordance with known methods. For example, an excipient such as lactose, starch or the like, as well as a pH adjusting agent, an antiseptic, a surfactant, a lubricant, a stabilizer, a thickener and the like, may be optionally added. An appropriate device for inhalation or blowing may be used for the administration. For example, using a known device or a sprayer (e.g., an inhalation device for measured administration, or the like), a compound may be administered alone or as a powder of a formulated mixture, or as a solution or suspension by a combination with a medicinally acceptable carrier. The dry powder inhaler or the like may be for single or multiple administration use, and a dry powder or a powder-containing capsule may be used Alternatively, it may be a form such as a pressurized aerosol spray or the like which uses chlorofluproalkane, hydrofluoroalkane or carbon dioxide or the like suitable gas.\n\n\n \n(Test methods)\n\n\n \n \n \nEffects of the compound (1) of the present invention were verified by the following pharmacological tests.\n\n\n \nTest method (1) 5-HT\n2B\n receptor binding test\n\n\n(i) Preparation of membrane sample\n\n\n \n \n \nCultured human 5-HT\n2B\n receptor expressing HEK293-EBNA cells were washed with a phosphate buffer (PBS)(-).

This test is an animal model in which it is known that a 5-HT\n3\n receptor antagonist as a diarrhea type IBS-treating agent shows its efficacy.\n\n\n \nTest method\n\n\n \n \n \nThe agent to be tested was administered to male Wistar rats (body weight 250 to 320 g, 10 animals for each group), and a restraint stress was loaded 30 minutes thereafter. A restraint cage (trade name: KN-468, 265 mm in width x 95 mm in length x 200 mm in height, Natsume Seisakusho, Tokyo) was used for the restraint stress loading, and the number of faces excreted during I hour after the stress loading was counted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFig. 1\n, the RS-127445 as a 5-HT\n2B\n-selective antagonistic compound did not show defecation-suppressing action even when a dose of 10 mg/kg was orally administered (p.o.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, as shown in \nFig. 2\n, the SB-269970 as a 5-HT\n7\n-selective antagonistic compound also did not show the defecation-suppressing action even at a dose of 10 mg/kg (p.o.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, as shown in \nFig. 3\n, it was revealed that a synergistic effect may be obtained when both of the compounds RS-127445 and SB-269970 are simultaneously administered. That is, as shown in \nFig. 1 and Fig. 2\n, each of the RS-127445 and SB-269970 alone did not show the action even at 10 mg/kg (p.o.), but when both compounds were simultaneously administered, it was revealed that they show a significant suppressive action starting from a dose of 1 mg/kg (p.o.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the above results, it is expected that when the compound of the present invention possesses the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonism together with the 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonism, it will show a superior IBS morbid state-improving effect in comparison with the selective receptor antagonists against one of the receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis effect was the same when a compound of the present invention having both of the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonism and 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonism was used.\n\nAs shown in \nFig. 4\n, when the Example compound 161 was administered, it showed a significant suppressing action starting from a dose of 1 mg/kg (p.o.).\n\nAs shown in \nFig. 5\n, when the Example compound 153 was administered, it showed a significant suppressing action starting from a dose of 1 mg/kg (p.o.).\n\nAs shown in \nFig. 6\n, when the Example compound 154 was administered, it showed a significant suppressing action starting from a dose of 1 mg/kg (p.o.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of the aforementioned each test, the 5-HT\n2B\n receptor antagonism and 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonism were confirmed, and based on this, the usefulness as a therapeutic agent for IBS and a preventive agent for migraine is evident.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following illustratively describes production methods of the compounds of the present invention with reference to the production examples of the compounds of the present invention, but the present invention is not restricted by these examples.
