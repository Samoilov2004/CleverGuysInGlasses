Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates generally to compounds which act as inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10 enzyme, compositions and therapeutic uses thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSchizophrenia is debilitating disorder affecting the psychic and motor functions of the brain. It is typically diagnosed in individuals in their early to mid-twenties and symptoms include hallucinations and delusions or at the other extreme, anhedonia or social withdrawal. Across the spectrum, the symptoms are indicative of cognitive impairment and functional disabilities. Notwithstanding improvements in antipsychotic treatments, current therapies, including typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine or olanzapine) antipsychotics, have been less than acceptable and result in an extremely high rate of noncomplicance or discontinuation of medication. Dissatisfaction with therapy is attributed to lack of efficacy or intolerable and unacceptable side affects. The side effects have been associated with significant metabolic, extrapyramidal, prolactic and cardiac adverse events. See, Lieberman et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n(2005) 353:1209-1223.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile multiple pathways are believed to be involved with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia leading to psychosis and cognition deficits, much attention has focused on the role of glutamate/NMDA dysfunction associated with cyclic guanosine monophasphate (cGMP) levels and the dopaminergic D2 receptor associated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). These ubiquitous second messengers are responsible for altering the function of many intracellular proteins. Cyclic AMP is thought to regulate the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which in turns phosphorylates and regulates many types of proteins including ion channels, enzymes and transcription factors. Similarly, cGMP is also responsible for downstream regulation of kinases and ion channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne pathway for affecting the levels of cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP and cGMP, is to alter or regulate the enzymes that degrade these enzymes, known as 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The PDE superfamily includes twenty one genes that encode for eleven families of PDEs. These families are further subdivided based on catalytic domain homology and substrate specificity and include the 1) cAMP specific, PDE4A-D, 7A and 7B, and 8A and 8B, 2) cGMP specific, PDE 5A, 6A-C, and 9A, and 3) those that are dual substrate, PDE 1A-C, 2A, 3A and 3B, 10A, and 11A. The homology between the families, ranging from 20% to 45% suggests that it may be possible to develop selective inhibitors for each of these subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of PDE10 was reported by three groups independently and was distinguished from other PDEs on the basis of its amino acid sequence, functional properties, and tissue distribution (Fujishige et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n(1999) 274:18438-18445; Loughney et al., \nGene \n(1999) 234: 109-117; Soderling et al., \nPNAS, USA \n(1999) 96: 7071-7076). The PDE10 subtype at present consists of a sole member, PDE10A, having alternative splice variants at both the N-terminus (three variants) and C-terminus (two variants), but that does not affect the GAF domain in the N-terminus or the catalytic site in C-terminus. The N-terminus splice variants, PDE10A1 and PDE10A2, differ in that the A2 variant has a PKA phosphorylation site that upon activation, i.e. PKA phosphorylation in response to elevated cAMP levels, results in intracellular changes to the localization of the enzyme. PDE10A is unique relative to other PDE families also having the conserved GAF domain in that its ligand is cAMP, while for the other GAF-domain PDEs the ligand is cGMP (Kehler et al., \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2007) 17(2): 147-158). PDE10A has limited but high expression in the brain and testes. The high expression in the brain and, in particular, the neurons of the striatum, unique to PDE10, suggests that inhibitors thereto may be well suited from treating neurological and psychiatric disorders and conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of PDE10 is believed to be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and a wide variety of conditions or disorders that would benefit from increasing levels of cAMP and/or cGMP within neurons, including a variety neurological, psychotic, anxiety and/or movement disorders. Accordingly, agents that inhibit PDE10 and especially PDE10A would be desirable as therapeutics for neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to alkoxy tetrahydro-pyridopyrimidine compounds which are useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of central nervous system disorders associated with phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10). The present invention also relates to the use of such compounds for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, psychosis or Huntington's disease, and those associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to compounds of the formula I:\n\n\n \n

It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of the present invention are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplifying the invention are the specific compounds disclosed in the Examples and herein. The subject compounds are useful in a method of treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with PDE10 dysfunction in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. The subject compounds are useful in a method of inhibiting PDE10 activity in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. The subject compounds are also useful for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in medicine. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with PDE10 dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with PDE10 dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treating” or “treatment of” a disease state includes: 1) preventing the disease state, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state; 2) inhibiting the disease state, i.e., arresting the development of the disease state or its clinical symptoms; 3) or relieving the disease state, i.e., causing temporary or permanent regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject treated in the present methods is generally a mammal, in particular, a human being, male or female, in whom therapy is desired. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the neurological and psychiatric disorders by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders or by prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with such disorders with an effective amount of the compound of the present invention. As used herein, the terms “treatment” and “treating” refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the neurological and psychiatric disorders described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disorder symptoms, as well as the prophylactic therapy to retard the progression or reduce the risk of the noted conditions, particularly in a patient who is predisposed to such disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants propose that inhibitors of PDE10 and, in particular inhibitors of PDE10A, will provide therapeutic benefit to those individuals suffering from psychiatric and cognitive disorders. The unique and exclusive distribution of PDE10A in the medium spiny projection neurons of the striatum, which form the principle site for cortical and dopaminergic input within basal ganglia, suggests that it may be possible and desirable to identify inhibitors of PDE10 to ameliorate or eliminate unwanted cellular signaling within this site. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, Applicants believe that inhibition of PDE10A in the striatum will result in increased cAMP/cGMP signaling and striatal output, which has the potential to restore behavioral inhibition that is impaired in cognitive disease such as schizophrenia. Regulation and integration of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs will enhance cognitive behavior, while suppressing or reducing unwanted behavior. Thus, in one embodiment, compounds of the invention provide a method for treating or ameliorating diseases or conditions in which striatal hypofunction is a prominent feature or ones in which basal ganglia dysfunction plays a role, such as, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, addiction and psychosis. Other conditions for which the inhibitors described herein may have a desirable and useful effect include those requiring a reduction in activity and reduced response to psychomotor stimulants or where it would be desirable to reduce conditional avoidance responses, which is often predictive of clinical antipsychotic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “‘selective PDE10 inhibitor” refers to an organic molecule that effectively inhibits an enzyme from the PDE10 family to a greater extent than enzymes from the PDE1-9 or PDE11 families. In one embodiment, a selective PDE10 inhibitor is an organic molecule having a Ki for inhibition of PDE10 that is less than or about one-tenth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE10 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-tenth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. Preferably, a selective PDE10 inhibitor is an organic molecule, having a Ki for inhibition of PDE10 that is less than or about one-hundredth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE10 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-hundredth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. A “selective PDE10 inhibitor” can be identified, for example, by comparing the ability of an organic molecule to inhibit PDE10 activity to its ability to inhibit PDE enzymes from the other PDE families. For example, an organic molecule may be assayed for its ability to inhibit PDE10 activity, as well as PDE1A, PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE2A, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A, PDE6A, PDE6B, PDE6C, PDE7A, PDE7B, PDE8A, PDE8B, PDE9A, and/or PDE11A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhosphodiesterase enzymes including PDE10 have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. This has suggested a potential role for these enzymes in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species. The compounds of the present invention have utility in treating a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating schizophrenia or psychosis comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the present invention.

In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in reference assays by exhibiting the ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of the phosphosphate ester bond of a cyclic nucleotide. Any compound exhibiting a Ki (inhibitory constant) below 1 μM would be considered a PDE10 inhibitor as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a typical experiment the PDE10 inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined in accordance with the following experimental method. PDE10A2 was amplified from human fetal brain cDNA (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.) using a forward primer corresponding to nucleotides 56-77 of human PDE10A2 (Accession No. AF127480, Genbank Identifier 4894716), containing a Kozak consensus sequence, and a reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 2406-2413 of human PDE10A2 (Accession No. AF127480, Genbank Identifier 4894716). Amplification with Easy-A polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) was 95° C. for 2 minutes followed by thirty three cycles of 95° C. for 40 seconds, 55° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 2 minutes 48 seconds. Final extension was 72° C. for 7 minutes. The PCR product was TA cloned into pcDNA3.2-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to standard protocol. AD293 cells with 70-80% confluency were transiently transfected with human PDE10A2/pcDNA3.2-TOPO using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer specifications (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and lysed by sonication (setting 3, 10×5 sec pulses) in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysate was collected by centrifugation at 75,000×g for 20 minutes. Supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was used for evaluation of PDE10A2 activity. The fluorescence polarization assay for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases was performed using an IMAP® FP kit supplied by Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif. (product #R8139). IMAP® technology has been applied previously to phosphodiesterase assays (Huang, W., et al., \nJ. Biomol Screen, \n2002, 7: 215). Assays were performed at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 μL. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 8 μL of each of 10 solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition is determined using a known PDE10 inhibitor, which can be any compound that is present at 5,000 times its Ki value in the assay described as follows, such as papaverine (see Siuciak, et al. \nNeuropharmacology \n(2006) 51:386-396; Becker, et al. \nBehav Brain Res \n(2008) 186(2):155-60; Threlfell, et al., \nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther \n(2009) 328(3):785-795), 2-{4-[pyridin-4-yl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]phenoxymethyl}quinoline succinic acid or 2-[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenoxymethyl]quinoline succinic acid (see Schmidt, et al. \nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther \n(2008) 325:681-690; Threlfell, et al., \nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther \n(2009) 328(3): 785-795). 0% of inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Labcyte Echo 555 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, Calif.) is used to dispense 200 nL from each well of the titration plate to the 384 well assay plate. A solution of enzyme (1/1600 dilution from aliquots; sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) and a separate solution of FAM-labeled cAMP PDE from Molecular Devices (product #R7506), at a final concentration of 50 nM are made in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.05% NaN\n3 \n0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT). The enzyme and the substrate are then added to the assay plates in two consecutive additions of 10 μL, and then shaken to mix. The reaction is allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 minutes. A binding solution is then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction is stopped by addition of 60 μL of the binding solution to each well of the assay plates and the plates are sealed and shaken for 10 seconds. The plate was incubated at room temperature for at least one hour prior to determining the fluorescence polarization (FP). The parallel and perpendicular fluorescence of each well of the plate was measured using a Perkin Elmer EnVision™ plate reader (Waltham, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescence polarization (mP) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) fluorescence of each sample well and the analogous values for the median control well, containing only substrate (So and Po), using the following equation: Polarization (mP)=1000*(S/So−P/Po)/(S/So+P/Po).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDose-inhibition profiles for each compound were characterized by fitting the mP data to a four-parameter equation given below. The apparent inhibition constant (KO, the maximum inhibition at the low plateau relative to “100% Inhibition Control” (Imax; e.g. 1=>same as this control), the minimum inhibition at the high plateau relative to the “0% Inhibition Control” (Imin, e.g. 0=>same as the no drug control) and the Hill slope (nH) are determined by a non-linear least squares fitting of the mP values as a function of dose of the compound using an in-house software based on the procedures described by Mosser et al., \nJALA, \n2003, 8: 54-63, using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nImax\n\n\n-\n\n\nImin\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nDrug\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\npK\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nSubstrate\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nnH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\nImax\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe median signal of the “0% inhibition controls” (0% mP) and the median signal of the “100% inhibition controls” (100% mP) are constants determined from the controls located in columns 1-2 and 23-24 of each assay plate. An apparent (K\nm\n) for FAM-labeled cAMP of 150 nM was determined in separate experiments through simultaneous variation of substrate and selected drug concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelectivity for PDE10, as compared to other PDE families, was assessed using the IMAP® technology. Rhesus PDE2A3 and Human PDE10A2 enzyme was prepared from cytosolic fractions of transiently transfected HEK cells. All other PDE's were GST Tag human enzyme expressed in insect cells and were obtained from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, Calif.): PDE1A (Cat#60010), PDE3A (Cat#60030), PDE4A1A (Cat#60040), PDE5A1 (Cat#60050), PDE6C (Cat#60060), PDE7A (Cat#60070), PDE8A1 (Cat#60080), PDE9A2 (Cat#60090), PDE11A4 (Cat#60110).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays for PDE 1 through 11 were performed in parallel at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 μL. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 30 μL of each of ten solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition was determined by adding buffer in place of the enzyme and 0% inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations). A Labcyte POD 810 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, Calif.) was used to dispense 200 nL from each well of the titration plate to make eleven copies of the assay plate for each titration, one copy for each PDE enzyme. A solution of each enzyme (dilution from aliquots, sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) and a separate solution of FAM-labeled cAMP or FAM-labeled cGMP from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif., product #R7506 or cGMP#R7508), at a final concentration of 50 nM were made in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.05% NaN\n3 \n0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT). Note that the substrate for PDE2 is 50 nM FAM cAMP containing 1000 nM of cGMP. The enzyme and the substrate were then added to the assay plates in two consecutive additions of 10 μL and then shaken to mix. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. A binding solution was then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 60 μL of the binding solution to each well of the assay plate. The plates were sealed and shaken for 10 seconds. The plates were incubated at room temperature for one hour, then the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). The apparent inhibition constants for the compounds against all 11 PDE's was determined from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescent readings as described for PDE10 FP assay using the following apparent K\nM \nvalues for each enzyme and substrate combination: PDE1A (FAM cGMP) 70 nM, rhesus PD2A3 (FAM cAMP) 10,000 nM, PDE3A (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE4A1A (FAM cAMP) 1500 nM, PDE5A1 (FAM cGMP) 400 nM, PDE6C (FAM cGMP) 700 nM, PDE7A (FAM cAMP) 150 nM, PDE8A1 (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE9A2 (FAM cGMP) 60 nM, PDE10A2 (FAM cAMP) 150 nM, PDE11A4 (FAM cAMP) 1000 nM. The intrinsic PDE10 inhibitory activity of a compound which may be used in accordance with the present invention may be determined by these assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the human PDE10 enzyme in the aforementioned assays with an Ki of less than about 1 μM. Many of compounds within the present invention had activity in inhibiting the human PDE10 enzyme in the aforementioned assays, generally with an Ki of less than about 0.1 μM. Additional data is provided in the following Examples. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors of the PDE10 enzyme. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that a substance is considered to effectively inhibit PDE10 activity if it has a Ki of less than or about 1 μM, preferably less than or about 0.1 μM. The present invention also includes compounds within the generic scope of the invention which possess activity as inhibitors of other phosphodiesterase enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject compounds are further useful in a method for the prevention, treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of the diseases, disorders and conditions noted herein.

The compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of diseases or conditions for which compounds of the present invention or the other drugs may have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the present invention. When a compound of the present invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of the present invention may be desirable. However, the combination therapy may also includes therapies in which the compound of the present invention and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compounds of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention.

Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the present invention. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention. The weight ratio of the compound of the present invention to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the present invention is combined with another agent, the weight ratio of the compound of the present invention to the other agent will generally range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, such as about 200:1 to about 1:200.

The terms “administration of” and or “administering a” compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention or a prodrug of a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “composition” as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising specified ingredients in predetermined amounts or proportions, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. Such term in relation to pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. In general, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by mixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. Compositions for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients are mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions, oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, oil-in-water emulsions, and sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension may be prepared by standard methods known in the art. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject compounds are further useful in a method for the prevention, treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of the diseases, disorders and conditions noted herein. The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The active ingredient may be administered to patients (animals and human) in need of such treatment in dosages that will provide optimal pharmaceutical efficacy. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. The dose will vary from patient to patient depending upon the nature and severity of disease, the patient's weight, special diets then being followed by a patient, concurrent medication, and other factors which those skilled in the art will recognize. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.001 to 10 mg/kg. of body weight daily are administered to the patient, e.g., humans and elderly humans. The dosage range will generally be about 0.5 mg to 1.0 g. per patient per day which may be administered in single or multiple doses. In one embodiment, the dosage range will be about 0.5 mg to 500 mg per patient per day; in another embodiment about 0.5 mg to 200 mg per patient per day; and in yet another embodiment about 5 mg to 50 mg per patient per day. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be provided in a solid dosage formulation such as comprising about 0.5 mg to 500 mg active ingredient, or comprising about 1 mg to 250 mg active ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition may be provided in a solid dosage formulation comprising about 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 250 mg active ingredient. For oral administration, the compositions may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, such as 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated.

These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions which are commonly known to those skilled in the art. In some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoc-protected ethyl 4-oxopiperidine-3-carboxylate can be condensed with a variety of commercially available amidinium salts (wherein “B” is pyridyl substituted with R\n1a\n, R\n1b \nand R\n1c\n) to afford protected tetrahydropyrido-pyrimidinones A-1. Chlorination under mild conditions affords the aromatic chloro compound A-2. Acidic deprotection affords the free tetrahydropyridopyrimidine A-3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe orthogonal reactivity of the chloro tetrahydropyridopyrimidine A-2 is highlighted in Reaction Scheme B. SNAr-mediated functionalization can readily precede Boc-deprotection, allowing rapid access to analogs of the form B-1. Deprotection and acylation under otherwise identical conditions affords an alternate route to the fully elaborated products, A-4.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to the limited number of commercially available amindinium hydrochloride salts, and in order to gain rapid access to diversity at B, an alternate approach to A-4 was developed. Beginning with commercially available tert-butyl-2,4-dichloro-7,8-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine-6(5H)-carboxylate, a regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution, selective for the 4-chloro position, can be carried out under mild conditions to provide mono-chloro compound C-1. Generally, regioisomeric ratios are >15:1. A Suzuki cross coupling reaction with the remaining activated chlorine affords direct access to a number of alternate analogs of B-1. Deprotection of the Boc group and acylation follow as previously described.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleophilic character of the tetrahydropyridopyrimidinone oxygen atom of A-1 provides yet another versatile handle for an alternate preparation of the fully elaborated target compounds, D-1 and D-2. A-1 can be treated with primary and secondary alkyl bromides and iodides under basic conditions to afford clean O-alkylation to B-1. While the scope of available electrophiles is limited, this approach obviates the intermediate chlorination step. D-1 is elaborated to D-2 as previously described. Additionally, due to a lack of commercially available heterocyclic isocyanates, an alternate approach for preparing D-2 of this form is required. As such, treatment of commercially available carboxylic acids with DPPA provides indirect access to the requisite isocyanates in situ (via the acyl azide), which can then be reacted with D-1 to afford D-2. Further, standard amide coupling conditions can be employed to alter the functionality off the piperidine nitrogen, to provide D-1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further optimized modification of the general procedure, an expedited synthesis of compounds of the form D-2 was developed through a novel 3-component coupling reaction. Beginning with ethyl-4-piperidone-3-carboxylate hydrochloride, DPPA-mediated urea formation provides direct access to N-functionalized piperidines of the form E-1. Single-pot treatment with an amindinium salt and an alkyl halide in the presence of base provides direct access to fully elaborated D-2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSulfonamides of the formula F-1 are prepared under standard conditions involving Boc deprotection of B-1 followed by treatment of the liberated amine with variably functionalized sulfonyl chlorides.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN-aryl compounds of the form G-1 are prepared under standard conditions involving Boc deprotection of B-1 followed by SNAr reaction with the corresponding aromatic chlorides.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1-tert-butyl 3-ethyl 4-oxopiperidine-1,3-dicarboxylate (A-1)\n\n\n \n \n \nA suspension of ethyl-4-piperidone-3-carboxylate hydrochloride (10 g, 48.2 mmol) in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(400 mL) was treated with TEA (20.14 mL, 144 mmol) and Boc-anhydride (13.42 mL, 57.8 mmol).
