Description\n\n\n\n\n Peptide for Use in the Treatment of Breast Cancer \n\n\n and/or Bone Metastases \n\n\n Technical Field of the Invention: \n\n\nThe invention relates to a specific therapy form for the treatment of cancer, especially tumors (or tumours) and tumor metastases, comprising the administration of a Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe- Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof for use in the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans, optionally together with cancer cotherapeutic agents or other cancer cotherapeutic therapy forms that preferably enhance, additively or \n\n\nsynergistically, the efficacy when administered together with said Peptide, such as chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapeutics, including antibodies, radioimmunoconjugates and immunocytokines and or radiation therapy. More specifically, the instant invention relates to the use of at least one Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans, wherein the medicament is optionally to be used in combination with a) hormone modulating agents, \n\n\nb) osteoclast activity modulating agents, \n\n\nc) cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and/or \n\n\nd) radiotherapy. Additionally, the instant invention relates to methods of treatment, using said medicament. Preferably, the administration of the medicament can be done in a timely controlled manner. The therapy using one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents or other cancer cotherapeutic therapy forms will preferably result in a synergistic potential increase of the inhibition effect of each individual therapeutic on tumor cell and tumor endothelial cell proliferation, preferably yielding a more effective treatment than found by administering an individual component alone, together or in another therapy regime but the regime of the present invention. \n\n\nPreferably, said Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) \n\n and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof are preferred examples of the term \"specific integrin ligand\" as used herein. \n\n\nBackground of the Invention: \n\n\n Vascular endothelial cells are known to contain at least three RGD- dependent integrins, including the vitronectin receptors α\nν\nβ3 or α\nν\nβ\nδ\n as well as the collagen types I and IV receptors α\nν\nβι and α\n2\nβι, the laminin receptors α\n6\nβι and a^, and the fibronectin receptor α\n5\nβι (Davis et al., 1993, J. Cell. Biochem. 51 , 206). The smooth muscle cell is known to contain at least six RGD-dependent integrins, including α\nν\nβ\n3\n and α\nν\nβ\nδ\n. \n\n\nInhibition of cell adhesion in vitro using monoclonal antibodies \n\n\nimmunospecific for various integrin a or β subunits have implicated the vitronectin receptor α\nν\nβ\n3\n in cell adhesion processes of a variety of cell types including microvascular endothelial cells (Davis et al., 1993, J. Cell. Biol. 51 , 206). \n\n\n Integrins are a class of cellular receptors known to bind extracellular matrix proteins, and mediate cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions, referred generally to as cell adhesion events. The integrin receptors constitute a family of proteins with shared structural characteristics of non- covalenty associated heterodimeric glycoprotein complexes formed of a and β subunits. The vitronectin receptor, named for its original characteristic of preferential binding to vitronectin, is now known to refer to four different integrins, designated α\nν\nβι, α\nν\nβ\n3\n, o^s and ot^e. α\nν\nβι binds fibronectin and vitronectin. α\nν\nβ\n3\n binds a large variety of ligands, including fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin, thrombospondin, vitronectin and von Willebrand's factor. α\nν\nβ\nδ\n binds vitronectin. It is clear that there are different integrins with different biological functions as well as different integrins and subunits having shared biological specificity and function. One important recognition site in a ligand for many integrins is the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence. RGD is found in all of the ligands identified above for the vitronectin receptor \n\n integrins. The molecular basis of RGD recognition by α\nν\nβ3 has been identified (Xiong et al., 2001)This RGD recognition site can be mimicked by linear and cyclic (poly)peptides that contain the RGD sequence. Such RGD peptides are known to be inhibitors or antagonists, respectively, of integrin function. It is important to note, however, that depending upon the sequence and structure of the RGD peptide, the specificity of the inhibition can be altered to target specific integrins. Various RGD polypeptides of varying integrin specificity have been described, for example, by Cheresh, et al., 1989, Cell 58, 945, Aumailley et al., 1991 , FEBS Letts. 291, 50, and in numerous patent applications and patents (e.g. US patents 4,517,686, 4,578,079, 4,589,881 , 4,614,517, 4,661 ,111 , 4,792,525; EP 0770 622). \n\n\n The generation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, plays a key role in the growth of malignant disease and this has generated much interest in developing agents that inhibit angiogenesis. \n\n\n Nevertheless, although various combination therapies utilizing potential angiogenesis inhibitors are under investigation, in clinical trials and on the market, the outcome of these therapies are not fruitful enough. Therefore, there still exists a need in the art to develop further combinations which can show increased efficacy and reduced side-effects. \n\n\nIt is known today that tumor vasculature is different from vasculature of healthy tissue. The vasculature is characteristic for the tumor and distinct from the stable, dormant vasculature of healthy tissue. It is often \n\n\ncharacterized by an increased expression and priming of specific cell adhesion molecules of the alpha-v-integrin series, especially α\nν\nβ3 and α\nν\nβδ. When activated these integrins enhance the cellular response to growth factors that drive angiogenesis, for example VEGFA and FGF2: VEGFA was originally termed vascular permeability factor, and it acts via the SRC kinase pathway to increase local vascular permeability. VEGRF2, when activated, increases the activity of α\nν\nβ3 integrin. \n\n\n Further, solid tumors depend on an induced and cooped vasculature from the host to develop. This vasculature has unusual molecular properties that distinguish it from the normal host vasculature: it tends to be activated, i.e. \n\n progressing through cell cycle under the influence of tumor-derived factors like VEGFs, FGFs and others, and expresses endothelial activation markers like ICAM, VCAM and alpha-v-series Integrins, e.g. α\nν\nβ\n3\n and α\nν\nβ5, in a ligand competent state. It has a defective extracellular matrix, and is classically described as leaky. It is notable that tumors often resist therapies \n\n\nsystemically applied via the blood stream, due to abnormal nature of tumor vasculature. \n\n\n The metastatic process is a multistep event and represents the most dreadful aspect of cancer. At the moment of diagnosis, cancers are frequently far advanced in their natural history, and the presence of metastases is a common event. In fact, approximately 30% of patients have detectable metastases at the moment of clinical diagnosis and a further 30% of patients have occult metastases. Metastases can be disseminated and they can infest different organs at the same time, or localize to a specific organ. In the case of localized disease, surgery is the treatment of choice; however recurrence and prognosis depend on many criteria such as: resectability, patient's clinical situation, and number of metastases. \n\n\n After resection, recurrence is common, suggesting that micrometastatic foci are present at the moment of diagnosis. Systemic chemotherapy is an ideal setting but only few patients are cured by it, and in the majority systemic chemotherapy fails. Many physiological barriers and pharmacokinetic parameters contribute to decrease its efficacy. \n\n\n Liver, lungs and lymph nodes are filtration organs and therefore inclined to metastasization. The poor chemosensitivity of metastases, peculiarly those of colorectal origin has forced many researchers to use methods for increasing the time and the concentration of drugs. The need for decreasing or limiting the side effects for this important and delicate organ led to the development of the technique of liver isolation for perfusion of antineoplastic agents. (K. R. Aigner, Isolated liver perfusion. In: Morris DL, McArdle CS, Onik GM, eds. Hepatic Metastases. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 1996. 101-107). Since 1981 , modifications and technical improvements have been continuously introduced. Liver metastases may be of different origin and their \n\n chemosensitivity may vary according to the histological type and their response in presence of heat. \n\n\n There still exists a growing need in the art in order to develop new \n\n\ntherapeutic strategies for treating cancer, especially metastases systemically. The object of the present invention therefore was to develop such a new strategy. It should be applicable to systemic treatment, and it should lower the dose and/or increase the efficiency of the cancer therapeutical agents to be applied. A further object was to normalize tumor vasculature to increase delivery of systemic therapeutics of tumor, i.e. to reset the tumor vasculature to the functionality of the vasculature of non-tumor tissue. \n\n\nThus, it is a preferred objective of the instant invention to provide a more effective, better tolerated treatment for humans, especially human cancer patients suffering from breast cancer and/or bone metastases, preferably breast cancer and/or bone metastases independent from their origin, thus preferably leading to enhanced overal survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QOL) and/or increased median survival. Summary of the Invention: \n\n\n The present inventions preferably describe for the first time a novel pharmaceutical treatment which is based on a new concept in breast cancer and/or bone metastases therapy to administer to an individual in a \n\n\ntherapeutically effective amount a specific integrin ligand which is the Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, optionally in combination with one or more specified chemotherapeutic agents and/or cancer \n\n\ncotherapeutic agents as described herein. Advantagously, this can preferably be done according to one or more of the regimens as described herein. \n\n\nThus, subject of the instant invention is the use of Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof for the manufacture of a medicament \n\n for the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases, wherein the medicament is optionally to be used in combination with one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents other than said Peptide, said cancer cotherapeutic agents preferably being selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\na) hormone modulating agents, \n\n\nb) osteoclast activity modulating agents, \n\n\nc) cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and \n\n\nd) radiotherapy, \n\n\nand methods of treating breast cancer and/or bone metastases using said medicament. Said hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and/or cancer chemotherapeutic agents are preferably as described below. \n\n\nSurprisingly, it can be shown that the tumor vasculature can be functionally normalized by systemically applied Peptides of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly- Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof as defined herein. Said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof preferably increase the amount of cancer cotherapeutic agents as described herein and especially the amount of cancer cotherapeutic agents selected from the group consisting of hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and cancer chemotherapeutic agents, entering the tumor. Said hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and/or cancer chemotherapeutic agents are preferably as described below. In addition, the Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof can preferably be shown to enhance the numbers of leukocytes entering the tumor following systemic \n\n\nimmunocytokines therapy, and may directly or indirectly increase the amounts of antibodies entering the tumor compartment on anti-tumor antibody therapy, or increase access to anti-tumor vaccines. \n\n\nFurthermore, it is believed that this functional normalization of the tumor vasculature will lead to changes in the metabolism of the tumor, e.g. a higher \n\n oxygen concentration in the tumor, and thus allows oxygen dependent therapies, like external beam radiotherapy, to become more effective. \n\n\nThe increased local amount of the cancer cotherapeutic agents is believed to help to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms, and enhances therapeutic index. . \n\n\n In one embodiment the present invention relates to a composition comprising as the cotherapeutic agent therapeutically active compounds, preferably selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents and immunotoxic agents, and as the case may be other \n\n\npharmacologically active compounds which may enhance the efficacy of said agents or reduce the side effects of said agents. \n\n\nAccording to the present invention therapeutically active compositions may also be provided by means of a pharmaceutical kit comprising a package comprising at least a Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe- Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, and one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, preferably as described herein, e.g. hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and/or cancer chemotherapeutic agents as described herein, in single packages or in separate containers. The therapy with these combinations may include optionally further treatment with radiation. Said hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and/or cancer chemotherapeutic agents are preferably as described below. \n\n\nThe invention relates furthermore to a new therapy form for treating breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans, comprising the administration of a Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof prior to or after radiotherapy, preferably prior to radiotherapy. \n\n\n In this new therapy form for treating breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans comprising the administration of a Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg- Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, \n\n solvates and/or salts thereof prior to radiotherapy, it is a preferred feature that said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof is administered prior to the further cancer cotherapeutic agent. In this context, according to the present invention, radiation, or, radiotherapy has to be understood as a cancer cotherapeutic agent. \n\n\nGenerally, this prior application takes place 1 to 8 hours (h), preferably 1 to 5 h, and more preferably 1 to 3 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent. Even more preferably, this prior application takes place 2 to 8 hours (h), preferably 2 to 6 h, and more preferably 2 to 4 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent, such as 1 to 2 h, 2 to 3 h, 3 to 6 h, 2 to 5 h or 3 to 7 h before the application of the further cancer therapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\". \n\n\nAs is shown by the data contained in this application, the effect according to the invention is achieved in non-human animals, especially rats, if this prior application preferably takes place 1 to 8 hours (h), preferably 1 to 5 h, and more preferably 1 to 3 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent; and even more preferably this prior application takes place 2 to 8 hours (h), preferably 2 to 6 h, and more preferably 2 to 4 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent, such as 1 to 2 h, 2 to 3 h, 3 to 6 h, 2 to 5 h or 3 to 7 h before the application of the further cancer therapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\". \n\n\nHowever, the data from experiments with human animals preferably shows that the time of the above/below described and discussed \"prior application\" can be delayed or multiplied by the factor 1 to 4 and especially 2 to 4. This difference in the response or response time between non-human animals, \n\n especially rodents, such as rats, and human animals is known and \n\n\nextensively discussed in the art. While the applicant wishes not to be bound by this theory, he believes that this difference is at least in part caused by the different pharmacokinetic behavior of the different species, which i. a. reflects in different halflives (ti/\n2\n) in the different kinds of animals. For example, for compounds such as cyclopeptides, the halflives in rats usually are in the range of 10-30 minutes, whereas the halflives in human animals for the same compounds are within 2 to 6 hours and especially 3 to 4 hours. \n\n\nAccordingly, a subject of this application is a method of treatment and/or a method of manufacture as described above/below, wherein the prior application preferably takes place 1 to 32 hours (h), preferably 2 to 32 h, more preferably 2 to 24 h, even more preferably 4 to 24 h, even more preferably 6 to 20 h and especially 6 to 16 h, before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent; or alternatively preferably this prior application takes place 6 to 32 hours (h), preferably 10 to 24 h, and more preferably 12 to 20 h before the application of the further cancer \n\n\ncotherapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\" \n\n\nA further subject of this application is a method of treatment and/or a method of manufacture as described above/below, wherein the prior application preferably takes place 18 to 23 h hours (h), preferably 20 to 23 h, more preferably 20 to 22 h before the application of the further cancer \n\n\ncotherapeutic agent; or alternatively preferably this prior application takes place 25 to 32 h hours (h), preferably 25 to 30 h, and more preferably 26 to 30 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\" \n\n\nHowever, in a more preferred aspect of the instant invention, the timed \n\n administration (regardless of whether the patient is a human or nonhuman animal) of the specific integrin ligand takes place 1 to 10 hours (h), preferably 2 to 8 h, more preferably 2 to 6 h, even more preferably 3 to 8 h, even more preferably 3 to 6 h and especially 4 to 8 h prior to the application of the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, e.g. 1 to 2 h, 1 to 3 h, 1 to 4 h, 2 to 3 h, 2 to 4 h, 2 to 6 h, 2 to 8 h, 2 to 10 h, 3 to 4 h, 3 to 10 h, 4 to 6 h, 4 to 10 h, 5 to 8 or 5 to 10 h. This is especially preferred if the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents comprise external beam radiation or consist of external beam radiation. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed \n\n\napplication\". \n\n\nWith respect to said timed administration or timed application (of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof), the hours given for said prior administration or application preferably refer to the beginning or start of the respective administration or application. Accordingly, for example, an administration of the specific integrin ligand starting three hours before the application of the respective cancer \n\n\ncotherapeutic agent is to be regarded as a timed administration or timed application 3 h prior to the application of the one or more cancer \n\n\ncotherapeutic agents according to the invention, even if the specific integrin ligand is administered by i. v. Infusion that takes an hour or two hours to be completed. This definition of prior application/prior administration is in perfect concordance with the understanding of the ones skilled in the art. \n\n\nIf said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof is administered to the patient in a timed administration as described herein, it is preferably timed with respect to the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents it is combined with. With respect to the timed \n\n\nadministration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof in combination with two or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, it is preferably timed with respect to the two or \n\n more cancer cotherapeutic agents, more preferably timed with respect to at least one of the cancer cotherapeutic agents. If the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents comprise radiotherapy, especially radiotherapy as described herein, the timed administration preferably refers at least to the radiotherapy. \n\n\nEspecially preferably, the timed administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof refers to radiotherapy as the time-relevant cancer cotherapeutic. Accordingly, in the timed administration, the prior administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof preferably refers to a time prior to the administration of radiotherapy. \n\n\nHowever, in many cases, it can be advantageous also to administer the one or more further cancer cotherapeutic agents other than radiotherapy within the time window given by the timed administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof and the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy. \n\n\nMore preferably, the timed administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof refers to the administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof and of the radiotherapy, and the additional cancer cotherapeutic agent is preferably administered after the administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, such as 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 hours after the administration of this Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, but preferably before the \n\n\nadministration or delivery of the radiotherapy, preferably at least within one hour before the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy, and more preferably at least 1 hour before radiotherapy, for example 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 h prior to the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy. \n\n It should be understood, however, that the administration of any combination of the present invention can optionally be accompanied by radiation therapy, wherein radiation treatment can preferably be done after the administration of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof. The administration of the different agents of the combination therapy according to the invention can optionally also be achieved substantially concurrently or sequentially. \n\n\nIt is known that tumors elicit alternative routes for their development and growth. If one route is blocked they often have the capability to switch to another route by expressing and using other receptors and signaling pathways. Therefore, the pharmaceutical combinations of the present invention may block several of such possible development strategies of the tumor and thus preferably provide various therapeutic benefits. The \n\n\ncombinations according to the present invention are preferably useful in treating and preventing tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders and tumor metastases, more preferably tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders of the breast and tumor metastases, even more preferably tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders of the breast and tumor metastases thereof, and especially such which develop and grow by activation of their relevant hormone receptors which are present on the surface of the tumor cells. \n\n\nPreferably, the different combined agents of the present invention are administered at a low dose, that is, at a dose lower than has been \n\n\nconventionally used in clinical situations. A benefit of lowering the dose of the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies of the present invention administered to an individual includes a decrease in the incidence of adverse effects associated with higher dosages. For example, by the lowering the dosage of an agent described above and below, a reduction in the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting will result when compared to that observed at higher dosages. By lowering the incidence of adverse effects, an improvement in the quality of life of a cancer patient is expected. Further benefits of lowering the incidence of adverse effects include an improvement \n\n in patient compliance, a reduction in the number of hospitalizations needed for the treatment of adverse effects, and a reduction in the administration of analgesic agents needed to treat pain associated with the adverse \n\n\neffects. Alternatively, the methods and combination of the present invention can also maximize the therapeutic effect at higher doses. \n\n\nTumors, preferably such which show an increased expression and priming of specific cell adhesion molecules of the alpha-v-integrin series, especially α\nν\nβ3 and α\nν\nβδ in their vasculature, may be successfully treated by the \n\n\ncombinations and therapeutic regimen according to the invention. The combinations within the pharmaceutical treatment according to the invention preferably show an astonishing synergetic effect. In administering the combination of drugs real tumor shrinking and disintegration could be observed during clinical studies while no significant adverse drug reactions were detectable. \n\n\nFurther embodiments of the present invention preferably relate to: \n\n\nA method for the production of a medicament for the timed and combined use as a combination therapy for the treatment of cancer, the medicament comprising, preferably in two distinct (discrete) application forms, \n\n\na composition containing at least one specific integrin ligand, and \n\n\na composition containing one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and optionally \n\n\nat least one further cancer cotherapeutic agent different from the at least one specific integrin ligand of a) and from the one or more alkylating \n\n\nchemotherapeutic agents of b). \n\n\nA method for the treatment of cancer in a subject, comprising \n\n\na) administering to the subject at least one specific integrin ligand, \n\n\nb) administering to the subject one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and optionally \n\n c) administering to the subject at least one further cancer cotherapeutic agent different from the at least one specific integrin ligand of a) and from the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents of b). \n\n\nA said medicament or method, wherein the at least one integrin ligand is selected from the group consisting of a\nv\n integrin inhibitors, preferably α\nν\nββ inhibitors, most preferably cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), the \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof. \n\n\nA said medicament or method, wherein the at least one cancer-cotherapeutic agent is selected from the group consisting of chemotherapeutical agents, cytotoxic agents, immunotoxic agents and radiotherapy. \n\n\nA set for the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans comprising independent dosage forms of: \n\n\na) a therapeutically effective amount of the Peptide of the formula Cyclo- (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, more preferably of cyclo-(Arg- Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), \n\n\nb) and optionally one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\n i) hormone modulating agents, \n\n\n ii) osteoclast activity modulating agents, \n\n\n and/or \n\n\n iii) cancer chemotherapeutic agents, \n\n\noptionally wherein a) is to be administered 1 to 8 hours (h), preferably 2 to 7 h, and most preferably 1 to 3 h prior to the application of at least one cancer cotherapeutic agent according b). Said hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and/or \n\n\ncancer chemotherapeutic agents are preferably as described below. \n\n\nSaid set is further characterized in that it will be advantageous to give detailed instructions to and how to use said Peptide and/or the \n\n pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, and/or detailed instructions to and how to use the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agent, in connection with said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically \n\n\nacceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, preferably in form of a specific packaging, specific package inserts and similar. \n\n\nTherefore, a further preferred embodiment of the present invention is a medicament consisting of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically \n\n\nacceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, as one active ingredient, designed for use in the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans, optionally for use in combination with a further cancer cotherapeutic agent, preferably prior to the further cancer cotherapeutic agent, e.g. in the case of radiotherapy, and contained in a container or similar, the container giving in form of writing detailed instructions and/or other technical \n\n\ninformation on how to use said medicament in said treatment and optionally how to use said medicament in combination with one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, e.g. with respect to the above application schedule. \n\n\nA further preferred embodiment of the present invention is the use of the Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, more preferably of cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer in humans, \n\n\nwherein the medicament is to be used in combination with one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, preferably two or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, more preferably three or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, and especially in combination with one, two, three or four cancer cotherapeutic agents, \n\n\nwherein the cancer cotherapeutic agents are selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\ni) hormone modulating agents, \n\n\nii) osteoclast activity modulating agents, \n\n and/or \n\n\niii) cancer chemotherapeutic agents. \n\n\n In said embodiment, said hormone modulating agents, osteoclast activity modulating agents and/or cancer chemotherapeutic agents are preferably as described below.

The combinations according to the present invention are preferably useful in treating and preventing tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders. Preferably, the different combined agents of the present invention are administered in combination at a low dose, that is, at a dose lower than has been conventionally used in clinical situations. A benefit of lowering the dose of the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies of the present invention administered to a mammal includes a decrease in the incidence of adverse effects associated with higher dosages. For \n\n example, by the lowering the dosage of a chemotherapeutic agent such as methotrexate, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, bleomycin, cisplatin and/or Melphalan, a reduction in the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting will result when compared to that observed at higher dosages. Similar benefits are contemplated for the compounds, \n\n\ncompositions, agents and therapies in combination with the integrin antagonists of the present invention.

Moreover, these definitions and meanings describe the invention in more detail, preferred embodiments included. \n\n\n If not otherwise pointed out, the reference to a compound to be used according according to the invention preferably includes the reference to the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof. If not otherwise pointed out, the reference to the integrin ligands, integrin \n\n\nantagonists, integrin agonists, as well as the reference to the cancer- cotherapeutic agents that are compounds, preferably chemically derived compounds, preferably includes the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and salts thereof. Even more preferably, the reference to the integrin ligand cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) also includes the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and salts thereof, more preferably the pharmaceutically solvates and salts thereof and especially preferably the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, if not indicated otherwise. \n\n\nBy \"combination therapy\" is preferably meant a combination of at least two distinct compounds, agents or therapy forms so combined as to form a single \n\n therapeutical concept, preferably in a consecutive and/or simultaneous manner. A combination therapy thus can comprise two or more compounds, agents or therapy forms, three or more compounds, agents or therapy forms, four or more compounds, agents or therapy forms, such as two, three, four, five or six compounds, agents or therapy forms, \n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the present invention this means the \n\n\ncombination of said Peptide and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, with one, two, three or four, preferably one, two or three, further cotherapeutic agents. It is important to note that \"combination therapy\" preferably does not mean a distinct and/or single pharmaceutical composition or medicament. By way of contrast, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention said Peptide and the further cotherapeutic agent(s) are provided in discrete containers, packages, medicaments, formulations or equivalents. Equally, the combination of said Peptide with radiotherapy or radiation therapy preferably lies within the meaning of \"combination therapy\" of the present invention. \n\n\n\"Therapy forms\" preferably are any means, uses and/or formulations for treating cancer known in the art. By the term \"distinct therapy forms\" therefore it is meant that two different means, uses and/or formulations for treating cancer are combined. In the context of the present invention it is preferred that the first to be applied therapy form has anti-integrin activity (synonym: integrin ligand) and is preferably said Peptide, and is applied prior to the second therapy form, preferably following the schedule as detailed above. \n\n\nThe term \"composition comprising radiotherapy\" preferably simply means that subsequent to said Peptide radiotherapy is applied. Therefore, the term \"composition comprising radiotherapy\" in the context of the present invention preferably does not apply to a pharmaceutical composition as such, but to a pharmaceutical composition to be used in combination with radiotherapy. \n\n With \"cancer-cotherapeutic agent\" or \"cancer cotherapeutic agent\" preferably a cytotoxic, chemotherapeutical or immunotoxic agent is meant, more preferably, each cancer cotherapeutic agent for use according to the invention is independently selected from \n\n\ni) hormone modulating agents, \n\n\nii) osteoclast activity modulating agents, \n\n\niii) cancer chemotherapeutic agents, \n\n\nand/or \n\n\niv) radiotherapy. \n\n\n Accordingly, a preferred example of a cancer cotherapeutic agent for use according to the invention is radiotherapy. The terms \"cancer-cotherapeutic agent\" and/or \"cancer cotherapeutic agent\" preferably also include targeted therapeutics, targeted specific therapeutics and/or targeted specific agents. However the terms \"cancer-cotherapeutic agent\" and/or \"cancer \n\n\ncotherapeutic agent\" as used herein are preferably different from the specific integrin ligands as described herein and thus preferably do not include such specific integrin ligands. \n\n\nThe terms \"cancer-cotherapeutic agent\" and/or \"cancer cotherapeutic agent\" as used herein are preferably different from the Peptide of the formula Cyclo- (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof described herein and thus preferably do not include the Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof ligands. \n\n\nA \"receptor\" or \"receptor molecule\" is preferably a soluble or membrane bound or membrane associated protein or glycoprotein comprising one or more domains to which a ligand binds to form a receptor-ligand complex. By binding the ligand, which may be an agonist or an antagonist the receptor is activated or inactivated and may initiate or block pathway signaling. \n\n\nBy \"ligand\" or \"receptor ligand\" is preferably meant a natural or synthetic \n\n compound which binds a receptor molecule to form a receptor-ligand complex. The term ligand includes agonists, antagonists, and compounds with partial agonist/antagonist activity. \n\n\n An \"agonist\" or \"receptor agonist\" is preferably a natural or synthetic compound which binds the receptor to form a receptor-agonist complex by activating said receptor and receptor-agonist complex, respectively, initiating a pathway signaling and further biological processes. \n\n\nBy \"antagonist\" or \"receptor antagonist\" is preferably meant a natural or synthetic compound that has a biological effect opposite to that of an agonist. An antagonist binds the receptor and blocks the action of a receptor agonist by competing with the agonist for receptor. An antagonist is defined by its ability to block the actions of an agonist. A receptor antagonist may be also an antibody or an immunotherapeutically effective fragment thereof. \n\n\nPreferred antagonists according to the present invention are cited and discussed below. \n\n\n The term \"integrin antagonists / inhibitors\" or \"integrin receptor antagonists / inhibitors\" preferably refers to a natural or synthetic molecule, preferably a synthetic molecule, that blocks and inhibit an integrin receptor. In some cases, the term includes antagonists directed to the ligands of said integrin receptors (such as for α\nν\nβ3: vitronectin, fibrin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand's factor, thrombospondin, laminin; for α\nν\nβ\n5\n: vitronectin; for α\nν\nβι : f ibronectin and vitronectin; for α\nν\nββ: fibronectin). Antagonists directed to the integrin receptors are preferred according to the invention. Integrin (receptor) antagonists may be natural or synthetic peptides, non-peptides, \n\n\npeptidomimetica, immunoglobulins, such as antibodies or functional fragments thereof, or immunoconjugates (fusion proteins). Preferred integrin inhibitors of the invention are directed to receptor of a\nv\n integrins (e.g. α\nν\nβ3, ανβδ, α\nν\nβ6 and sub-classes). Preferred integrin inhibitors are a\nv\n \n\n\nantagonists, and in particular α\nν\nβ3 antagonists. Preferred cc\nv\n antagonists according to the invention are RGD peptides, peptidomimetic (non-peptide) antagonists and anti-integrin receptor antibodies such as antibodies blocking ccv receptors. \n\n Exemplary, non-immunological α\nν\nβ3 antagonists are described in \n\n\nthe teachings of US 5,753,230 and US 5,766,591. Preferred antagonists are linear and cyclic RGD-containing peptides. Cyclic peptides are, as a rule, more stable and elicit an enhanced serum half-life. The most preferred integrin antagonist of the invention is, however, cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe- NMeVal) (EMD 121974, Cilengitide\n®\n, Merck KGaA, Germany; EP 0770 622) which is efficacious in blocking the integrin receptors α\nν\nβ\n3\n, α\nν\nβι , α\nν\nβ6, ανββ, αι^β3. and preferably especially efficacious with respect to integrin receptors \nν\nβ3 and/or α\nν\nβ\n5\n. As is clear to the ones skilled in the art, the cyclo- (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) can be also applied in the context of the instant invention in the form of a physiologically functional derivative, physiologically acceptable derivative, a solvate and/or a salt thereof. The same preferably also applies to all other compounds or active ingredients to be used in the context of the present invention. \n\n\nThe term \"antibody\" or \"immunoglobulin\" herein is preferably used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. The term generally includes heteroantibodies which are composed of two or more antibodies or fragments thereof of different binding specificity which are linked together. \n\n\nDepending on the amino acid sequence of their constant regions, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \"antibody (immunoglobulin) classes\". There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \"subclasses\" (isotypes), e.g., lgG1 , lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA, and lgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called α, δ, ε, γ and μ respectively. Preferred major class for antibodies according to the invention is IgG, in more detail lgG1 and lgG2. \n\n\n Antibodies are usually glycoproteins having a molecular weight of about 150,000, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy \n\n (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intra-chain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. The variable regions comprise hypervariable regions or \"CDR\" regions, which contain the antigen binding site and are responsible for the specificity of the antibody, and the \"FR\" regions, which are important with respect to the affinity / avidity of the antibody. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \"complementarity determining region\" or \"CDR\" (e.g. residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; and/or those residues from a \"hypervariable loop\" (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1 ), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy \n\n\nchain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 \n\n\n(1987)).The \"FR\" residues (frame work region) are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The \"light chains\" of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. \n\n\n The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein preferably refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous \n\n\nantibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being \n\n directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. Methods for making monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma method described by Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256, 495) and in \"Monoclonal Antibody Technology, The Production and Characterization of Rodent and Human Hybridomas\" (1985, Burdon et al., Eds, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Volume 13, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam), or may be made by well known recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., US 4,816,567). Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:58, 1-597(1991), for example. The term \"chimeric antibody\" preferably means antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to \n\n\ncorresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g.: US 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Methods for making chimeric and humanized antibodies are also known in the art. For example, methods for making chimeric antibodies include those described in patents by Boss (Celltech) and by Cabilly (Genentech) (US 4,816,397; US \n\n\n4,816,567). \n\n\n \"Humanized antibodies\" preferably are forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are \n\n\nhuman immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a \n\n hypervariable region (CDRs) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human \n\n\nimmunoglobulin. Methods for making humanized antibodies are described, for example, by Winter (US 5,225,539) and Boss (Celltech, US 4,816,397). \"Antibody fragments\" preferably comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. \n\n\nExamples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, Fv and Fc fragments, diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s). An \"intact\" antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1 , CH2 and CH3. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen- binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each comprising a single antigen- binding site and a CL and a CH1 region, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. The \"Fc\" region of the antibodies comprises, as a rule, a CH2, CH3 and the hinge region of an lgG1 or lgG2 antibody major class. The hinge region is a group of about 15 amino acid residues which combine the CH1 region with the CH2-CH3 region. Pepsin treatment yields an \"F(ab')2\" fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and \n\n is still capable of cross-linking antigen. \"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen- binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this \n\n\nconfiguration that the three hypervariable regions (CDRs) of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH - VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen- binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a \n\n\nlower affinity than the entire binding site. The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. \"Fab\" fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known (see e.g. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, 1996; US 4,342,566). \"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments preferably comprise the V, and V, domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a Single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. Single-chain FV antibodies are known, for example, from Pliickthun (The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, Vol. 1 13, \n\n\nRosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994)), WO93/16185; US 5,571 ,894; US 5,587,458; Huston et al. (1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85, 5879) or Skerra and Plueckthun (1988, Science 240, 1038). \"Bispecific antibodies\" preferably are single, divalent antibodies (or \n\n\nimmunotherapeutically effective fragments thereof) which have two differently specific antigen binding sites. For example the first antigen binding site is directed to an angiogenesis receptor (e.g. integrin or VEGF receptor), \n\n whereas the second antigen binding site is directed to an ErbB receptor (e.g. EGFR or Her 2). Bispecific antibodies can be produced by chemical techniques (see e.g., Kranz et al. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 5807), by \"polydoma\" techniques (See US 4,474,893) or by recombinant DNA techniques, which all are known per se. Further methods are described in WO 91/00360, WO 92/05793 and WO 96/04305. Bispecific antibodies can also be prepared from single chain antibodies (see e.g., Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85, 5879; Skerra and Plueckthun (1988) Science 240, 1038). These are analogues of antibody variable regions produced as a single polypeptide chain. To form the bispecific binding agent, the single chain antibodies may be coupled together chemically or by \n\n\ngenetic engineering methods known in the art. It is also possible to produce bispecific antibodies according to this invention by using leucine zipper sequences. The sequences employed are derived from the leucine zipper regions of the transcription factors Fos and Jun (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240,1759; for review, see Maniatis and Abel, 1989, Nature 341 , 24). Leucine zippers are specific amino acid sequences about 20-40 residues long with leucine typically occurring at every seventh residue. Such zipper sequences form amphipathic a-helices, with the leucine residues lined up on the hydrophobic side for dimer formation. Peptides corresponding to the leucine zippers of the Fos and Jun proteins form heterodimers preferentially (O'Shea et al., 1989, Science 245, 646). Zipper containing bispecific antibodies and methods for making them are also disclosed in WO 92/10209 and WO 93/11162. A bispecific antibody according the invention may be an antibody, directed to VEGF receptor and ανβ3 receptor as discussed above with respect to the antibodies having single specificity. \n\n\n\"Heteroantibodies\" preferably are two or more antibodies or antibody-binding fragments which are linked together, each of them having a different binding specificity. Heteroantibodies can be prepared by conjugating together two or more antibodies or antibody fragments. Preferred heteroantibodies \n\n\nare comprised of cross-linked Fab/Fab\n*\n fragments. A variety of coupling or crosslinking agents can be used to conjugate the antibodies. Examples are \n\n protein A, carboimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA) and N- succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al. (1984) J. EXP. Med. 160,1686; Liu et a. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 8648). Other methods include those described by Paulus, Behring Inst. Mitt., No. 78, 118 (1985); Brennan et a. (1985) Science 30 Method:81 or Glennie et al. (1987) J. Immunol. 139, 2367. Another method uses o- phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM) for coupling three Fab' fragments (WO \n\n\n91/03493). Multispecific antibodies are in context of this invention also suitable and can be prepared, for example according to the teaching of WO 94/13804 and WO 98/50431. \n\n\n The term \"fusion protein\" preferably refers to a natural or synthetic molecule consisting of one ore more proteins or peptides or fragments thereof having different specificity which are fused together optionally by a linker molecule. As specific embodiment the term includes fusion constructs, wherein at least one protein or peptide is a immunoglobulin or antibody, respectively or parts thereof (\"immunoconjugates\"). \n\n\n The term \"immunoconjugate\" preferably refers to an antibody or \n\n\nimmunoglobulin respectively, or a immunologically effective fragment thereof, which is fused by covalent linkage to a non-immunologically effective molecule. Preferably this fusion partner is a peptide or a protein, which may be glycosylated. Said non-antibody molecule can be linked to the C-terminal of the constant heavy chains of the antibody or to the N-terminals of the variable light and/or heavy chains. The fusion partners can be linked via a linker molecule, which is, as a rule, a 3 - 15 amino acid residues containing peptide. Immunoconjugates according to the invention consist of an immunoglobulin or immunotherapeutically effective fragment thereof, directed to a receptor tyrosine kinase, preferably an ErbB (ErbB1/ErbB2) receptor and an integrin antagonistic peptide, or an angiogenic receptor, preferably an integrin or VEGF receptor and TNFa or a fusion protein consisting essentially of TNFa and IFNy or another suitable cytokine, which is linked with its N- terminal to the C-terminal of said immunoglobulin, preferably the Fc portion thereof. The term includes also corresponding fusion constructs comprising \n\n bi- or multi-specific immunoglobulins (antibodies) or fragments thereof. \n\n\nThe term \"functionally intact derivative\" means according to the \n\n\nunderstanding of this invention preferably a fragment or portion, modification, variant, homologue or a de-immunized form (a modification, wherein epitopes, which are responsible for immune responses, are removed) of a compound, peptide, protein, antibody (immunoglobulin), immunconjugate, etc., that has principally the same biological and / or therapeutic function as compared with the original compound, peptide, protein, antibody \n\n\n(immunoglobulin), immunconjugate, etc. However, the term includes also such derivatives, which elicit a reduced or enhanced efficacy. \n\n\nThe term \"cytokine\" is preferably a generic term for proteins released by one cell population which act on another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines, and traditional \n\n\npolypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); hepatic growth factor; fibroblast growth factor; prolactin; placental lactogen; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); integrin; thrombopoietin (TPO); nerve growth factors such as NGF ; platelet-growth factor; transforming growth factors (TGFs) such as TGFa and TGFp; erythropoietin (EPO); interferons such as IFNa, IFNp, and IFNy; colony stimulating factors such as M-CSF, GM-CSF and G-CSF; interleukins such as IL-1 , IL-1a, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11 , IL-12; and TNFa or TNF . Preferred cytokines according to the invention are interferons and TNFa. \n\n\nThe term \"cytotoxic agent\" as used herein preferably refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is preferably intended to include radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof. The term may \n\n include also members of the cytokine family, preferably IFNy as well as antineoplastic agents having also cytotoxic activity. \n\n\n The term \"chemotherapeutic agent\", \"chemotherapeutical agent\" or \"antineoplastic agent\" is regarded according to the understanding of this invention preferably as a member of the class of \"cytotoxic agents\", as specified above, and includes chemical agents that exert anti-neoplastic effects, i.e., prevent the development, maturation, or spread of neoplastic cells, directly on the tumor cell, e.g., by cytostatic or cytotoxic effects, and not indirectly through mechanisms such as biological response modification. Suitable \n\n\nchemotherapeutic agents according to the invention are preferably natural or synthetic chemical compounds, but biological molecules, such as proteins, polypeptides etc. are not expressively excluded. There are large numbers of anti-neoplastic agents available in commercial use, in clinical evaluation and in pre-clinical development, which could be included in the present invention for treatment of tumors / neoplasia by combination therapy with TNFa and the anti-angiogenic agents as cited above, optionally with other agents such as EGF receptor antagonists.

Said adjunctive agents prevent or reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or operation, or reduce the incidence of infection associated with the administration of myelosuppressive anticancer drugs. Adjunctive agents are well known in the art. The immunotherapeutic agents according to the invention can additionally administered with adjuvants like BCG and immune system stimulators. Furthermore, the compositions may include immunotherapeutic agents or chemotherapeutic agents which contain cytotoxic effective radio labeled isotopes, or other cytotoxic agents, such as a cytotoxic peptides (e.g. cytokines) or cytotoxic drugs and the like. \n\n The term \"pharmaceutical kit\" as used here in preferably refers to a package and, as a rule, instructions for using the reagents in methods to treat cancers or tumors as described herein and especially to treat breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans. A reagent in a kit of this invention is \n\n\ntypically formulated as a therapeutic composition, for example as described herein, and therefore can be in any of a variety of forms suitable for distribution in a kit. Such forms can include a liquid, solution, powder, tablet, suspension and the like formulation for providing the specific compounds or agents for use according to the invention. The formulations, compounds or agents may be provided in separate containers suitable for administration separately according to the present methods, or alternatively may be provided combined in a composition in a single container in the package. The package may contain an amount sufficient for one or more dosages of reagents according to the treatment methods described herein. A kit of this invention also contains \"instruction for use\" of the materials contained in the package. \n\n\n As used herein, the terms \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" and grammatical variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents, are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable physiological effects such as nausea, dizziness, gastric upset and the like. The preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited based on formulation. Typically, such compositions are prepared as injectables either as liquid solutions or suspensions, however, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified. The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein. \n\n\nSuitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition \n\n can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents., pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient. The therapeutic composition of the present invention can include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the \n\n\nacid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide) that are formed with inorganic acids such as. for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine and the \n\n\nlike. Particularly preferred is the HCI salt when used in the preparation of cyclic polypeptide v antagonists. Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary of liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes. Liquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, and water-oil emulsions. \n\n\nTypically, a therapeutically effective amount of an immunotherapeutic agent in the form of a, for example, antibody or antibody fragment or antibody conjugate is an amount such that when administered in physiologically tolerable composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.01 microgram ^g) per milliliter (ml) to about 100 μg/ml\n1\n preferably from about 1 μ /m\\ to about 5 μg/ml and usually about 5 μg/ml. Stated differently the dosage can vary from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations \n\n daily for one or several days. Where the immunotherapeutic agent is in the form of a fragment of a monoclonal antibody or a conjugate, the amount can readily be adjusted based on the mass of the fragment / conjugate relative to the mass of the whole antibody. A preferred plasma concentration in molarity is from about 2 micromolar (μΜ) to about 5 millimolar (mM) and preferably, about 100 μΜ to 1 mM antibody antagonist. A therapeutically effective amount of an agent according of this invention which is a non- immunotherapeutic peptide or a protein polypeptide (e.g. IFN-alpha), or other similarly-sized small molecule, is typically an amount of polypeptide such that when administered in a physiologically tolerable composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.1 microgram ^g) per milliliter (ml) to about 200 μg/ml, preferably from about 1 μg/ml to about 150 μg ml. Based on a polypeptide having a mass of about 500 grams per mole, the preferred plasma concentration in molarity is from about 2 micromolar (μΜ) to about 5 millimolar (mM) and preferably about 100 μΜ to 1 mM polypeptide antagonist. The typical dosage of an active agent, which is a preferably a chemical antagonist or a (chemical) chemotherapeutic agent according to the invention (neither an immunotherapeutic agent nor a non- immunotherapeutic peptide/protein) is 10 mg to 1000 mg, preferably about 20 to 200 mg, and more preferably 50 to 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The preferred dosage of an active agent, which is a preferably a chemical antagonist or a (chemical) chemotherapeutic agent according to the invention (neither an immunotherapeutic agent nor a non-immunotherapeutic peptide/protein) is 0.5 mg to 3000 mg per patient and day, more preferably 10 to 2500 mg per patient and per day, and especially 50 to 1000 mg per patient and per day, or, per kilogram body weight, preferably about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, and more preferably 1 mg to 50 mg/kg, preferably per dosage unit and more preferably per day, or, per square meter of the bodysurface, preferably 0.5 mg to 2000 mg/m\n2\n, more preferably 5 to 1500 mg/m\n2\n, and especially 50 to 1000 mg/m\n2\n, preferably per dosage unit and more preferably per day. \n\n\n The term \"therapeutically effective\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" \n\n refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by overall survival (OS) or progression free survival (PFS), by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR). Alternatively preferably, the efficacy can, for example, can be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR). \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"physiologically functional derivative\" preferably refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable derivative of a compound to be used according to the present invention, for example, an ester or an amide, which upon administration to a mammal is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of the present invention or an active metabolite thereof. Such derivatives are clear to those skilled in the art, without undue experimentation, and with reference to the teaching of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry And Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it teaches physiologically functional derivatives. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"solvate\" preferably refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (in this invention, said Peptide (and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof) and/or a cancer cotherapeutic agent (or a salt or physiologically functional derivative thereof)) and a solvent. Such solvents for the purpose of the invention may not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol and acetic \n\n acid. Preferably the solvent used is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. Examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents include, without limitation, water, ethanol and acetic acid. Preferred examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents are water and/or ethanol. Most preferably the solvent used is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds to be used according to the invention and their preparation is known in the art. If the compound itself is not a salt, it can be easily transferred into a salt by addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or of a pharmaceutically acceptable base. Pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases are known in the art, for example from the literature cited herein. \n\n\nThe compounds to be used according to the invention, preferably including the Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, and/or one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents as defined herein, can generally be administered to the patient in a form and in a way or manner that is known in the art for the respective compounds or class of compounds, for example as described herein or as described in the literature cited herein. \n\n\nThe Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) is preferably applied as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, more preferably the \n\n\npharmacologically acceptable hydrochloride salt, and especially preferably applied as the inner (or internal) salt, which is the compound cyclo-(Arg-Gly- Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) as such. \n\n\nWith regard to the Peptide of the formula cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), the following kinds of writing the name are preferably to be regarded as equivalent: \n\n\n Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-[NMe]Val) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-[NMe]-Val) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) = cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) = cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) = \n\n cRGDfNMeV = c(RGDfNMeV). \n\n\nThe Peptide of the formula cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) is also referred to as Cilengitide, which is the INN (International Non-propriety Name) of said compound. \n\n\nThe Peptide of the formula cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) is also described in EP 0 770 622 A, US 6,001 ,961 , WO 00/15244 and \n\n\nPCT/US07/01446 of the same applicant, the disclosure of which is explicitly incorporated into the instant application by reference. \n\n\nRecent results show that inhibiting integrins, especially ανβ3 and/or ανβ5, commonly expressed in various cancerous cells, can significantly decrease the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and/or ionising radiation of otherwise chemo- or radioresistant cancerous cells and/or can induce an increased sensitivity of cancerous cells towards chemotherapeutic agents and/or ionising radiation. Accordingly, specific integrin ligands, especially integrin ligands specific to α\nν\nβ3 and/or α\nν\nβ\n5\n integrins according to the invention and especially the Peptide of the formula cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof can be successfully applied to improve the efficacy of various cancer cotherapeutic agents. \n\n\nFor example, a phase I clinical study used cilengitide treatment in a dose escalation study on various brain tumors (NABT 9911). In some of the GBM patients in this study, an indication of response was seen. Cilengitide (= cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val), in very marked contrast to most cancer therapeutics currently in use has a very innocuous side effect profile, with no known MTD in humans - and is very well tolerated. \n\n\n In addition to the essentially 100% mortality in GBM patients (2-year survival \n\n rate about 25%), the morbidity from neurological complications also rapidly degrades the quality of life (QOL). \n\n\nFor example, the standard of treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, associating radiotherapy and temozolomide, has only increased the median survival of resected patients by 2.5 months (12.1 -> 14.6 months) compared to radiotherapy alone (Stupp et al., 2005). However, in combination with at least one specific integrin ligand according to the invention, preferably selected from Vitaxin, Abegrin, CNT095 and cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe- Val), more preferably selected from Vitaxin, Abegrin and cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp- DPhe-NMe-Val) and especially preferably cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe- Val), this standard treatment shows significantly improved efficacy with respect to an increased median survival and quality of life. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference. \n\n\nBreast Cancer: \n\n\n The term breast cancer or malignant breast neoplasm is commonly used as the generic name for cancers originating from breast tissue, most commonly from the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers originating from ducts are often referred to as ductal carcinomas; those originating from lobules are often referred to as lobular carcinomas. However, there are many different types of breast cancer, with different stages (spread), aggressiveness, and genetic makeup; survival varies greatly depending on those factors. Breast cancer is about 100 times more common in women than in men, although males tend to have poorer outcomes due to delays in diagnosis. \n\n\nBreast cancer (BRCA) ist the most common cancer in women worldwide, accounting for - 30% of all female cancers. It represents a major public health problem mainly due to its high incidence, excess mortality and therapeutic challenges. More than 1,1 million women are diagnosed with \n\n BRCA each year worldwide, and more than 400.000 succumb to this disease. Approximately 75% of all newly diagnosed patients are women with early stage BRCA. \n\n\nGenerally, treatment options include surgery, drug based therapy, including but not limited to hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, and radiation. \n\n\nSome breast cancers require hormones to grow, such as estrogen and/or progesterone, and have receptors for those hormones. After surgery those cancers are treated with drugs that interfere with those hormones and/or shut off the production of said hormones in the ovaries or elsewhere. Such drugs are generally referred to as hormone antagonists or hormone blockers. \n\n\nHowever, despite surgery and the use of adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy and targeted drugs, such as trastuzumab, many of these patients will die as a result of local or distant recurrence. The 5-year survival rate for metastatic breast cancer is in the range of 25%. \n\n\nAs can be seen from the above, management of BRCA has been difficult and it still is difficult. For example, treatment of early BRCA includes combined modality therapy with surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, \n\n\nchemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biologic/targeted therapy, such as trastuzumab, for most women. Decision-making regarding the use of adjuvant treatment is based on the risk of disease recurrence. According to the St. Gallen criteria the risk of recurrence depends on the nodal status, tumor stage, grade, tumor invasion of lymphatic or blood vessels, HER2 amplification, age and hormone receptor status. \n\n\nFor advanced (metastatic, locally advanced or recurrent) BRCA there is no clearly defined standard of care. Hormonal treatment, various combinations of chemotherapeutic agents and targeted drugs such as trastuzumab and bevacizumab are currently used to treat these patients. As advanced BRCA \n\n is regarded as an potentially incurable disease, treatment is mainly palliative in nature and aims especially at improving quality of life, progression-free and overall survival. \n\n\nHormonal Treatment \n\n\n Hormonal therapy or endocrine therapy is widely accepted as a treatment modality for women with hormone-sensitive, estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) and/or progesterone-receptor positive (PR+) breast cancer (ca. 70%). \n\n\nEspecially for postmenopausal women with limited visceral involvement and metastases mainly in skin, soft-tissue, bone and a limited number of pulmonary metastases endocrine therapy is the first-line treatment of choice. \n\n\nFor premenopausal women a combination of GnRH-Analoga and tamoxifen is currently the treatment of choice. Postmenopausal women can be treated with either tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (such as exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole), selective estrogen-receptor modulators (such as \n\n\nfulvestrant) or - in exceptional cases - with gestagenes. First line endocrine treatment is reported to result in remission rates of ~ 30% and median progression-free survival of 6-10 months with aromatase inhibitors being superior to tamoxifen in terms of progression-free survival and remission rates, e.g. by Mouridsen et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 21 , No 1 1 (June 1), 2003: pp 2101-2109, the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application. In contrast thereto, clinical activity of 2nd line endocrine treatment is reported to be far inferior, with remission rates of 10- 20% and median time to progression of only 3-6 months, e.g. by Buzdar et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 19, No 14 (July 15), 2001 : pp 3357- 3366, the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application. \n\n\nAll women receiving hormonal treatment for advanced disease will eventually develop hormone-resistant disease requiring chemotherapeutic treatment. Chemotherapy is generally associated with substantial systemic toxicity compared to endocrine treatment, therefore new treatment options \n\n T EP2011/003429 \n\n\n- 53 - prolonging the time to first chemotherapy and improving overall survival are highly warranted. \n\n\nChemotherapy \n\n\n Chemotherapy is indicated for women with advanced BRCA with either ER- and PR-negative disease or women, who have progressed on one or several lines of prior endocrine treatment. In principal, chemotherapy can be administered as mono- or polychemotherapy including two or more drug combinations. \n\n\nFor women with slow or moderate progression of disease monotherapy is preferably indicated. For women with poor prognosis, rapid progression or extended visceral involvement with a high medical need for fast remission, polychemotherapy should be considered. The most commonly used drugs include anthrazyklines, especially liposomal anthrazyklines, taxanes, vinorelbine, capecitabine, mitoxantron, gemcitabine and/or platinum- derivates. Remission rates and time to progression for monotherapy with taxanes in the 1st line setting are reported to be in the range of 20-30 % and 3-6 months, respectively, e.g. by Jones et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 23, No 24 (August 20), 2005: pp 5542-5551), the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application. For polychemotherapy reported remission rates are higher (50-70%), however these do not necessarily improve progression-free and overall survival as compared to monotherapy. In general, polychemotherapy is associated with higher hematologic and non- hematologic toxicity. \n\n\nHER2-targeting drugs \n\n\n Women with HER2-positive advanced BRCA (determined preferably either by IHC 3+ or FISH analysis) should be treated with HER2-targeting drugs. These include currently monocloncal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, and tyrosinkinase-inhibitors, such as lapatinib. \n\n Trastuzumab, for example, can be administered as monotherapy (remission rate ~ 20%), more often however in combination with chemotherapy, preferably selected from taxanes and vinorelbine. The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy is reported to result in a significant \n\n\nimprovement in progression-free and overall survival compared to \n\n\nchemotherapy alone e.g. by Slamon et al., N Engl J Med, Vol. 344, No. 11 (March 15, 2001) 783-792), the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application. \n\n\n Women with hormone-sensitive, HER2-positive advanced BRCA also benefit, if endocrine therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitors) is combined with trastuzumab (reported e.g. by Kaufmann et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 27, No 33 (November 20), 2009: pp 5529-5537, the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application). Lapatinib is especially indicated for 2nd line treatment in combination with capecitabine. By this combination, median time to progression is reported to be improved by 4 months compared to \n\n\ncapecitabine alone, e.g. by Geyer et al., N Engl J Med 2006;355:2733-43, the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application. \n\n\nAnti-angiogenic treatment \n\n\n Especially for women with HER2-negative disease, bevacizumab has shown to improve progression-free survival when combined with docetaxel \n\n\n(reported, e.g. by Miles et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2008 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition) Vol 26, No 15S (May 20 Supplement), 2008: LBA 011, the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application) or paclitaxel (Miller et al., N Engl J Med \n\n\n2007;357:2666-76, the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application). However, no improvement in overall survival has been shown for the combination treatment so far. Recent data support the activity of bevacizumab regarding improvement on progression-free survival for various drug combinations (reported, e.g. by Robert et al., 2009 ASCO Annual Meeting \n\n\n Abstract No:1005;Citation: J Clin Oncol 27:15s, 2009 (suppl; abstr 1005), the \n\n disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application). \n\n\nAccordingly, development of new drugs and especially new targeted drugs aiming at an improvement in overall survival in women with advanced BRCA is highly needed. \n\n\nSupportive Treatment \n\n\n 70% of women with advanced breast cancer develop bone metastases in the course of their disease. These significantly impact on quality of life and are associated with a high morbidity in the affected women. Most frequent complications are pain, pathologic fractures and cord compression, all potentially leading to immobility. These complications elicit the need for interventions such as surgery and/or radiotherapy. \n\n\nCurrent standard of care for all women with bone metastases are \n\n\nbisphosphonates, which are shown to be able able to reduce the incidence of the above mentioned skeletal-related events. The rather novel monoclonal RANKL-antibody denosumab might be superior to bisphosphonates according to recently published phase III data of Stopeck et al., European Journal of Cancer Supplements, Vol. 7, No 3, September 2009, Page 2„ the disclosure of which is included in its entirety into this application. \n\n\nHowever, there remains a high unmet medical need to reduce morbidity caused by bone metastases, especially in women with advanced BRCA. \n\n\nTreatment alternatives \n\n\n After surgery, low-risk, hormone-sensitive breast cancers may be treated with hormone therapy and radiation alone. Breast cancers without hormone receptors, or which have spread to the lymph nodes, or which express certain genetic characteristics, are higher-risk, and thus are generally treated more aggressively. For example, one standard regimen, popular mainly in the U.S., is the combination of cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin \n\n (Adriamycin), known as CA. Sometimes, a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as CAT. An equivalent treatment, popular mainly in Europe, is the combination of cyclophosphamide with methotrexate and/or fluorouracil (also known as CM, CF or CMF, \n\n\nrespectively). In many cases, radiation is added to the surgical bed to control cancer cells that were missed by the surgery, which usually extends survival. \n\n\nBone Metastases: \n\n\n Cancer metastases to the bone are a major clinical concern that significantly limits the patient's quality of life and life expectancy. Patients with bone metastases frequently have reduced mobility, pain, and bone weakness that predisposes them to pathologic fractures, spinal epidural compression, and bone marrow failure. \n\n\n Bone metastases, preferably also referred to as bone lesions, metastatic lesions or just lesions, are often multiple at the time of diagnosis. In adults, the bone metastases or lesions generally occur in the axial skeleton and other sites with residual red marrow, although the bone metastases or lesions may be found anywhere in the skeletal system. Common sites for bone metastases or lesions are the vertebrae, pelvis, proximal parts of the femur, ribs, proximal part of the humerus, and skull. More than 90% of the bone metastases or lesions are found in this distribution. \n\n\nImaging has an important role in the detection, diagnosis, prognostication, treatment planning, and follow-up monitoring of bone metastases or lesions. The true incidence of bone metastases is the subject of much debate, and it is not fully known. The probability of bone metastasis originating from a primary site can be assessed only by knowing the prevalence of the cancer and its predilection for bone. Therefore, the frequency of bone metastases depends on the prevalence of the cancer in a particular community. The incidence of bone metastases also depends on the source of the data. For example, results from autopsy studies and from bone scintigraphic studies are different for newly diagnosed, established, and end-stage cancers. \n\n\nThe bone microenvironment and the ECM (extracellular matrix) in particular, \n\n play a major role in the preferential metastasis to bone by certain cancers, mainly prostate and breast cancer. Types of cancer that most commonly metastasize to bone include prostate, breast, and lung cancers, although all types of cancer are capable of doing so. \n\n\nAs a metastatic lesion grows in the medullary cavity, the surrounding bone is remodeled by means of either osteoclastic or osteoblastic processes. All are a result of dysregulation of the normal bone remodeling mechanisms, caused by tumor-host cell interactions. Osteoblastic tumors cause an abnormal formation of bone by direct secretion of bone extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and by indirect stimulation of osteoblasts. Osteolytic tumors cause abnormal resorption of bone by proteolytic enzymes and through actions on osteoclasts. Osteolysis can release sequestered growth factors from the ECM, resulting in a cyclical feedback loop that leads to further stimulation of osteoclasts and continued bone resorption. As bone mass is lost, tumors can then continue to proliferate in their place and grow in size. \n\n\nLocal radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and osteoclast activity modulating agents, including bisphosphonates and/or RANK/RANKL/OPG modulators, may be used, depending on the type of the primary tumor. If the cancer has spread to bone in only one spot, radiation may be given to treat the bone. In general, this will relieve the pain and prevent fractures at this site. If cancer has spread to several places in the bones, radiation treatment to all of the sites may not be possible because of limitations in the total amount of radiation that can be given safely. Patients experiencing bone pain should be given pain medication. Bisphosphonates and/or RANK/RANKL/OPG modulators encourage osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis and therefore used for the treatment of cancers that spread to bone. However, generally these \n\n\ntreatments for bone metastasis are palliative. \n\n\nMultiple Myeloma \n\n\n Multiple myeloma, also known as MM, myeloma, plasma cell myeloma, or as Kahler's disease is a cancer of the white blood cells known as plasma cells. \n\n Multiple myeloma is a clonal expansion of terminally differentiated B- lymphocytes (plasma cell), characterized by monoclonal immunglobulins (\"paraprotein\"), oesteolysis, renal dysfunction, and immunodeficiency. \n\n\nMultiple myeloma is the second most prevalent blood cancer (10%) after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It represents approximately 1 % of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. Although the peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is 65 to 70 years of age, recent statistics indicate both increasing incidence and earlier age of onset. \n\n\n Multiple myeloma is generally thought to be incurable, but remissions may be induced by therapeutic strategies including, but not limited to steroids, chemotherapy, thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib and/or stem cell transplants. \n\n\nTreatment for multiple myeloma is focused on disease containment and suppression. If the disease is completely asymptomatic, called smoldering multiple myeloma, (i.e. there is a paraprotein and an abnormal bone marrow population but no end-organ damage), treatment may be deferred. These patients are closely monitored for progression to multiple myeloma. \n\n\nPatients whose multiple myeloma is not stable generally require immediate treatment. Initial treatment choices depend on the severity of the patient's condition (high-risk versus standard-risk based) and on eligibility for stem-cell transplantation. Transplant eligibility is determined by the patient's age and general health. Some patients may have the opportunity to participate in novel clinical trials. \n\n\n Patients who do not qualify for stem-cell transplantation are usually given combination chemotherapy with one of three commonly used regimens. \n\n\nThese include, but are not limited to: \n\n\ni) Melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide (also referred to as MPT), \n\n\nii) Bortezomib (Velcade), melphalan, prednisone (also referred to as VMP), and \n\n\niii) Lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. \n\n The choice depends on the patient's clinical condition and risk status of the disease. Elderly patients or weakened patients, who may not tolerate these therapies, are often prescribed a different drug combination or excerpts from the above discussed regimens, such as melphalan and prednisone only (also referred to as MP). \n\n\n If a patient qualifies for bone-marrow transplant, the hematologist may recommend it as an initial treatment or suggests that other treatments be tried first. Recent studies have shown that survival may be similar whether transplantation occurs early (after initial chemotherapy) or is delayed and performed when the disease first returns (first relapse). The patient's needs and wishes are taken into account when choosing early versus delayed transplantation. Whether transplantation is immediate or delayed, transplant candidates typically begin with four rounds of chemotherapy to kill cancer cells. After the initial chemotherapy treatments, stem cells are collected from the patient's bone marrow. Chemotherapy may then resume for patients who wish to delay transplantation. \n\n\n Autologous stem-cell therapy involves transfusion of the patient's own immature blood cells to replace diseased or damaged marrow. Although stem-cell transplantation cannot cure myeloma, it can prolong survival. \n\n\nPatients who do not respond fully to a first transplant may be offered a second. Patients who achieve a complete or very good response from an initial transplantation are observed or sometimes offered the option of a clinical trial investigating maintenance therapy. A second transplant is reserved as an option in case of relapse. \n\n\nTreatment of Relapsed Myeloma \n\n\n Almost all patients with myeloma eventually relapse. If relapse occurs more than six months after stopping therapy, the initial chemotherapy regimen is usually restarted. Transplantation may be recommended for patients who previously had stem cells collected and preserved. The drugs recommended for relapse vary, depending on its severity. Because myeloma cannot be cured, patients with relapsed disease generally continue on one drug or regimen until relapse or adverse side effects, and then try the next option. \n\n Supportive Treatment \n\n\n In addition to chemotherapy, localized radiotherapy and osteoclast activity modulating agents, including bisphosphonates and/or RANK/RANKL/OPG modulators, may be used for treatment of bone lesions due to multiple myeloma. \n\n\nSCCHN: \n\n\n Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (also referred to as Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck): \n\n\n The annual worldwide incidence of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is estimated at 500,000 patients; in the United States and Europe, 1 18.000 new patients are diagnosed annually. SCCHN is more predominant in males with a male.female ratio of 2:1-4:1. There is a positive relationship between smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and head and neck cancer. Approximately 90% of all head and neck malignancies are of squamous cell histology (SCCHN). Most patients are diagnosed with SCCHN at an age of 50-70 years. \n\n\n A majority of patients (75%) have locally advanced disease at diagnosis. Those patients are mainly treated with radiotherapy and in some cases surgery. Newer strategies such as induction chemotherapy or \n\n\nchemoradiotherapy could provide better survival; however, the 5-year survival rate remains around 30%, and 60% of subjects will experience a loco-regional or distant relapse within 2 years of initial treatment. \n\n\nThe group of subjects with recurrent disease and/or with newly diagnosed distant metastases, e.g. bone metastases, has very heterogeneous disease characteristics. Their median survival time, however, remains around 6-8 months with a poor quality of life. This dismal prognosis has not changed in the past 30 years. \n\n\n The standard chemotherapeutic treatments for recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN include drugs such as methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil (5- FU), and platinum compounds. Promising phase II results with new agents such as taxanes could not be confirmed in phase III studies. Cisplatin is the \n\n most widely used drug for the treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN and, as such, is considered the standard treatment in this indication. Overall, all published randomized trials suggest that cisplatin and 5-FU in combination produced higher response rates compared to single agents and most of the other combinations. In general, combination therapy was associated with higher hematological and non-hematological toxicity. The combination of cisplatin plus 5-FU produced a small but questionable improvement over monotherapy with a median survival of 6 to 8 months. Carboplatin + 5-FU containing regimens are also frequently used because of their better safety profile (lower renal, otologic, neurologic, and \n\n\ngastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin). Response rates and survival are not statistically different from cisplatin-based regimens. Carboplatin is therefore approved for the treatment of SCCHN in several European countries. \n\n\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in nearly all SCCHN. EGFR expression carries a strong prognostic significance, providing the rationale for using EGFR-targeted agents, such as cetuximab (Erbitux®), in this indication (Burtness, JCO 2005; Bourhis, JCO 2006). Erbitux is approved in the U.S. for monotherapy of metastatic disease, and in combination with radiotherapy for unresectable SCCHN, where it has demonstrated a prolongation of survival by 20 months. \n\n\nA phase III trial with the combination of Cis- or Carboplatinum, 5-FU and Erbitux has been demonstrated to significantly prolong the median survival time in patients with locally recurrent/metastatic SCCHN. The observed median survival time of 10.1 months is among the longest ever reported in a phase III trial for these patients. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference. \n\n\nNSCLC: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer \n\n\n Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. About 170,000 new cases of lung cancer and 160,000 deaths due to this disease per year occur in the United States alone. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of \n\n all lung cancers. \n\n\n At the time of diagnosis, approximately 30% of NSCLC patients present with locally advanced, and 40% with metastatic disease, including disease having metastasized to the bone. Surgical results in earlier stages are poor compared to other tumor types (about 40% of recurrence in stages l-ll). In metastatic disease, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice, but survival benefits have been modest, resulting in one-year survival of 40%, and five- year survival of less than 15%. \n\n\n It is commonly accepted that the standard treatment for advanced disease (stage IV and 11 lb with malignant pleural effusion) consists of platin-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy. However, there are many open questions in the management of these patients, such as the role of combination therapy regimen including more than two drugs, non-platinum- based therapies, and new targeted therapeutical approaches. \n\n\nCurrently, response rates of about 20%-30% and median survival times of 6 to 11 months have been observed in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Several chemotherapy combinations are used with comparable efficacy. The combinations of cis-/carboplatin plus vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel are among the regimens most commonly used for first-line therapy of metastatic NSCLC. \n\n\n A phase III trial has been initiated based on the results of a randomized phase II trial in 86 patients treated with cisplatin/vinorelbine plus cetuximab versus cisplatin/ vinorelbine alone. The phase II trial revealed an advantage of the cetuximab combination with regard to overall response rate (53% in the experimental arm and 32% in the control arm [Gatzemeier, ASCO 2003, abstract # 2582]). The phase III trial planned to include 1 00 patients (550 per arm), and was powered to demonstrate an increase in median overall survival from 7 months (standard arm) to 10 months (combination with Erbitux). This study has already finished enrollment, and first results are expected soon. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference. \n\n SCLC: Small Cell Lung Cancer \n\n\n Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15-20% of all lung cancer cases in the world, equating to approximately 80,000 new patients every year. A recent analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database confirmed that in the United States, the proportion of small cell lung cancer patients has decreased from about 20% to 13.8% in 1998, likely due to the implementation of smoking cessation programs. This success, however, is to some extent outweighed by the high and rising prevalence of tobacco smoking in other parts of the world. \n\n\n SCLC is typically disseminated at the time of presentation, with \n\n\napproximately 60% to 70% of patients having disseminated (extensive-stage) disease at presentation. Thus, surgery is rarely an option, and applies only to patients with localized (limited) disease. Relapse and death from SCLC is imminent even in patients who are treated with surgical resection. Without other therapy than surgery, survival was 2 months for patients with extensive- stage SCLC and 3 months for patients with limited-stage SCLC (Green, Am J Med 1969). \n\n\n Systemic combination chemotherapy remains the mainstay of SCLC treatment, both in limited and extensive stage of their disease. For more than 20 years, etoposide and cis-/carboplatin are considered the current standard agents used in combination for the first-line treatment of patients with SCLC in the Western world. Combination therapy with more than two drugs in clinical trials has resulted in higher response rates, but also higher toxicity, and did not result in a clinically relevant overall survival benefit. A \n\n\ncombination regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine was shwn to be equally effective as the platinum/etoposide combination, but has a more unfavourable toxicity profile due to the inclusion of an anthracycline. In Japan, cisplatin plus irinotecan is used more \n\n\nfrequently for the first-line treatment of SCLC after a Japanese trial has yielded favourable overall survival. Studies in the Western hemisphere, however, were not able to confirm those results, thus, this regimen is not used as widely in that part of the world. \n\n ln extensive stage SCLC, overall response rates to chemotherapy range from 40% to 70%. Time to progression is short, with the majority of patients progressing within 3 months of completing chemotherapy or even within 3-5 months after the start of the chemotherapy. The median survival is 7 to 11 months. Less than 5% of patients survive longer than 2 years. Especially grim is the prognosis for patients that develop bone metastases. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference. \n\n\nThus, even in view of the results achieved within the last years, the prognosis of the patients regarding most cancerous diseases is still very grim. This holds especially true for metastatic cancerous diseases and especially those which already have metastasized to the bone. Thus, there is a need for improved medicaments, therapy methods and treatment regimen. \n\n\nIt is an objective of the instant invention to provide such improved \n\n\nmedicaments, therapy methods and treatment regimens. \n\n\nThus, subject of the instant invention is: \n\n\n [1] A Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, preferably Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val), for use in the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases in humans. \n\n\nA Peptide of the formula Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, preferably Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val), for use in the treatment of breast cancer and/or bone metastases thereof in humans. \n\n\nThe meaning of the term breast cancer is well known and understood in the art and preferably used herein in accordance with the art.

Thus, the treatment of cancer with chemotherapeutic agents generally includes a prolonged exposure to the one or more respective chemotherapeutic agents. Taking into account that most of the chemotherapeutic agents, when applied in an efficient dose, are toxic for the body of the patient, the \n\n\nchemotherapeutic agents (unless they show any or hardly any acute toxicity) are generally applied over a certain, limited time, followed by a time period without the administration of the respective chemotherapeutic agent, during which time the patient's body is allowed to recover from the toxicity of said chemotherapeutic agent, generally, this treatment regimen comprising the application time period of the respective chemotherapeutic agent and the recovery time period after the application of the respective chemotherapeutic agent is repeated one or more times, preferably several times. This kind of regimen is usually referred to by the skilled artisan as \"cycles\", each cycle comprising the application time period of the respective chemotherapeutic agent and the recovery time period after the application of the respective chemotherapeutic agent. The duration of the application time period and/or the recovery time period after the application of the chemotherapeutic are usually depending on the properties of the respective chemotherapeutic agent. Accordingly, different chemotherapeutic agents can have different durations of the application time period and/or the recovery time period after the of the chemotherapeutic. Thus, the length or duration of a cycle can be different for different chemotherapeutic agents. Generally, the length of a cycle is in between one week and 12 weeks, more preferably one week to six \n\n weeks and especially 2 to 4 weeks. Preferably, the dosing of the respective chemotherapeutic agent is given in an amount per cycle, allowing the the physicist to adapt the actual administration to the status of the patient, i.e. whether the amount per cycle is given in one single administration or divided into two or more portions administered at different times within the cycle. In the setting of a combination treatment comprising two or more \n\n\nchemotherapeutic agents, generally two or more cycles (having the same or a different length) run in parallel. If the chemotherapeutic agent is \n\n\nadministered to the patient in two or more portions within one cycle, each portion is preferably given on a different day within said cycle. With respect to each of the chemotherapeutics administered, generally more than one cycle, preferably two or more cycles, even more preferably three or more cycles are applied to the patient, preferably substantially with out a pause. Generally, not more than 24 cycles are applied to the patient substantially without a pause. The application of about six cycles substantially without a pause to the patient for each of the chemotherapeutics administered is generally a standard for of many of the chemotherapeutics described herein. \n\n\nAccordingly, the time period of 2 to 4 weeks referred to herein wherein the platinum containing chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are administered to the patient in an amount of 100 to 1000 mg in one or more portions (within said time period of 2 to 4 weeks) is preferably to be regarded as one cycle. More preferably, the time period or cycle, wherein the platinum containing therapeutic agent is administered is about three weeks (about 21 days). With respect to oxaliplatin, following administration is also preferred: oxaliplatin is preferably administered to the patient in an amount of 50 to 500 mg in one or more portions, preferably one portion, within a time period of about two weeks.

Recent in vitro results show an increase in cell death/deterioriation after combination treatment of lung cancer cell lines, such as A549, H157, H322, H460 and/or H1975, with specific integrin ligands, such as Vitaxin, Abegrin, CNTO95 and cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val), and cancer cotherapeutic agents, such as Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin, Vinblastin, Taxol, Gemcitabine, Gleevec, Iressa, and radiotherapy, preferably external beam radiation and/or fractionated external beam radiation. The results suggest that cancer cotherapeutic agents, such as radiation, can induce expression of relevant integrins in lung cancer cells, and/or that the specific integrin ligand is acting as an amplifier of efficacy, e.g. as a radio amplifier. Moreover, combined application of at least one specific integrin ligand and at least one cancer cotherapeutic agent, preferably radiation, results in significant cell kill and thus reduced survival curves of the respective treated cells considerably. Accordingly, the combinations appear to effectively induce cell death, likely due to apoptosis and/or mitotic cell death, in endothelial cells and tumour cells, especially in lung cancer cells and especially in non-small cell lung cancer cells. The extent of effect may depend on the degree of target expression, i.e. integrin expression.

Accordingly, the invention provides medicaments and methods that can be advantageously used to treat patients associated with one or more of the aforementioned effects or defects. \n\n\nTherefore, subject of the instant invention is the use of a medicament as described herein and/or a method using said medicament for the treatment of patients, wherein the medicament is to be used in the treatment of patients having an increased DNA methylation status, patients showing partial or complete methylation of at least one promotor of at least one MGMT gene and or patients having an abnormal level of MGMT protein, especially an abnormal low level of MGMT protein. Such patients are preferably referred to as \"methylated patients\". \n\n\nThese subjects are explained and discussed in more detail below. \n\n\nMethylation of the DNA-repair gene O\n6\n-methylguanine-DNA \n\n\nmethyltransferase (MGMT), more correctly called O\n6\n-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repair gene or short MGMT repair gene, causes gene silencing. This epigenetic modification has been associated with a favourable prognosis in patients with many different cancer types, such as glioblastoma (GBM), who receive alkylating agents, for example, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds, alkyl sulphonates and other compounds with an alkylating action, preferably selected from nitrosoureas, preferably ACNU, BCNU and CCNU, busulfan, melphalan, carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, carmustine, ifosfamide and lomustine, temozolomide and altretamine, or campthothecin. Accordingly, there is a relationship between MGMT promoter methylation and the survival rate and sensitivity to alkylating agents, such as temozolomide. The MGMT enzyme removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine, the site of a number of \n\n chemotherapy-induced DNA alkylations. These chemotherapy induced alkylations lead to DNA damage in the tumor cells, including DNA double strand breaks and mismatches, which trigger apoptosis and cytotoxicity [5,6]. The MGMT enzyme repairs DNA damage, thus interfering with the \n\n\ntherapeutic effects of chemotherapy alkylating agents [7-10]. Methylation of discrete regions of the MGMT promoter CpG island is associated with silencing of the gene and diminished DNA-repair enzyme activity [11-13]. Previous studies have indicated that 30-40% of GBM patients have \n\n\nmethylated MGMT promoter [1-4]. \n\n\nThe MGMT promoter methylation and thus the methylation status of the MGMT can be advantageously determined using a 2-stage methylation specific PCR analysis on DNA extracted from tumor specimens, such as tumour specimens which have been snap frozen at surgery. The Methylation specific PCR analysis can be easily performed according to methods in the art. Preferably it can be performed by the Method by Hegi et al., NEJM, 2005, 352; 997-1003); the following method has been successfully been used in a Phase III trial assessing the methylation status of a subset of the patients (tissue available): \n\n\nDNA extraction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction \n\n\nGenomic DNA is isolated from one or two paraffin sections of glioblastoma tissue (Ex-Wax DNA Extraction Kit S4530, Chemicon) (proteinase digestion lasted a maximum of six hours). DNA is denatured with sodium hydroxide in a volume of 35 μΙ and subjected to bisulfite treatment in a volume of 360 μΙ (4.4 M sodium bisulfite and 20 mM hydroquinone) for five hours at 55°C and then purified (Wizard DNA Clean-Up System A7280, Promega). \n\n\nUnmethylated cytosine, but not its methylated counterpart, is modified into uracil by the treatment. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is performed in a two-step approach. [Palmisano WA, Divine KK, Saccomanno G, et al. Predicting lung cancer by detecting aberrant promoter \n\n methylation in sputum. Cancer Res 2000;60:5954-8.] \n\n\nThe results can be confirmed in an independent experiment, starting with reisolation of DNA from the tumor. The PCR products are separated on 4 percent agarose gels. The investigators who selected and analyzed the glioblastoma samples are blinded to all clinical information. \n\n\nAlternatively, it can be performed according to the method described by Donson et al. in Journal Pedriatic Blood Cancer, 2006. \n\n\nAccording to Donson et al., the MGMT promoter methylation/methylation status of the MGMT can be advantageously determined according to the following procedure: DNA Extraction and Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction \n\n\nGenomic DNA is isolated from snap frozen tumor obtained at surgery \n\n\n(COMIRB 95-500) and GBM cell-lines using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA methylation patterns in the CpG island of the MGMT gene are determined by methylation specific PCR. This procedure involves chemical modification of unmethylated, but not methylated cytosines to uracil, followed by a nested, twostage PCR [17]. One microgram of DNA is denatured with sodium hydroxide (final cone. 0.3 M) in a volume of 55 ml and subjected to bisulfite treatment in a volume of 610 ml (3.3 M sodium bisulfite and \n\n\n0.5mMhydroquinone) for 16 hr at 55 °C and then purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, Wl). PCR is performed to amplify a 289-bp fragment of the MGMT gene including a portion of the CpG- rich promoter region. The primers recognize the bisulfite-modified template but do not discriminate between methylated and unmethylated alleles. Primer sequences used in the stage 1 amplification of theMGMTgene are as follows: MGMT-stage 1 -Forward, 50-GGATATGTTGGGATAGTT- 30; and MGMT- stage 1 -Reverse, 50-CCAAAAACCCCAAACCC- 30. Master Mix (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). The PCR amplification protocol for stage 1 is as follows: 95 °C \n\n for 10 min, then denature at 95 °C for 30 sec, anneal at 52 °C for 30 sec, extension at 72 °C for 30 sec for 40 cycles followed by a 10min final extension. A25-ml volume is used in all of the PCR reactions. The stage-1 PCR products are diluted 50-fold, and 5 ml of this dilution is subjected to a stage-2 PCR in which primers specific to methylated or unmethylated template are used. Primer sequences for the stage 2 PCR for the \n\n\nunmethylated reaction are MGMT-stage 2-Forward, 50- TTTGTGTTTTGATGTTTGTAGG I I I I I GT-30 and MGMT-stage 2-Reverse, 50-AACTCCACACTCTTCCAAAAACAAAACA- 30 and for the methylated reaction MGMT-stage 2-forward 50-TTTCGACGTTCGTAGGTTTTCGC- 30 and MGMT-stage 2-reverse 50-GCACTCTTCCGAAAACGAAACG- 30. The PCR amplification protocol for stage 2 is as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, then denature at 95 °C for 15 sec, anneal at 62 °C for 15 sec, extension at 72 °C for 15 sec for 40 cycles followed by a 10 min final 72 °C extension. DNA from normal human lymphocytes treated in vitro with SssI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) is used as positive control for methylated alleles of MGMT and untreated DNA from normal lymphocytes is used as negative control for methylated alleles of MGMT. Each PCR reaction (10 ml) is directly loaded onto 4% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV illumination. Statistical Analysis can be performed with methods known in the art, such as the methods by Kaplan-Meier, correlation and statistical significance analyses, for example using the Prism statistical analysisprogram (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). \n\n\nMethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status analysis is performed on snap frozen tissue of the patients. MGMT methylation status can regularly be determined out the tumors. In a part of the patients, the samples tested for MGMT promoter methylation status proved to be partially methylated (Fig. 29 A). None of the samples showed complete methylation. The incomplete methylation observed may be due to tumor heterogeneity, infiltrating peripheral blood lymphocytes and/or vasculature. For comparison purposes, it can be determined whether partial methylation of the tumor MGMT promoter can be responsible for this observation by investigating the \n\n MG T promoter methylation status of 6 GBM cell-lines, including cell-line 145 which is established from a patient who is treated with temozolomide and who's snap frozen tumor is also analyzed in the above study. In four out of the six celllines studied, partial methylation of promoter is observed \n\n\n(Fig. 29 B). The results show that even in pure GBM cell-lines, partial MGMT promoter methylation can exist. \n\n\nFig. 29 A shows the Methylation status of the MGMT promoter in GBM biopsy specimens, as determined by a nested methylation-specific PCR assay. DNA from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) is used as a control for the unmethylated MGMT promoter (U), enzymatically methylated DNA from PBL (MPBL) served as a positive control for the methylated MGMT promoter (M), and water is used as a negative control for the PCR. A 100-bp marker ladder is loaded to estimate molecular size, as shown on the left scale (L). \n\n\nFig. 29 B shows the Methylation status of the MGMTpromoter inGBMcell- lines, as determined by a nested methylation-specific PCR assay. A 100-bp marker ladder is loaded to estimate molecular size, as shown on the left scale (L). \n\n The MGMT analysis technique described above has been employed in the majority of recent studies showing MGMT methylation to be a successful predictor of response to alkylating agents [1-3]. This technique has superseded earlier techniques of enzyme activity measurement after it was demonstrated that MGMT methylation was the main cause of loss of MGMT enzymatic activity in GBM. \n\n\nPatients that are tested as patients showing MGMT methylation or that can be tested as patients showing MGMT methylation, preferably using the above described method, an analog method thereof, or any other method which is equally suitable according to the understanding of the ones skilled in the art, are to be regarded as \"methylated patients\" according to the invention, more preferably as patients having an increased DNA methylation status and/or as patients showing partial or complete methylation of at least one promotor of at least one MGMT gene. They thus belong to the collective of patients that can be especially advantageously treated by the methods of treatment or the medicaments according to the invention. \n\n\nHowever, such techniques, e.g. the method described below, can preferably be used in concordance with the instant invention with respect to the MGMT status. \n\n\nChemotherapeutic efficacy, the ability of chemotherapy to eradicate tumor cells without causing lethal host toxicity, depends on drug selectivity. One class of anticancer drugs, alkylating agents, cause cell death by binding to DNA which structurally distorts the DNA helical structure preventing DNA transcription and translation. In normal cells, the damaging action of alkylating agents can be repaired by cellular DNA repair enzymes, in particular 0\n6\n-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) also known as 0\n6\n-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (AGAT). The level of MGMT varies in \n\n tumor cells, even among tumors of the same type. The gene encoding MGMT is not commonly mutated or deleted. Rather, low levels of MGMT in tumor cells are due to an epigenetic modification; the MGMT promoter region is methylated, thus inhibiting transcription of the MGMT gene and preventing expression of MGMT. \n\n\n Methylation has been shown by several lines of evidence to play a role in gene expression, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and other major biological processes. In eukaryotic cells, methylation of cytosine residues that are immediately 5' to a guanosine, occurs predominantly in cytosine-guanine (CG) poor regions. In contrast, CpG islands remain unmethylated in normal cells, except during X- chromosome inactivation and parental specific imprinting where methylation of 5' regulatory regions can lead to transcriptional repression. Expression of a tumor suppressor gene can also be abolished by de novo DNA methylation of a normally unmethylated CpG. \n\n\n Hypermethylation of genes encoding DNA repair enzymes can serve as markers for predicting the clinical response to certain cancer treatments. Certain chemotherapeutic agents (including alkylating agents for example) inhibit cellular proliferation by cross-linking DNA, resulting in cell death. \n\n\nTreatment efforts with such agents can be thwarted and resistance to such agents develops because DNA repair enzymes remove the cross-linked structures. In view of the deleterious side effects of most chemotherapeutic drugs, and the ineffectiveness of certain drugs for various treatments, it is desirable to predict the clinical response to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. \n\n\n U.S. Pat. No. 6,773,897 discloses methods relating to chemotherapeutic treatment of a cell proliferative disorder. In particular, a method is provided for \"predicting the clinical response to certain types of chemotherapeutic agents\", including specific alkylating agents. The method entails \n\n\ndetermination and comparison of the methylation state of nucleic acid encoding a DNA repair enzyme from a patient in need of treatment with that of a subject not in need of treatment. Any difference is deemed \"predictive\" of \n\n response. The method, however, offers no suggestion of how to improve clinical outcome for any patient with an unfavorable \"prediction\". \n\n\nTemozolomide is an alkylating agent available from Schering Corp. under the trade name of Temodar® in the United States and Temodal® in Europe. Temodar® Capsules for oral administration contain temozolomide, an imidazotetrazine derivative. The chemical name of temozolomide is 3,4- dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,1-d]-as-tetrazine-8-carboxamide (see U. S. Pat. No. 5,260,291). The cytotoxicity of temozolomide or metabolite of it, MTIC, is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA. Alkylation \n\n\n(methylation) occurs mainly at the O\n6\n and N\n7\n positions of guanine. \n\n\nTemodar® (temozolomide) Capsules are currently indicated in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed gliobastoma multiforme as well as refractory anaplastic astrocytoma, i.e. patients at first relapse who have experienced disease progression on a drug regimen containing a nitrosourea and procarbazine. Temodal® is currently approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma showing recurrence or progression after standard therapy. \n\n\nAccording to the invention, alternatively to the method described above, the level of methylation of MGMT gene is assessed by determining the level of MGMT protein in a sample obtained from the patient. The level can be classified as being \"Very Low\" \"Low\", \"Moderate\", or \"High\", preferably as described in more detail below. \n\n\nAssessing whether or not the MGMT gene is methylated can be performed using any method known to one skilled in the art. Techniques useful for detecting methylation of a gene or nucleic acid include, but are not limited to those described by Ahrendt et aL, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 91 :332-339 (1999); Belsinky etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

No. 6, 773,897 issued August 10, 2004; the entire contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference can rapidly assess the methylation status of virtually any group of CpG sites within a CpG island, independent of the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. This assay entails initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite, converting all unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to uracil, and subsequent amplification with primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. MSP requires only small quantities of DNA, is sensitive to 0.1% methylated alleles of a given CpG island locus, and can be performed on DNA extracted from paraffin- embedded samples. MSP eliminates the false positive results inherent to previous PCR-based approaches which relied on differential restriction enzyme cleavage to distinguish methylated from unmethylated DNA. This method is very simple and can be used on small amounts of tissue or a few cells. \n\n\nAn illustrative example of a Western blot assay useful for this embodiment of the invention to measure the level of MGMT protein in patient samples is presented in U.S. Pat.

No. 5,817,514 (supra) by Li et al. for a description of a Western blot assay to determine MGMT level. The level is compared to that expressed by normal lymphocytes known to express MGMT. \n\n\nPatient MGMT protein levels are preferably classified as follows: Very Low = 0-30% of the MGMT expressed by normal lymphocytes; Low = 31-70% of the MGMT expressed by normal lymphocytes; Moderate = 71-90% and High = 91-300% or higher of the MGMT expressed by normal lymphocytes. \n\n\nPatients that are tested as patients having Moderate or less MGMT protein levels or that can be tested as patients having Moderate or less MGMT protein levels, preferably using the above described method, an analog method thereof, or any other method which is equally suitable according to the understanding of the ones skilled in the art in the art, are to be regarded \n\n as \"methylated patients\" according to the invention.

For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases are treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of ανβ3 and ανβ5 integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n=12 rats) and compared to vehicle treated control rats (n=12). In a longitudinal study, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and flat panel volumetric computed tomography (VCT) are used to assess the volume of the soft tissue tumor and osteolysis, respectively, and dynamic contrastenhanced (DCE-) MRI is performed to determine functional parameters of the tumor vasculature reflecting blood volume and blood vessel permeability. In rats treated with cilengitide, VCT and MRI shows that osteolytic lesions and the respective bone metastatic soft tissue tumors progress more slowly than in vehicle treated controls. DCE-MRI indicates a decrease in blood volume and an increase in vessel permeability, and immunohistology reveales increased numbers of immature vessels in cilengitidetreated rats compared to vehicle controls. In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide results in \n\n pronounced anti-resorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that the achieved ανβ3/ανβ5 inhibition is a a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of bone metastases. \n\n\n1. Introduction \n\n\n Bone metastases occur frequently in many human malignancies including breast, prostate, and lung carcinoma. The stimulation of osteoclasts by tumor cells proliferating within the bone marrow is a feature of the pathogenesis of bone metastases, and both the tumor and the bone microenvironment must be considered when strategies for therapy of bone metastases are \n\n\ndeveloped.\n1\n Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast function that have been used over the last decades to treat patients with bone \n\n\nmetastases. However, they do not induce regression of bone metastases. This, together with the adverse effects associated with bisphosphonate therapy such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and renal toxicity, emphasize the urgent need for the development of novel therapies that can be applied alternatively and as combination partners to target bone metastases more effectively. \n\n\n Integrins are a family of 24 transmembrane proteins that integrate \n\n\nextracellular and intracellular activities. Besides their role in promoting physical adhesion, integrin signaling can induce cell spreading, migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation.\n2\n The ανβ3 integrin interacts with several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including vitronectin, fibronectin, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and fibrinogen.\n3, 4\n It is strongly expressed on activated tumor endothelial cells while on resting endothelial cells in non-diseased tissues its expression is generally low.\n5\"7\n In the pathogenesis of bone metastases, osteoclasts too express ανβ3 integrin, and selective ανβ3 inhibitors have been shown to inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in experimental prostate carcinoma bone metastases.\n8\n Furthermore, ανβ3 integrin over expression on tumor cells stimulated metastasis to bone in experimental models ,\n9, 10\n The closely related integrin ανβ5 is also a vitronectin receptor involved in breast cancer cell migration \n\n and invasion, but is less studied in the pathogenesis of bone metastasis, although it is over expressed by osteoclasts and a wide range of cancer cells.\n11 , 12\n Together with ανβ5, ανβ3 integrin recognizes the arginine-glycine- aspartic acid (RGD) peptide sequence of extracellular ligands.\n13\n Cilengitide (EMD 121974) is a cyclic pentapeptide containing the sequence RGDf(N- Me)V with high affinity for ανβ3 and ανβ5, which inhibits ανβ3/ανβ5- dependent cellular processes.\n14\"17\n As cilengitide inhibits ανβ3 and ανβδ integrin from human, bovine and rat origin, it can be appropriately used in both experimental and clinical studies.\n15, 16\n In recent phase II trials for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, cilengitide has shown promising results including indications of anti-tumor activity and a good safety profile.\n13, 19\n Cilengitide has anti-angiogenic activity in model systems, correlating with its inhibition of attachment, migration, sprouting, differentiation, and in the induction of anoikis in those endothelial angiogenic cells whose adhesion and survival is dependent on ανβ3/ανβ5.\n15, 18, 20\n Nevertheless, targeting av integrins for therapy remains contentious, and for some tumors growth is accelerated in mice lacking ανβ3 and ανβ5 while in others, tumor growth and angiogenesis is accelerated by cilengitide.\n21\n' \n22\n In this study, we have used non-invasive imaging techniques to examine the dynamics of metastatic lesion development under therapy with cilengitide. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently used to determine the extent of the osteolysis and the respective soft tissue component of bone metastases. For in vivo imaging of angiogenesis in bone metastases, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) allows assessment of functional parameters associated with blood volume and vessel permeability in these skeletal lesions.\n23\n We recently introduced an in vivo model of experimental breast cancer bone metastasis in which angiogenesis, soft-tissue lesion size and extent of osteolysis can be monitored simultaneously and longitudinally by volumetric CT (VCT), morphologic MRI and DCE-MRI.\n23, 24\n Here we use this model to noninvasively assess the treatment effects of cilengitide inhibiting ανβ3 and ανβ5 integrins in breast cancer bone metastases. \n\n 2. Materials and methods \n\n\n2.1 Cell lines and culture conditions \n\n\n The human estrogen-independent breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 is purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells are cultured routinely in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). All cultures are kept under controlled conditions (humidified atmosphere, 5% C02, 37°C) and passaged 2-3 times a week to keep them in logarithmic growth. \n\n\n2.2 Flow cytometry \n\n\n The integrin expression profile of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells is characterized using flow cytometry. Surface integrin staining on live cells is performed as described with minor modifications.\n25\n Briefly, cells are harvested, rinsed, suspended in PBS-BSA (containing divalent cations), and sequentially incubated with mouse anti- ανβ3 (LM609\n26\n) mouse anti- ανβδ (P1 F6\n27\n; Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), or mouse anti- αν (17E6\n25\n) followed by staining with fluorescinated goat-anti-mouse IgG and propidium iodide (5 pg /ml). Incubations use 10 pg /ml primary antibody concentrations and are for 45 min on ice. Flow cytometry is performed on a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), gating for viable cells, and collecting 10000 events per staining. The mean fluorescence intensity of the integrin staining is normalized using the staining intensity of the second layer reagent as background. \n\n\n2.3 Animal model and therapy application \n\n\n Nude rats (RNU strain) are obtained from Harlan-Winkelmann GmbH \n\n\n(Borchen, Germany) at the age of six weeks and housed in a specific pathogen-free environment in a mini barrier system of the central animal facility. Animals are kept under controlled conditions (21±2°C room \n\n\ntemperature, 60% humidity, 12 h light-dark rhythm) and offered autoclaved food and water ad libitum. Sub-confluent MDAMB- 231 cells are harvested \n\n using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco®; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) counted on a Neubauer's chamber and resuspended in RPMI-1640 to a final concentration of 10\n5\n cells in 200 μΙ. Rats are anesthetized using a mixture of nitrous oxide (1 l/min), oxygen (0.5 l/min) and isoflurane (1.5 vol.%). Arterial branches of the right hind leg are dissected and 10\n5\n cells injected into the superficial epigastric artery as described previously.\n28\n Bone metastases established and are observed exclusively in the femur, tibia and fibula of the right hind leg. 30 days after cancer cell transplantation, rats (n=24) are randomly divided into two groups, one group receiving the cyclic RGD- peptide inhibitor of ανβ3/ανβ5 integrins (cilengitide, EMD 121974\n14, 17\n· \n29\n; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) intraperitoneally five times per week in isotonic saline (75 mg/kg; n=12 rats) and the other, sham-treated group, serving as a control (n=12 rats). The observation period of all animals is 55 days and no rat in the study dies ahead of schedule. \n\n\n2.4 In vivo imaging \n\n\n After the inoculation of cancer cells each rat is imaged at days 30, 35, 45 and 55 using (i) a flat-panel equipped volumetric computed tomograph (Volume CT, Siemens, Germany) and (ii) a 1.5T clinical magnetic resonance scanner (Symphony, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a home-built receive-transmit coil (cylindrical volume resonator with an inner diameter of 83 mm and a usable length of 120 mm). Prior to in vivo imaging with VCT and MRI, rats aree anesthetized with nitrous oxide, oxygen and isoflurane as described above. \n\n\n2.4.1 Volumetric computed tomography \n\n\n VCT imaging is obtained using the following parameters: tube voltage 80kV, tube current 50mA, scan time 51 s, rotation speed 10s, frames per second 120, matrix 512 x 512, and slice thickness 0.2 mm. Image reconstructions are performed using a modified FDK (Feldkamp Davis Kress) cone beam reconstruction algorithm (kernel H80a; Afra, Erlangen, Germany). \n\n 2.4.2 Magnetic resonance imaging \n\n\n T2-weighted imaging is performed using a turbo spin echo sequence \n\n\n(orientation axial, TR 3240 ms, TE 81 ms, matrix 152 x 256, FOV 90 x 53.4 mm\n2\n, slice thickness 1.5 mm, 3 averages, scan time 3 min 40 s). For dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, a saturation recovery turbo flash sequence through the largest diameter of the tumor (orientation axial, TR 373 ms, TE 1.86 ms, matrix 192 x 144, FOV 130 x 97.5 mm, slice thickness 5 mm, measurements 512, averages 1 , scan time 6 min 55 s) is used. After 20 s baseline, 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA (Magnevist; Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) is intravenously infused for a time period of 10 s. \n\n\n2.5 Postprocessing \n\n\n Unenhanced VCT images and MRI-acquired T2-weighted images are analyzed using the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK, Heidelberg, Germany) to determine volumes of osteolytic lesions and soft tissue components, respectively. DCE-MRI acquired data is analyzed using the Dynalab workstation (Mevis Research, Bremen, Germany) according to the two-compartment model of Brix to determine the parameters amplitude A and exchange rate constant kep, as described.\n23, 30\n Briefly, the injected contrast media is distributed in both compartments (intravascular space and extravascular, interstitial space). The accumulation of contrast agent in these compartments over time is characterized by the amplitude A (associated with blood volume), whereas the exchange of contrast agent between the intravascular space and the interstitial space is characterized by the exchange rate constant k\nep\n (associated with vessel permeability). For determination of the respective values of the amplitude A and k\nep\n of bone metastases in our study, a region of interest is placed around the soft tissue component on color maps for A and k\nep\n, respectively, using the Dynalab workstation (Mevis Research, Bremen, Germany). \n\n\n2.6 Histology \n\n\n At the end of the observation period lower limbs of each animal are \n\n amputated and muscular tissue removed. Bones with surrounding soft tissue tumors are stored in 70% ethanol and embedded in a methylmethacrylat- based compound (Technovit® 9100 NEU, Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 5 pm-thick sections are cut (Microm HM340e microtome; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), mounted on SuperFrost Plus microscope slides and dried overnight at 60°C. Additional freshly removed soft tissue tumors are embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT, TissueTec, Sakura, Japan) and stored at - 80°C. 7 pm thick cryosections (obtained on a Leica CM 3050S) are thaw- mounted, fixed in methanol and acetone and washed in PBS. For \n\n\nimmunostaining, the Tech novit®-em bedded sections are incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies in PBS containing 12 % bovine serum albumin. The following primary antibodies are used: rabbit anti-collagen IV polyclonal antibody (1 :50; Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and mouse anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA) polyclonal antibody (1 :400; \n\n\nSigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). After washing in PBS, sections are incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature as follows: Texas Red® dye-conjugated donkey anti rabbit IgG (1 :100; Jackson \n\n\nImmunoresearch, Suffolk, UK) and Cy™2-conjugated goat anti mouse IgG (1 :50, Jackson Immunoresearch, Suffolk, UK). Cryosections are incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: mouse anti-human integrin ανβ3 Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugated monoclonal [LM609] antibody (1 :100; Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany) and mouse monoclonal [P1 F6] antibody to integrin ανβ5 (Phycoerythrin) (1 :100; Abeam, Cambridge, UK). After a nuclear staining step with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) sections are mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, USA). Sections are examined using a Leica microscope (DMRE Bensheim, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (F-view XS; Soft \n\n\nImaging System, Munster, Germany). Mean positive area fractions of SMA and collagen IV (in percent) as well as mean vessel diameters (in pm) are determined from 4 representative animals of each group analyzing 10 fields of view chosen randomly from each rat using Analysis Software (cell\nF\n; \n\n Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Miinster, Germany). Immunostainings for CD 31 (endothelial cells) and collagen IV (basal lamina) on tumor vessels are seen to be strongly positively correlated in soft tissue components of bone metastases (data not shown). \n\n\nFor light microscopical analysis, sections are stained with Mayer's \n\n\nhematoxylin (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and eosin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), mounted using Eukitt mounting medium (O. Kindler, Freiburg, Germany) and analyzed using a microscope (DM LB; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (DFC 320; Leica, Wetzlar, \n\n\nGermany). \n\n\n2.7 Statistical analyses \n\n\n For each animal, volumes of the osteolysis and soft tissue component, amplitude A and exchange rate constant k\nep\n are plotted versus time after tumor cell inoculation (due to technical reasons one animal of the control group can not be evaluated for the amplitude A and k\nep\n). Normalization of the data to the corresponding initial value at day 30 for each animal is performed and changes are expressed in percent. For statistical comparisons of data from non-invasive imaging and histological analysis, the respective values are compared between the control and treatment groups using the two-sided Wilcoxon-Test; p-values <0.05 are considered significant. \n\n\n3. Results \n\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells express ανβδ but only low levels of ανβ3 integrins in vitro. The entire population of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro expresses av integrins as detected by the pan alpha-v reagent 17E6 (Fig. 1A). They show low cell surface expression of ανβ3 integrins by flow cytometry using the standard defining antibodies in the literature (36 % of the cells are gated; median intensity 3 fold background), while staining strongly for ανβ5 integrins (100 % cells gated; median intensity 10 fold \n\n background) (Fig. 1 B, C). MDA-MB-231 also expresses a2, a3, a5, a6, and β1 , β4, but not a4 or β6 chains (data not shown). In situ \n\n\nimmunohistochemistry shows that soft tissue tumors stained strongly and quite uniformly for ανβδ, but has only weak patches of staining for ανβ3 (Fig.1 D, E). \n\n\nTreatment with cilengitide reduces the volume of osteolytic lesions (OL) and soft tissue components (STC) in experimental bone metastases as assessed in vivo with VCT and MRI. Tumor bearing animals are randomly assigned to two groups before therapy is begun at day 30. The mean relative volumes of the osteolytic lesions (OL) and the soft tissue components of bone metastases (STC) increase continuously in untreated rats until the end of the observation time (day 55 post tumor cell injection) compared to the initial values at day 30 after cancer cell injection (Fig. 2A). Mean relative values of the OL volumes have increased by 1.9, 4.5 and 9.7 fold in the control group and by 1.5, 2.4 and 3.5 fold in the treatment group (at days 35, 45 and 55, respectively) when compared to initial values at day 30 (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A). Significant differences between the groups are found at days 45 (p<0.05) and 55 (p<0.01) for the OL (Fig. 2A). The mean volume of STC have increased by 2.3, 10.4 and 22.5 fold in controls at days 35, 45 and 55, respectively (Fig. 2A). The increase in mean relative STC values in bone metastases of the treatment group, however, increases only by 2.2, 4.9 and 6.3 fold for the volume of STC compared to initial values (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3B). Significant differences between the control and on-therapy groups are recorded at days 45 (p<0.05) and 55 (p<0.01 ; Fig. 2A) for the STC. In the treatment group, three rats (25%) show new bone formation under therapy with cilengitide as imaged by VCT (Fig. 3C). This bone formation is confined to the osteolytic lesion and no excessive increase in bone mass beyond the osteolyis is observed. Such a de novo bone formation further confirmed by histology does not occur in control animals. \n\n\nExperimental breast cancer bone metastases treated with cilengitide \n\n reveal changes in DCE-MRI derived parameters for both, relative blood volume, and for vessel permeability. For the mean relative values of the DCE-MRI parameter amplitude A, a significant decrease is found in animals treated with the ανβ3/ανβ5 inhibitor at days 45 (102% of initial value; p<0.05) and 55 (93% of initial value; p<0.05) as compared to controls (day 45, 125% and day 55, 105% of initial values) but not on day 35 post inoculation (106% in controls vs. 97% in treated rats; p>0.05) (Fig. 2B, Fig. 4A). DCE-MRI parameter exchange rate constant k\nep\n also reveales significant differences at day 55 post inoculation with increased values in treated animals (72% of initial value; p<0.05) compared to controls (40% of initial value), but not on days 35 (controls, 86% and treated animals, 69%; p>0.05) or 45 (controls, 63% and treated animals, 88%; p>0.05) (Fig. 2B, Fig. 4B). \n\n\nHistological analysis reveals new bone formation, decreased vessel diameter and reduced co-localization of smooth muscle actin and collagen IV in blood vessels of animals after treatment with cilengitide when compared to untreated controls. In control rats bone metastases contain tumor cells (representing the soft tissue tumor) within areas of bone resorption corresponding to VCT and MR imaging (Fig. 5A). After treatment with cilengitide, newly formed bone is confirmed on hematoxylin/eosin stained sections (Fig. 5B) taken from the proximal tibia of the animal shown in Fig. 3C. Immunofluorescence analysis in control animals reveales irregular vessels with small diameters, indicated by collagen IV staining in the basal lamina of vessels, which are not co-localized with smooth muscle actin (SMA), along with larger vessels showing collagen IV/SMA co-localization (Fig. 5C). After 4 weeks treatment with cilengitide essentially only small and mesh-like vessels are seen, without clear co-localization of SMA and collagen IV (Fig. 5D). Quantification of the immunofluorescent analysis results in significantly decreased mean positive area fractions of SMA \n\n\n(p<0.05) and significantly increased area fractions of collagen IV (p<0.01 ) in treated animals as compared to controls (Fig. 6A). The ratio of SMA and collagen IV (treated rats: 0.60/3.32; control rats: 0.83/2.37) is significantly \n\n decreased in animals after 4 weeks treatment with cilengitide (p<0.01), and the mean vessel diameter in cilengitide-treated bone metastases (6.6 pm) is significantly smaller than in control rats (8.8 pm, p<0.01 ; Fig. 6B). \n\n\n4. Discussion \n\n\n The aim of this study is to assess the effects of the ανβ3/ανβ5 integrin inhibitor cilengitide on breast cancer bone metastases in nude rats \n\n\ntransplanted with human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We use the noninvasive imaging techniques VCT, morphological MRI and DCE-MRI to follow-up longitudinal progression. Our primary findings are that cilengitide treatment, begun a month after tumors are allowed to implant into bone, decreases osteolysis of breast cancer metastases in nude rats and the volume of the soft tissue tumor components. Cilengitide increases \n\n\nintratumoral vascular permeability, reduces the apparent numbers of mature intratumoral vessels, and unexpectedly causes an resumption of bone formation in a quarter of the animals under therapy. We find a significant decrease in osteolysis using VCT during therapy with cilengitide in nude rats. Several studies have reported a decrease of bone resorption in breast cancer bone metastases after inhibition of the integrin ανβ3.\n9, 31 , 32\n However, these groups have used MDA-MB-231 cells engineered and cloned to over express ανβ3 or breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-435 that strongly express this integrin. As the MDA-MB-231 cells we use only express low levels of ανβ3, the anti-resorptive effect observe here may not be primarily due to the inhibition of this integrin on tumor cells, but also of ανβ3 on osteoclasts and on the intratumoral vasculature, and ανβδ integrin on all three \n\n\ncompartments.\n12, 33\n In previous studies osteoclasts which express high levels of the ανβ3 integrin, bind several RGD-containing ECM proteins including vitronectin, osteopontin, and BSP. \n34\n By these interactions, ανβ3 is involved in the regulation of osteoclast activity and the inhibition of this integrin is found to reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.\n35\n Furthermore, as angiogenesis is required for initiation and maintenance of osteoclastic bone resorption, its inhibition by cilengitide might contribute to the observed \n\n decrease of osteolysis we observe after cilengitide treatment. As cilengitide cross reacts with human and rat av integrins the observed effects in our study are due to the inhibition of ανβ3 and ανβδ integrins on both, MDA-MB- 231 as well as on host cells in particular of the vascular and bone \n\n\ncompartments. Which compartments are targeted to produce the effects we report here is under investigation. \n\n\nInterestingly, three animals (25%) treated with cilengitide here show an increase in bone matrix, i.e. new bone formation in the osteolytic lesions, which is not seen in control animals. There are no known therapies in use today for patients suffering from bone metastases, where such an effect is seen. After treatment with bisphosphonates, a sclerotic rim around osteolytic lesions is a common sign for treatment response indicating local bone mineralization, but new bone formation is not seen after this therapy.\n37\n Both integrins, ανβ3 and ανβδ, are expressed by osteoblasts and are associated with osteoblast migration, adhesion and activity.\n38\n We have previously shown in this model of breast cancer bone metastases, that the inhibition of BSP also resulted in decreased bone resorption and new bone formation.\n28, 39\n As BSP binds ανβ3 integrin, the inhibition of either factors, BSP or ανβ3, might result in osteoblastic bone formation via the same pathway.\n40\n However, the exact mechanism inducing bone regrowth must still be elucidated. \n\n\nNot only are there anti-resorptive effects, but also the respective soft tissue components have a lower volume than in the control animals, indicating an anti-tumor effect of Cilengitide. Cilengitide inhibits the growth of several experimental tumors including melanomas and glioblastomas.\n41, 42\n Due to the high expression of ανβ5 and the low expression of ανβ3 of MDA-MB-231 cells, the anti-tumor effect we report here may be a consequence of directly inhibiting ανβ5 on the surface of the breast cancer cells, combined with the anti-angiogenic effects of inhibiting ανβ3 and ανβ5 on the endothelia of tumor vessels.\n15\n This hypothesis, however, is based only on the integrin expression of MDAMB- 231 cells observed in our study, and has to be verified \n\n experimentally in further studies. Chen et al. previously observed that MDA- MB-231 cells expressed ανβ3 and ανβ5 integrins at similar levels suggesting that treatment effects of Cilengitide might vary depending on the expression pattern of the respective cell clone used.\n43\n \n\n\nAnti-angiogenic effects of cilengitide have been described previously in vitro and in vivo.\n15, 18, 41\n · \n4\n In our study, cilengitide treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases results in a decrease of the amplitude A and an increase of the exchage rate constant k\nep\n as assessed by DCE-MRI. These results indicate a decrease in blood volume and an increase of vessel permeability in these skeletal lesions, compatible with an \"antiangiogenic\" effect. In experimental glioblastomas and melanomas, a decrease in tumor vascularization and tumor growth followed treatment with cilengitide.\n21 , 29\n It is generally assumed that the anti-angiogenic activity of cilengitide and related inhibitors is due to the experimentally observable inhibition of sprouting and differentiation, and the induction of anoikis of angiogenic endothelial cells relaying on ανβ3 and ανβ5 for adhesion and survival.\n15, 45\n In our \n\n\nimmunohistology analysis we observe vessel remodeling after cilengitide treatment including significantly decreased mean vessel diameter and SMA/collagen IV ratio, indicating that smaller vessels lacking pericyte and smooth muscle cells occur more frequently in these animals than in untreated controls. These results of vessel remodeling rather than complete regression of tumor vessels upon cilengitide treatment are in good agreement with the moderate changes of DCE-MRI parameters A and k\nep\n. Taken together, we conclude that cilengitide triggeres a decrease in blood volume (assessed by the amplitude A) due to smaller and partly non-functional blood vessels, and increased vessel permeability (assessed by the exchange rate constant k\nep\n) is observed due to the increased number of immature vessels that arose after treatment with cilengitide. Increased vessel permeability as seen in our study was previously reported by Alghisi and colleagues, who reported VE- cadherin delocalization from cell-cell contact sites on cilengitide treatment leading to a loss of cellular contacts and an increase of endothelial \n\n monolayer permeability In bone metastases, this effect might improve local drug delivery to these lesions when combining cilengitide with standard treatments such as bisphosphonates or chemotherapy. In comparison to bisphosphonates showing predominantly anti-osteoclastic and chemotherapy exhibiting mainly cytotoxic effects in bone metastases, cilengitide shows anti- resorptive, anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic efficacy in our study. Due to the favorable safety profile of this drug and the alternative mechanism of action compared to currently used treatments, cilengitide emerges as a promising novel therapy for breast cancer metastasis to bone and could be validated either as a single agent, or in combination with bisphosphonates and chemotherapy in further experimental and clinical studies. Cilengitide might also be a suitable combination partner for ionizing radiation in the treatment of skeletal lesions due to its previously reported radio sensitizing effects in various tumors including breast cancer.\n47\"49\n In some rodent tumor models, a lack of ανβ3 and ανβ5 integrins, or an inhibition by low concentrations of cilengitide stimulate tumor growth.\n50, 51\n This appears not to be the case in the breast-tumor-to-bone model we report here. Whether one or other of these experimental contexts better reflects the response of human pathologies to av integrin inhibitors, however, must remain to be proven by clinical trial.\n19\n In conclusion, treatment of well established experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide results in an inhibition of bone resorption and soft tissue tumor growth in these osseous lesions and partial regrowth of bone. Although further experimental and clinical studies are required, cilengitide is a possible option for breast cancer patients suffering from metastases to bone. \n\n\n5. References \n\n\n 1. Guise TA.

After 14 days, cilengitide (4 mg/kg) is given as an intraperitoneal bolus in PBS, at various time (8h, 4h, 2h, 1h) prior to a single treatment with single, collimated, dorsal- ventral beam of 6 MV x-rays, so that 95-100% of the central axis dose of 25 Gy hit the tumor volume (Kim et al., 1999). Each of the 7 subsequent days the animals also received an identical i.p. bolus of cilengitide. The animals are maintained under ad libitum food and drink until they become moribund, \n\n or are sampled for tissue analysis (in the t-4 and t-8 h groups, where the animals are healthy past 230 days post tumor injection). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve is calculated and plotted (Fig.7) from the raw data (Table 2). All animals in the RT monotherapy group died by 120 d. \n\n\nReference List: \n\n\nEngebraaten.O., Hjortland.G.O., Hirschberg.H., and Fodstad.O. (1999).

NEJM 2005). In addition Cilengitide (500 mg i.v., 2x/week) was started one week before TMZ RT and given throughout for the duration of chemotherapy or until progression. Primary endpoint was progression free survival rate at 6 months (target: 65%). Patients were followed with MRI every 2 months. Histopathologic diagnosis and MRI imaging were independently reviewed, MGMT promotor methylation status was assessed in 45 (86.5%) pts. \n\n Results: Forty-six pts (92%) completed RT, > 90% of concomitant TMZ was received by 42 pts and cilengitide by 45 pts. 20 pts (3 ongoing) completed 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ and cilengitide. Observed haematological grade 3 and 4 toxicity was: lymphopenia (28/52, 53.8%), thrombocytopenia (7/52 pt. 13.4%) and neutropenia (5/52, 9.6%). Treatment related non-hematologic grade 3 toxicities were reported for n=3/52 (5.7%) patients: constitutional symptoms (asthenia, fatigue, anorexia, n=3); elevated liver function tests (n=1), deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (n=1). One patient with a history of sigmoid diverticulosis experienced sigmoid perforation (grade 2). In total, 34/52 (65.4% [95% CI, 50.9-78.0%]) of the patients were progression free at 6 months. Pts with O\n6\n-Methylguanine-DNA \n\n\nmethyltransferase (MGMT) gene-promotor methylation in the tumor were more likely to reach 6 months PFS endpoint. In total, 34/52 (65.4% [95% CI, 50.9-78.0%]) of the pts were progression free at 6 months. A major \n\n\ncontribution to the overall result was provided by a subgroup of patients (23/52 subjects, with methylated MGMT promoter, silencing the DNA repair enzyme MGMT), which showed a strong increase of the PFS-6 rate \n\n\ncompared to historical control (91 % vs. 69%). The other major subgroup (22/52, unmethylated MGMT promotor) showed a less relevant difference to the historical control (40.9% vs. 40%), which is likely to be significantly improved by a higher dosing of Cilengitide in comparison to the subgroup with methylated MGMT promoter. Overall the study reached its primary endpoint (PFS-6 = 65.4%) \n\n\nConclusion: The study reached its primary endpoint. The combination of the integrin inhibitor RGD peptide Cilengitide and TMZ/RT was well tolerated, PFS at 6 months is very advantagous. MGMT gene promotor methylation provides for even better prognosis. The results are summarized in Figure 8. \n\n\nExample 4: Proliferation Assays \n\n\n 1 Materials and methods \n\n\n 1.1 Test system (biological materials/animals) \n\n Carcinoma cell lines are grown in the following media: \n\n\nA549 -DMEM containing 10% FCS (heat -inactivated) plus 2 mM glutamine, HUVEC-DMEM containing 10% FCS (heat -inactivated) plus 2 mMglutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. \n\n\n All media contains 100 units/ml penicillin \n\n\nand 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells are passaged at confluence by washing once in \n\n\ncation -free PBS followed by a 3 minute incubation in trypsin (0.5 \n\n\nug/ml)/EDTA (0.2 ug/ml) solution in PBS at 37°C. Cells are recovered in medium, centrifuged and taken up in medium and counted. \n\n\n1.2 Chemicals and solutions \n\n\n All cell culture reagents are from GIBCO/lnVitrogen with the exception of foetal calf \n\n\nserum which is purchased from BioWhittaker. Dulbecco's PBS with and without cations is from GIBCO/lnvitrogen Alamar Blue is from Serotech. Paclitaxel, vinblastin, and oxaliplatin are from Sigma. Cisplatin is purchased from Fluka. Gemcitabine is purchased from LGC Promochem, Heidelberg. Gefitnib from AstraZeneca and imatinib from Novartis are commercially available. \n\n\n Cilengitide by Merck KGaA. Bovine serum albimun is from VWR. The extracellular matrix components vitronectin and fibronectin are purified from human serum in house according to SOP 6456; fibrinogen according to SOP 6460. Rat tail collagen I is from Serva. Antibodies for FACS analysis: 17E6, 20H9, LM609, P1F6, 11D1 , P4C10, MAb P1D6 are are commercially available, e.g. purchased from Chemicon. Goat anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate is from Becton Dickson. 1.3 Methods \n\n\n FACS Analysis \n\n\nCells are harvested with trypsin as described above. The required number of \n\n cells is taken up in PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCI2 and 0.5 mM MgCI2+ 0.5% BSA (= FACS Buffer)and aliquoted 1 x10e6 /tube. After centrifugation at 800 x g for 4 minutes, the cells are incubated 60 minutes on ice with anti-integrin antibodies at 10 ug/ml in FACS Buffer, 100 ul/tube. After washing to remove unbound antibody, the cells are incubated with goat anti-mouse FITC diluted 1:25 in FACS Buffer. Cells are incubated 30 minutes on ice, washed to remove unbound antibody and a final cell suspension is made in FACS Buffer 500 ul/tube. Cells are analyzed on a FACScan and the mean intensity fluorescence (MIF) is normalized to the MIF of the negative control (no primary antibody). \n\n\nAttachment Assay \n\n\n Attachment to extracellular matrix proteins is performed as follows: \n\n\nBriefly, 2.5 x 10e4 cells/well in RPMI containing 0.5% BSA and 25 mM Hepes pH 7.4 attached to non-tissue culture treated 96-well plates coated with serially diluted vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen and collagen I for 60 minutes at 37°C. After washing to remove unbound cells the relative cell number is determined by incubation with hexosaminidase substrate. The colormetric reaction is read at 405 nm in a Genios plate reader (SLT). \n\n\nProliferation assay Non-tissue cultures treated 96 well plates are coated using 100 ul/well of a 2 ug/ml vitronectin solution in PBS incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells are plated at 5x10e3 in 100 ul cell culture medium (as described above for each cell line). After 3 hours at 37°C serially diluted chemotherapeutic agents are added alone or in the presence of a constant EC50 concentration of alpha V integrin blocker at two-fold concentration in 100ul/well in cell culture medium. Plates are incubated for 72 hours, after which relative cell number is determined by the addition of 20ul/well Alamar Blue (Resazurin) (Nakayama etal. 1997). After 4 hours of incubation at 37°C relative fluorescent intensity is read in a Genios plate reader (SLT) at \n\n\n535/590nm (excitation/emission). \n\n\n1.4 Experimental design \n\n\n Points are run in triplicate. Reagent blanks, containing media plus colormetric reagent without cells, are run on each plate. Blank values are subtracted \n\n from test values and are routinely 5-10 % of uninhibited control values. \n\n\nIn FACS analysis 15,000 events analyzed. Single cells are gated out from debris and aggregates and the live cells based on staining with propidium iodide. Markers are set on a negative control population stained with goat anti-mouse FITC alone (no primary antibody). Cells that fell to the right of the marker (higher intensity fluorescence) are considered positively stained. \n\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, respectively. \n\n\nConcentration on X-Axis) refers to the respective compound (oxaliplatin, cisplatin, vinblastine, paclitaxel, Iressa (gefitinib) or gemcitabine). \n\n\nY-Axis refers to the relative cell number. \n\n\n Cilengitide concentration is constant (6nM for NSCLC (A549) and 0.2 nM for Endothelial Cells (HUVEC), respectively). \n\n\nResults shown in Figures 11 and 12: Effect of alpha-V integrin inhibitors in combination with vinorelbine on the proliferation of human \n\n\ncarcinoma cells \n\n\n The effect of integrin alpha V blocker EMD 121974 (Cilengitide) on the viability of human carcinoma cells were tested, in combination with \n\n\nvinorelbine and paclitaxel, respectively, in a cell viability assay, dependent on reduction of Alamar blue dye. Each agent alone could inhibiting carcinoma viability, used together the compounds show an advantagous and preferably synergistic inhibitory effect. \n\n\n5.1 Test System (Biological Materials/Animals) \n\n\n5.2 Chemicals and Solutions \n\n\n Cilengitide, EMD 121974, cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe[N-Me]-Val) was synthesized, purified and characterized in house [23]. Cilengitide was stored in sterile apyrogenic solution at 4 °C. \n\n\n Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (136.9 mM NaCI, 2.8 mM KCI, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHP0 » H20, 1.5 mM KH\n2\nP0\n4\n) without calcium and magnesium, \n\n trypsin /EDTA and Medium 199 were from Life Technologies, and other reagents as follows: serum albumin (bovine Fraction V) (VWR); Alamar Blue (Serotec); chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel, docetaxel, etoposide, and vinorelbine are commercially available. Chemotherapeutic compounds were dissolved in DMSO as stock solutions at 10 mM, stored at 4°C and used within one month. \n\n\n5.3 Methods \n\n\n The methods established and described in detail previously (Goodman and Hahn a; b) were used to measure the effect of combinations of integrin inhibitors and chemotherapeutics on carcinoma cell and human endothelial cell proliferation. \n\n\n5.4 Experimental Design \n\n\n Points were run in duplicate or in triplicate. Reagent blanks, containing media plus Alamar Blue without cells, were run on each plate. Blank values were subtracted from test values and were routinely 5-10 % of uninhibited control values. \n\n\n In the growth assay Cilengitide was tested in the range of 50 μΜ to 0.1 nM. In the Constant Ratio Combination Assay substances were tested at 8-fold, 4-fold, 2-fold 1-fold 0.5-fold and 0.25-fold of the respective EC\n5\no \n\n\nconcentration. \n\n\n5.5 Methods of Evaluation and Statistics \n\n\n Chemotherapeutic agents and av-integrin blockers were serially diluted alone or together (combination therapy). In some assays the chemotherapeutic agent was serially diluted alone or in combination with of alpha-v integrin blocker. Growth inhibition curves were plotted and a shift of the combination therapy curve to lower concentrations in relation to the single agent curves was interpreted as an additional effect, produced by combination versus monotherapy. \n\n5.6 Results \n\n\n The av -integrin competitive inhibitor Cilengitide (EMD 121974) was tested alone and in combination with vinorelbine in a serum growth stimulation assay using human carcinoma cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In these assays cells are cultured in serum, or in an endothelial growth stimulation medium (Goodman & Hahn). \n\n\nAs monotherapies, the chemotherapeutics inhibited the growth of both endothelial and carcinoma cells. \n\n\n The alpha -v integrin blockers inhibited endothelial cell growth. A typical result using HUVEC is shown in Fig 1, where the IC50 for Cilengitide was 700 nM. For Paclitaxel the IC\n50\n of 10 nM was reduced to 0.05 nM in combination with 2 μΜ Cilengitide. For vinorelbine, the IC50 of 20 nM was reduced to 0.8 nM in combination with 2 μΜ Cilengitide. \n\n\n Growth of cancer cell lines derived from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC: A549, renal carcinoma (A498), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN: Detroit 562) were also inhibited by the \n\n\nchemotherapeutics, and specifically by vinorelbine, and in all cases this inhibition was advantagously and preferably synergistically enhanced by the presence of cilengitide. \n\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of the vinorelbine with integrin inhibitors at their EC50 concentrations lowered the EC\n50\n for these cytotoxics dramatically, preferably at least 5-fold, more preferably at least 10-fold, or even more. As the therapeutic window for such drugs is often extremely narrow, this reduction in EC50 appears to be a very valuable addition to the anti-cancer drug battery allowing more prolonged and less aggressive, yet more efficacious therapy regimens to be pursued. The results of these assays or assays performed in an analogous or essentially analogous manner are preferably summarized in Figures 9, 10, 1 ,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and/or 27, respectively. Amendments or comments to the assays/results are preferably highlighted in the respective Examples 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and/or 17 and the corresponding Figures as given \n\n below. \n\n\n5.7 References \n\n\n 1.

The respective Combination Index (CI) Docetaxel - Cilengitide (CI = 0.7) and Paclitaxel - Cilengitide (CI = 0.1) indicates the synergistic effect of the combinations. (See Figure 15). \n\n\nExample 7: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with paclitaxel on NSCLC cell proliferation \n\n\n Figure 16 shows A549 Constant Ratio Proliferation Assay. Cells grew on vitronectin-coated plates for 72 hours in the presence of a serially diluted chemotherapeutic with (triangles) or without (squares) Cilengitide. For the combination treatment the drugs were mixed at eight-fold the respective EC50 concentrations and the mixture was a serially diluted. Relative cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction and shows the synergistic effect of the combination of paclitaxel and Cilengitide on the cell grow. The respective Combination Index (CI) Paclitaxel - Cilengitide (CI = 0.33) indicates the synergistic effect of the combination. \n\n\nExample 8: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with bleomycin/oxaliplatin/paclitaxel on A549 NSCLC cell proliferation\n\n\nA549 NSCLC assay with bleomycin/oxaliplatin/paclitaxel and Cilengitide ananlysed according to Chou and Talalay [1] shows synergistic effect in all graphs shown in Figure 15. The respective Combination Index (CI) \n\n\nBleomycin - Cilengitide (CI = 0.07), Oxaliplatin - Cilengitide (CI = 0.66) and Paclitaxel - Cilengitide (CI = 0.33) indicates the synergistic effect of the combinations. (See Figure 17). \n\n\nExample 9: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with Paxlitaxel or Vinblastine on various NSCLC cell lines \n\n\n Calu6 NSCLC assay with paclitaxel and Cilengitide and H460 NSCLC assay with vinblastine/paclitaxel and Cilengitide show synergistic effects in all graphs shown in Figure 18. \n\n Example 10: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with 5-FU or Paclitaxel on various EGFR dependent cell lines \n\n\n Both the combinations of 5-FU with Cilengitide and Paclitaxel with Cilengitide show an advantagous and preferably synergistic effect in EGFR dependent cancers, as is shown by the results in Figure 9, e.g. in the ACHN, A498 and Caki 1 cell proliferation assays. \n\n\nExample 11 : Combination efficacy of Cilengitide & Erbitux in carcinoma xenograft, optionally in combination with Radiotherapy \n\n\n This example shows that combined treatment with integrin ligand Cilengitide, a potent antagonist of ανβ3, and EGFR antibody Cetuximab (Erbitux), optionally combined with Radiotherapy (preferably also referred to as RT, Rx or RTx), preferably external beam radiotherapy, are beneficial, and especially synergistically beneficial, in local tumor therapy. The results of the in vivo xenograft experiments show that radiation up-regulates ανβ3 expression in endothelial cells and consecutively phosphorylates Akt, whichmay provide a tumor escape mechanism from radiation injury mediated by integrin survival signaling. The studies on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, apoptosis, and clonogenic survival also show that the \n\n\nradiosensitivity of endothelial cells is enhanced by the concurrent \n\n\nadministration of the integrin antagonist. It can be shown that promissing in vitro data (shown in Figure 22) can be successfully translated into human xenograft modells, e.g. the epidermoid (A431), xenograft model growing s.c. on BALB/c-nu/nu mice as shown in Figure 20 and Figure 21. Suitable reagents and methods for these experiments are known in the art. \n\n\nThe experiments are preferably carried out as described below or in an analogous manner thereof: \n\n\nReagents and cell culture. Primary isolated HUVECs and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC; Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) are cultured up to passage 5. Cells are maintained in culture at 37jC with 5% \n\n C02 and 95% humidity in serum reduced (5% FCS) modified Promocell medium supplemented with 2 ng/mL VEGF and 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; refs. 1 , 30, 31). Human prostate (PC3), glioma (U87), and vulva (A431) tumor cells (Tumorbank DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany) are cultured in DMEM medium (10% FCS). All experiments are carried out with HUVEC (up to passage 5) and a selection of experiments is confirmed using HDMEC (up to passage 6). \n\n\nMatrigel invasion, migration, and coculture experiments. Invasion of HUVEC and HDMEC in vitro is measured on Matrigel-coated (0.78 mg/mL) transwell inserts with 8 Am pore size (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells are trypsinized and 200 AL of cell suspension (3 _ 105 cells/mL) per experiment are added to transwells in triplicate. Chemoattractant medium containing VEGF and bFGF (500 AL) is added to the lower wells. For coculture studies, PC3 cells are seeded in 24-well plates and, after irradiation of PC3 cells, Matrigel-coated transwells with endothelial cells are added to the upper compartment. After 18 hours of incubation, endothelial cells that have invaded the underside of the membrane are fixed and stained with Diff- Quik II solution (Dade Behring) and sealed on slides. Migrating cells are counted by microscopy. \n\n\nAnimal studies. Animal studies are done according to the rules for care and use of experimental animals and approved by the local and governmental Animal Care Committee instituted by the German government \n\n\n(Regierungspraesidium, Karlsruhe). For tumor growth experiments with s.c. growing human xenotransplants, athymic 8-week-old, 20 g BALB/c-nu/nu mice are obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Human PC3 prostate carcinoma cells, U87 glioblastoma cells, and A431 vulva carcinoma cells are injected s.c. into the right hind limb (1-5 _ 106 cells in 100 AL PBS). Animals are randomized for therapy when tumor volume reaches 200 mm\n3\n as determined thrice weekly by direct measurement with calipers and calculated by the formula volume V = length _ width _ width _ \n\n 0.5. Starting on day 0, the respective drug is administered s.c. as given below. Radiotherapy (5 _ 2.5 Gy) is delivered on 5 consecutive days using a Co-60 source (Siemens, Gammatron, Erlangen, Germany), or as given below.- \n\n\nCombination efficacy of Cilengitide & Erbitux in carcinoma xenograft, optionally in combination with Radiotherapy (Rx) is preferably determined as follows: \n\n\n A431 human epidermoid carcinoma s.c. on balb c nu nu mouse is treated with Erbitux (cetuximab) in an amount of 25 mg/kg (=0.5mg/animal), administered i.p. on day 1 (4h before radiotherapy (Rx), if the optional radiotherapy is also applied), day 8, day 15 and day 22; Cilengitide (cyclo- (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val)) is administered i.p. in an amount of:25 mg/kg 20 times, preferably on 5 consecutive days per week (20x 5/w), preferably 1- 2 h before radiotherapy (Rx), if the optional radiotherapy is also applied. \n\n\nFurther reference, especially with respect to the methodology, is given to the Literature given below, which is included in the disclosure of this application in its entirety by reference: \n\n\nAbdollahi et al., CANCER RESEARCH 63, 8890-8898, December 15, 2003 Abdollahi et al., Cancer Res 2005; 65: (9).

These results are shown in Figure 22. \n\n\nCell proliferation assays were run with A431 , HDMVEC and U87 cell lines, \n\n respectively, with either Erbitux (at a concentration of 2.2 pg/ml) or \n\n\nCilengitide (at a concentration of 100 nM) or both, optionally in combination with radiotherapy (Rx = 2 Gy), against the untreated control or radiotherapy Rx alone. Figure 20 shows the advantageous and preferably synergistic effect of all the combinations and especially of the combination of Erbitux and Cilengitide and the combination of Erbitux, Cilengitide and radiotherapy. \n\n\nExample 13: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and etoposide on HUVEC cell proliferation. These results are shown in Figure 23. \n\n\nHUVEC cells were cultured on vitronectin-coated wells in Medium 199 containing 2% FSC and 10 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and the respective chemotherapeutic agent alone or in combination. Relative cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction. \n\n\nAs is shown by the isobologram in Figure 23, av integrin ligand Cilengitide and etoposide act synergistically to inhibit HUVEC endothelial cell \n\n\nproliferation. The data for the eye isobologram is taken from the graph on top of Figure 23 and is analysed according to Chou and Talalay [1]. Dm = drug concentration at medium effect. The Combination Index (CI) < 1 (here CI = 0.4) indicates synergy for this combination. \n\n\nExample 14: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and the Drugs etoposide, doxorubicine, vincristine or melphalan on HUVEC cell proliferation. These results are shown in Figure 24. \n\n\n HUVEC cells were cultured on vitronectin-coated wells in Medium 199 containing 2% FSC and 10 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and the respective chemotherapeutic agents (Drug) alone or in combination with a constant concentration(ICso or IC70) of \n\n\nCilengitide. Relative cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction. \n\n Example 15: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and the Drugs 5-FU, Cisplatin or Camptothecin on HUVEC cell proliferation. These results are shown in Figure 25. \n\n\n HUVEC cells were cultured on vitronectin-coated wells in Medium 199 containing 2% FSC and 10 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and the respective chemotherapeutic agents (Drug) alone or in combination with a constant concentration(ICso or IC70) of \n\n\nCilengitide. Related cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction. \n\n\nExample 16: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and etoposide on HUVEC cell proliferation. These results are shown in Figure 26. \n\n\n Constant ratio assay with docetaxel/paclitaxel and Cilengitide combinations on HUVEC endothelial cells grown in complete EGM MV medium, analysis according to Chou and Talalay [1] shows synergistic effect in Figure 24 graph and isobologram (CI = 0.2). \n\n\nExample 17: Effect of av integrin ligand Cilengitide and cisplatin or etoposide on SCLC cell proliferation. These results are shown in Figure 27. \n\n\n Constant Ratio Proliferation Assay: DMS 53 SCLC cells were cultured 72 hr in the presence of etoposide or cisplatin alone or in combination with \n\n\nCilengitide at a fixed ratio. Cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction. \n\n\n X-axis shows the concentration of chemotherapeutic agent used. The \n\n\nCilengitide concentration was in a ratio of 0.4:1 for etoposide:Cilengitide and 1 :0.5 for cisplatin:Cilengitide. \n\n\nExample 18: Study 007: MDA-MB-468 - primary tumor growth \n\n\n MDA-MB468 human breast tumour cells were orthotopically inoculated into the third mammary fat pad of female BALB/c nu/nu mice. The mice were randomised into groups when the tumors reached a size of approximately 40 \n\n mm\n3\n. \n\n\n The mice in each group received treatment with either Vehicle Control (Placebo) or EMD 121974 (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) by daily subcutaneous injection. Body weight and tumour volume measurements were made for all mice three times per week. \n\n\n Result: Daily treatment with EMD 121974 inhibited tumor growth of MDA-MB- 468 tumors (tumour volume for all three dosing groups (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) below 200 mm\n3\n on day 60, tumour volume for Vehicle Control higher than 350 mm\n3\n on day 60. Results are shown in detail in Figure 28."
