No. 12/299,381, filed on Nov. 6, 2009, which is a U.S. National phase under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT Application No. PCT/IB2007/001123, filed on Apr. 19, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/746,087, filed May 1, 2006, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel substituted 2-amino-fused heterocyclic compounds, such as 2-amino-quinolines, 2-amino-isoquinolines, and 2-amino-quinazolines, compounds of formula (I), to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, as well as to the use of the compounds in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment or prevention of a disease or medical condition mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), leading to a decreased glucose threshold for insulin secretion. In addition the compounds are predicted to lower blood glucose by increasing hepatic glucose uptake. Such compounds may have utility in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nMammalian cells respond to extracellular stimuli by activating signaling cascades that are mediated by members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, which include the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), also known as stress activated protein kinase (SAPK). Three distinct genes, JNK1, JNK2, JNK3 have been identified and at least ten different splicing isoforms of JNKs exist in mammalian cells [Gupta et al., EMBO J., 15:2760-70 (1996)]. While JNK1 and JNK2 express in many tissues, JNK3 specifically expresses in the brain. Thus, JNK3 has a potential to be particularly involved in nervous function. The JNK signal transduction system of stress response MAP kinase family system is activated by changes in osmotic pressure, DNA damage, anisomycine, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, ischemia, inflammatory cytokines and the like and various stress stimulations relating to apoptosis induction, it is considered to constitute a major intracellular information transduction path responsible for stress response (Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, vol. 1333, pp. F85-F104 (1997)). From an experiment using a JNK1 deletion mouse, JNK is reported to be an important mediator involved in obesity and insulin resistance (Nature, vol. 420, pp. 333-336 (2002)).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE

Examples of solvates include compounds of the invention in combination with water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide), ethyl acetate, acetic acid, or ethanolamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, includes salts of acidic or basic groups which may be present in the compounds of formula (I). The compounds of formula (I) that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds of formula (I) are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edislyate, estolate, esylate, ethylsuccinate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phospate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodode, and valerate salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diseases in which the liver is a target organ”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated means diabetes, hepatitis, liver cancer, liver fibrosis, and malaria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Metabolic syndrome”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated means psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, wound healing, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease, phenylketonuria, hypersarcosinemia, thymine uraciluria, sulfinuria, isovaleric acidemia, saccharopinuria, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds of formula (I), where terms such as (CR\n5\nR\n6\n)\nv \nor (CR\n8\nR\n9\n)\np \nare used, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \nmay vary with each iteration of v or p. For instance, where v or p is 2 the terms (CR\n5\nR\n6\n)\nv \nor (CR\n8\nR\n9\n)\np \nmay equal —CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, or —CH(CH\n3\n)C(CH\n2\nCH\n3\n)(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n3\n)—, or any number of similar moieties falling within the scope of the definitions of R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treating”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term “treatment”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of treating as “treating” is defined immediately above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “modulate” or “modulating”, as used herein, refers to the ability of a modulator for a member of the steroid/thyroid superfamily to either directly (by binding to the receptor as a ligand) or indirectly (as a precursor for a ligand or an inducer which promotes production of ligand from a precursor) induce expression of gene(s) maintained under hormone expression control, or to repress expression of gene(s) maintained under such control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “obesity” or “obese”, as used herein, refers generally to individuals who are at least about 20-30% over the average weight for his/her age, sex and height. Technically, “obese” is defined, for males, as individuals whose body mass index is greater than 27.8 kg/m\n2\n, and for females, as individuals whose body mass index is greater than 27.3 kg/m\n2\n. Those of skill in the art readily recognize that the invention method is not limited to those who fall within the above criteria. Indeed, the method of the invention can also be advantageously practiced by individuals who fall outside of these traditional criteria, for example, by those who may be prone to obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “inflammatory disorders”, as used herein, refers to disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, chondrocalcinosis, gout, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and cachexia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “therapeutically effective amount”, as used herein, refers to that amount of drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal, or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “amount . . . effective to lower blood glucose levels”, as used herein, refers to levels of compound sufficient to provide circulating concentrations high enough to accomplish the desired effect. Such a concentration typically falls in the range of about 10 nM up to 2 μM; with concentrations in the range of about 100 nM up to 500 nM being preferred. As noted previously, since the activity of different compounds which fall within the definition of Formula (I) as set forth above may vary considerably, and since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms, it is up to the practitioner to determine a subject's response to treatment and vary the dosages accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “insulin resistance”, as used herein, refers to the reduced sensitivity to the actions of insulin in the whole body or individual tissues, such as skeletal muscle tissue, myocardial tissue, fat tissue or liver tissue. Insulin resistance occurs in many individuals with or without diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “insulin resistance syndrome”, as used herein, refers to the cluster of manifestations that include insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, and dyslipidemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of formula (I) may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I), and mixtures thereof, are considered to be within the scope of the invention. With respect to the compounds of formula (I), the invention includes the use of a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, or mixtures thereof. The compounds of formula (I) may also exist as tautomers. This invention relates to the use of all such tautomers and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain functional groups contained within the compounds of the present invention can be substituted for bioisosteric groups, that is, groups which have similar spatial or electronic requirements to the parent group, but exhibit differing or improved physicochemical or other properties. Suitable examples are well known to those of skill in the art, and include, but are not limited to moieties described in Patini et al., Chem. Rev, 1996, 96, 3147-3176 and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject invention also includes isotopically-labelled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said compounds which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances.

These chemical manipulations are known to those skilled in the art and include a) removal of a protecting group by methods outlined in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991; b) displacement of a leaving group (halide, mesylate, tosylate, etc) with a primary or secondary amine, thiol or alcohol to form a secondary or tertiary amine, thioether or ether, respectively; c) treatment of phenyl (or substituted phenyl) carbamates with primary of secondary amines to form the corresponding ureas as in Thavonekham, B et. al.

Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixtures into a diastereomric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and pure enantiomers are considered as part of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formulas (I) that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of formula (I) from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose compounds of formula (I) that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of formula (I). Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of other metabolic disorders associated with impaired glucose utilization and insulin resistance include major late-stage complications of NIDDM, such as diabetic angiopathy, atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic ocular complications such as retinopathy, cataract formation and glaucoma, and many other conditions linked to NIDDM, including dyslipidemia glucocorticoid induced insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, polycysitic ovarian syndrome, obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension. Brief definitions of these conditions are available in any medical dictionary, for instance, \nStedman's Medical Dictionary \n(Xth Ed.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical Compositions/Formulations, Dosaging and Modes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with formulation and administration techniques. Such topics would be discussed, e.g. in Goodman and Gilman's \nThe Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics\n, current edition, Pergamon Press; and \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, current edition. Mack Publishing, Co., Easton, Pa. These techniques can be employed in appropriate aspects and embodiments of the methods and compositions described herein. The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to serve as limitations of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino heterocyclyl compounds of formula (I) may be provided in suitable topical, oral and parenteral pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment of GK mediated diseases. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally as tablets or capsules, as oily or aqueous suspensions, lozenges, troches, powders, granules, emulsions, syrups or elixirs. The compositions for oral use may include one or more agents for flavoring, sweetening, coloring and preserving in order to produce pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets may contain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as an aid in the manufacture of such tablets. As is conventional in the art these tablets may be coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable enteric coating, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract to provide a sustained action over a longer period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions normally contain active ingredients in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of an aqueous suspension. Such excipients may be a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; a dispersing or wetting agent that may be a naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, a condensation product of ethylene oxide and a long chain fatty acid, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, a condensation product of ethylene oxide and a long chain aliphatic alcohol such as heptadecaethylenoxycetanol, a condensation product of ethylene oxide and a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate or a fatty acid hexitol anhydrides such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to know methods using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents that have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be formulated as a suspension in a non toxic perenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino heterocyclyl compounds of formula (I) may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at about 25 Celcius but liquid at rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and other glycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use preparations, for example, creams, ointments, jellies solutions, or suspensions, containing the compounds of the present invention are employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino heterocyclyl compounds of formula (I) may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multimellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipides, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of the compounds of the present invention are of the order of about 0.5 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. A preferred dosage rate is between about 30 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a number of factors including the activity of the particular compound being administered, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. To enhance the therapeutic activity of the present compounds they may be administered concomitantly with other orally active antidiabetic compounds such as the sulfonylureas, for example, tolbutamide and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the compounds of the present invention and methods of preparing such compounds. It is to be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited in any way by the scope of the following examples and preparations. In the following examples molecules with a single chiral center, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture. Those molecules with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers.

Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (PPM, 6) downfield from an internal tetramethylsilane standard. Alternatively, \n1\nH NMR spectra were referenced to signals from residual protons in deuterated solvents as follows: CDCl\n3\n=7.25 ppm; DMSO-d\n6\n=2.49 ppm; C\n6\nD\n6\n=7.16 ppm; CD\n3\nOD=3.30 ppm. Peak multiplicities are designated as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; t, triplet; dt, doublet of triplets; q, quartet; br, broadened; m, multiplet. Coupling constants are given in Hertz (Hz). Mass spectra (MS) data were obtained using Agilent mass spectrometer with APCI or ESI ionization. Elemental microanalyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab Inc. and gave results for the elements stated within ±0.4% of the theoretical values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds in accordance with the invention may be prepared in manners analogous to those specifically described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the compounds of the present invention and methods of preparing such compounds.

Via an addition funnel, slowly charged 25 wt % solution of sodium methoxide (4.64 g, 86 mmol, 19.7 mL) in methanol. (Note: addition is slightly exothermic). The mixture was stirred for 15 h, at which point, the solvent was removed under vacuum (Note: starting material had not been completely converted according to NMR). The residue was dissolved in methanol and charged with a fresh sodium methoxide solution—same concentration/equivalents—and stirred another 15 h). The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (1.0 L), with the organic phase washed with water (3×500 mL), then brine (1×300 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, the salts filtered and the solvent reduced under vacuum to give 89.9 g of a crude mixture of methyl 2,2-diethoxyethanimidoate and un-reacted starting material (10-12 mol % by NMR) as a thin oil. Note that best yields of the imidate are obtained when the organic layer is stripped of at 400 mbar and 45° C. because of its volatility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oil was dissolved in methanol (300 mL,) and placed into a 2 L round bottom flask (equipped with magnetic stir bar, reflux condenser) along with 1-(4-bromophenyl)methanamine (100.0 g, 537 mmol) and the mixture subjected to heating in a pre-heated oil bath. The mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 18 h and then allowed to cool. The solvent was removed to give 158.8 g of the desired intermediate (1) in 93.8% yield (based on 1-(4-bromophenyl)methanamine as limiting reagent).\n\n\n \nPreparation of Intermediate 2: 6-Bromoisoquinolin-3-amine\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a 3 L, three-neck round bottom flask (equipped with magnetic stir bar, thermometer, addition funnel), charged conc. sulfuric acid (1.12 L). While maintaining an internal temperature of 20-25° C. with an ice water bath, dropwise charged N-(4-bromobenzyl)-2,2-diethoxyethanimidamide (158.8 g, 504 mmol). After addition, removed bath and allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 72 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 12-L, 3-necked round bottom flask, equipped with a large stirrer bar, dropping funnel and thermometer was charged with water (5 L). The flask was placed in an IPA bath and cooled externally with solid CO\n2 \nto an internal temperature of 8° C. Over a period of 1¾ h, the reaction mixture was added slowly to the water, keeping the internal temperature between 0° C. and 10° C., resulting in a yellow suspension. With continued cooling, a 12 M NaOH solution was added over a 4 h period, keeping the internal temperature below 30° C. A final pH of 9-10 was reached (required 4.6 L, 12 M NaOH). Note that upon reaching neutral pH, the suspension changed to a much darker yellow. The suspension was filtered over a medium glass filter and the remaining residue was washed repeatedly with a total of 4 L of water to wash away precipitated Na-salts which resulted in a significant decrease of the amount of solids on the filter. The residue was dried in high vac at room temperature over KOH to give 143 g of a yellow powder. Elemental analysis showed 5.9 weight % of Na which corresponds to 36.4 weight % of Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. This material was used for further elaboration.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Intermediate 3: 6-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)isoquinolin-3-amine\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 3-L, three-necked rbf, equipped with a condenser, thermometer and large stirrer bar was charged with DME (1 L) and a 2M Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \n(1 L, 10 eq). The two-phased system purged with nitrogen under vigorous stirring for 45 min, followed by the addition of 6-bromoisoquinolin-3-amine (44 g, 64 w % purity, 126 mmol), the commercially available boronate (50 g, 170 mmol), and PdCl\n2\n(dppf), CH\n2\nCl\n2 \ncomplex (10.6 g, 14.2 mmol, Strem) and MeOH (2 mL). The nitrogen purge was discontinued and replaced by a nitrogen in/outlet on top of the condenser. The reaction mixture was heated to rfx (internal temperature 80° C.) for a period of 16 h and allowed to cool to room temperature. The cooled reaction mixture appeared as a two-layer system with a virtually colorless, aqueous layer and a dark organic layer in which a light brown precipitate had formed. The reaction mixture was filtered over a short path of Celite (pre-wetted with MeOH) and the Celite was subsequently washed with DME (110 mL). Removal of the solids improved visibility and the water layer could be readily separated. The organic layer was further diluted with ethyl acetate (700 mL) resulting in the separation of more solids which were remove by short-path filtration over a fresh batch of Celite (pre-wetted with MeOH). The filtrate was concentrated to a volume of 30 mL and the formed solids were isolated by filtration and washed with diethyl ether (40 mL) to give 4.8 g (11%) of the desired product as a yellow solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative procedure for the preparation is as follows: To a 3-necked flask equipped with stirrer, nitrogen inlet and internal thermometer was charged with 3-amino, 6-bromoisoquinoline (6.0 g, 20.0 mmol), 2-(2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine (S-Phos) (2.0 g, 3.0 mmol), thoroughly freshly degassed DME (200 mL), water (40 mL), and Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \n(46.2 g, 142.0 mmol). The suspension was placed under nitrogen in a pre-heated oil bath at 86° C. Meanwhile, a solution of 1-BOC-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyrazole (10.8 g, 36.0 mmol) in degassed DME (30 mL) was prepared and stored under nitrogen. When the internal temperature of the suspension had reached 84° C., the Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3 \n(2.8 g, 3.0 mmol) was added, and quickly followed by dropwise addition of the pyrazole boronate solution (via syringe over 5 min). The resulting bi-phasic dark orange solution was stirred at 84° C. for 20 mins. The flask was then placed in an ice bath to cool rapidly. Once at ambient temperature, the mixture was filtered to remove inorganic substance, washed with water (2×25 mL). Upon reduction of the solution volume via evaporation the solid product was filtered and collected. The light yellow product was washed with ethyl ether 3 time (20 ml) to give a pale yellow solid product. Yield: 6.1 g, 98.4%.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\n2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-N-[6-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)isoquinolin-3-yl]acetamide\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of 2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)acetic acid (219.2 mg, 0.5 mmol) in 5 mL of anhydrous THF was added oxalyl chloride (119.6 mg, 0.95 mmol), and 100 μL of DMF also was added. A effervescence occurred. Within 1-4 minutes the effervescence stopped. The mixture was stirred for 30 minute at room temperature, followed by addition of 6-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)-isoquinolin-3-ylamine in 5 mL of pyridine (100.0 mg, 0.5 mmol). The reaction was stirred at the ambient temperature over 16 hours as it was monitored by LC/MS. To the reaction mixture was added K\n2\nCO\n3 \n(196.7 mg, 1.4 mmol) and water (2 mL). The solution was heated to 70° C. for 5 hours. Removal of the solvents provided a crude mixture that was purified by HPLC using H\n2\nO/CH\n3\nCN/0.1% acetic acid as a mobile phase to give the title compound as a crystalline solid product (9.9 mg, 5.1%). \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n, 400 MHz): δ 3.68 (2H, s), 3.73 (3H, s), 6.90 (2H, d, J=8.8 Hz), 7.31 (2H, d, J=8.6 Hz), 7.31 (1H, d, J=8.6 Hz), 7.81 (1H, dd, J=8.6, 1.5 Hz), 8.00 (1H, d, J=8.8 Hz), 8.08 (1H s), 8.10-8.22 (1H, m), 8.40 (2H, s), 9.03 (1H, s), 10.69 (1H, s), 13.09 (1H, s). \n13\nCNMR (DMSO-d\n6\n, 100 MHz): δ 40.13, 55.00, 106.29, 113.75, 120.55, 124.10, 124.38, 127.87, 128.04, 130.12, 135.25, 137.87, 147.50, 150.75, 158.04, 170.13.

\n \n \nA coupled spectrophotometric assay, coupling JNK1α1 activity to the oxidation of β-NADH to NAD+ through the action of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), was used to determine the potency (percent inhibition at 1 or 10 μM or K\ni\n) of compounds against JNK1α1 (Genbank Accession Number: L26318). The final reaction conditions were as follows: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 200 μM peptide substrate (KRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR), 300 μM NADH, 500 μM PEP (phophoenolpyruvate), 9-10 units/mL LDH, 8-12 units/mL PK, 40 nM JNK1α1\n—\n364nHis (catalytic domain containing amino acids 1-364 and N-terminal hexahistidine tag, previously activated by MKK4 and MKK7beta in vitro), 0-100 μM test compound, 2.5% DMSO, and 50 μM ATP (2.5× Km). The reaction was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The initial reaction rate was determined by the slope of the change in absorbance. To calculate percent inhibition the rate of the reaction in the presence of 1 or 10 μM compound was compared to the rate of the reaction with only DMSO multiplied by 100 percent. Note, the background rate of the above reaction in the presence of 10 μM PHA-00738186 was subtracted from all rates. To calculate the K\ni\n, the reaction rates (with the background subtracted) were plotted vs. the compound concentration (0-100 μM) and fit to the tight binding for competitive inhibitors (Morrison) equation (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \nFormula\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY\n=(−\nX+Eo\n−(\nKi\n*(1+\nA/Km\n))+((\nX−Eo\n+(\nKi\n*(1+\nA/Km\n)))̂2+4*\nEo\n*(\nKi\n*(1+\nA/Km\n)))̂0.5)*(\nVm*A\n/(\nKm+A\n)/(2*\nEo\n))\n\n \n \n \n \n \nParameters: Eo, Ki, A, Km, Vo\n \nY is initial reaction velocity;\n \nX is inhibitor concentration;\n \nA is [ATP];\n \nKi is inhibition constant;\n \nVm is Vmax;\n \nEo is total (initial) enzyme concentration;\n \nKm is ATP Km;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO at a 40× concentration. For percent inhibition experiments this would be 400 or 40 μM for 10 and 1 μM final concentration, respectively. For the Ki determination 3× serial dilutions were made starting at 4 mM (100 μM at 1×) in DMSO. A total of 11 concentrations were used for the analysis. The compounds were added to the reaction plate first. Next, a solution containing the HEPES, MgCl\n2\n, DTT, peptide substrate, NADH, PEP, PK/LDH enzyme, and JNK1α1\n—\n364nHis enzyme was added to the assay plate. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then the plate was warmed to 30° C. for 5 minutes. The reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP. The reaction was run in a plate reader at 30° C. for 20 minutes with absorbance readings made about every 10 seconds.\n\n\n \n \nJNK1α1 364nHis Purification Procedure\n\n\n \nGrowth and Induction Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nBL21 (DE3) cells containing JNK1α1\n—\n364nHis vector were grown at 37° C. until optical density (OD\n600\n) was between 0.6 to 0.8.

Each of these priority documents is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THIS INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel analogues of Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) and to derivatives thereof having a modifying moiety covalently attached. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical use of these analogues and derivatives, in particular for the treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe derivatives of the invention are protracted, e.g. capable of maintaining a low blood glucose level for a longer period of time, capable of increasing the in vivo half-life of FGF21, and/or result in a lower clearance of FGF21.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nFibroblast growth factors are polypeptides expressed in developing and adult tissues. They are involved in several physiological mechanisms including for example metabolic regulation and cellular differentiation. A whole family of more than twenty fibroblast growth factors exists (the FGF family). Three members of the FGF family including FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 form a subfamily functioning as endocrine factors involved in metabolic regulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibroblast Growth Factor 21 or FGF-21, herein for short FGF21, is expressed preferentially in the liver and has been shown to exert hormone-like metabolic effects. For example, FGF21 has been demonstrated to activate glucose uptake in mouse adipocytes, to protect mice from diet induced obesity when over-expressed in transgenic mice, and to lower blood glucose and triglyceride levels when administered to diabetic rodents (Kharitonenkov et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n(2005), 115:1627-1635). The lowering effect of FGF21 on blood glucose and triglycerides has also been shown in diabetic monkeys. FGF21 was also able to decrease LDL and to increase HDL significantly in diabetic monkeys (Kharitonenkov et al., \nEndocrinology \n(2007), 148(2):774-81).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn diet induced obese mice and ob/ob mice, FGF21 was furthermore shown to lower body weight, predominantly by an increase in energy expenditure and a reduction in adiposity (Coskun et al., \nEndocrinology \n(2008), 149(12): 6018-6027).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on these results FGF21 has been suggested as a pharmacological agent with the potential to treat diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes aspects like insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, visceral obesity and hypertension, see e.g. the definition of metabolic syndrome in Grundy et al., \nCirculation \n(2004), (109): 433-438.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 may furthermore be used as a pharmacological agent with a potential to treat Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), see Coskun et al. Endocrinology, 2008 cited above, and Xu et al., Diabetes (2009, 58(1):250-9, published electronically 7, Oct. 2008 ahead of print). NAFLD has been defined by Erickson, J. Lipid Res. (2008), published electronically 12, Dec. 2008 ahead of print. Yie et al. studied the role of the N- and C-termini of FGF21 in receptor interaction and activation, see FEBS Letters, 583 (2009), 19-24.\n\n\n \nOBJECTS OF THIS INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe object of this invention is to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues or derivatives of FGF21 which have improved properties for the treatment of diabetes, for example compared with human FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues or derivatives of FGF21 which have improved properties for the treatment of obesity, for example compared with human FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues or derivatives of FGF21 which have improved properties for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), for example compared with human FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues or derivatives of FGF21 which can relatively easy be prepared recombinant in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues or derivatives of FGF21 being protected against N-terminal degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues or derivatives of FGF21 which have increased potency with respect to glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells, for example compared with human FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to the furnishing of analogues and derivatives of FGF-21 having increased mean half-life time compared with the mean half life time of Met-FGF-21, vide the test in example 9, below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther objects of this invention are to furnish compounds which can effectively be used to treat hypertension, critical illness, the metabolic syndrome, epilepsy, cancer, acromegaly, dyslipidemia (high TG, high LDL and low HDC) and cardiovascular diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sequence of the native human FGF21 protein is available from the UNIPROT database with α-cession no. Q9NSA1. The 209 amino acid precursor protein includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-28) and a mature protein (amino acids 29-209). The mature protein is included herein as SEQ ID NO:1 (amino acids 1-181), and the signal peptide as SEQ ID NO:2 (amino acids 1-28).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn isoform or allelic form of native human FGF21 having a Pro instead of Leu in the mature protein at position 146 of SEQ ID NO:1 herein is known from, i.a., US2001012628 A1 (residue no. 174 of SEQ ID NO:2 in the published US application).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother isoform having a shorter signal peptide in which Leu at position 23 of SEQ ID NO:2 herein is missing is known from WO 2003/011213 (see SEQ ID NO: 2 of the WO publication having a signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, particular examples of native human FGF21 are: SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:1 having the substitution L146P, as well as any of these sequences preceded by the 27 or 28 amino acids signal peptide referred to above. Preferred examples of native human FGF21 are the mature parts, viz. SEQ ID NO:1 and the L146β isoform thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “analogue” as referred to herein in the context of FGF21, i.e., an FGF21 analogue, refers to polypeptides that are or can be, deduced or derived from native FGF21, from SEQ ID NO:1 in particular, by modification of the amino acid sequence thereof. Such modification, amendment or change may include substitution, deletion, and/or addition of one or more amino acids. For example, an amino acid may be added at the N-terminus end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “amino acid” or “amino acid residue” as referred to herein in the context of FGF21 modifications includes the twenty standard alpha-amino acids being used by cells in protein biosynthesis and specified by the genetic code, viz. alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine (the amino acid residues being the corresponding residues from which hydrogen has been removed from an amino group and/or a hydroxy group has been removed from a carboxy group and hydrogen may have been removed from any mercapto group). Herein, an amino acid is preferably one which can be prepared by genetic engineering.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the present purposes, the two recognized codes of the standard amino acids (one-letter and three-letter) are used interchangeably, or now and then the amino acid name is fully spelled out. These terms are of course considered fully equivalent (e.g., S=Ser=serine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “derivative” as used herein refers to an analogue of FGF21 which has been covalently modified. The term is not limiting as such, rather descriptive, as it is intended to mark a distinction between changes made to the constituent FGF21 polypeptide as such (“analogues”), and the covalent binding of a side chain to the FGF21 compound, whereby the compound is “derivatised”. If desired, this term can be substituted with other general chemical terms, for example compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNomenclature: Analogues and derivatives are named herein using, interchangeably, polypeptide nomenclature, organic chemical nomenclature, and chemical formulas, or mixtures thereof, whatever is deemed best suited for easing the understanding of the technical matter in question. For example, the derivative name S-71-({2-[2-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[(S)-4-carboxy-4-(17-carboxyheptadecanoylamino)butyrylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]ethylcarbamoyl}methyl) [71C, 121Q, 166F, 168L, 173A, 174V, 179F] Ala-FGF21 means that [71C, 121Q, 166F, 168L, 173A, 174V, 179F] Ala-FGF21 is modified by {2-[2-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[(S)-4-carboxy-4-(17-carboxyheptadecanoylamino)butyrylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]ethylcarbamoyl}methyl at the thiol group in Cys in position 71.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a substitution in an analogue may be indicated as: “Original amino acid-position-substituted amino acid” (or as “position-substituted amino acid”). The three or one letter code may be used. Accordingly, the notation “S71C” or “Ser71Cys” means, that the analogue comprises a substitution of serine with cysteine in the amino acid position corresponding to the amino acid at position 71 in human FGF21 (SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple modifications such as e.g. substitutions may be separated by commas (with a space after the comma), and if desired surrounded by brackets in order to make it clear that they belong to the same variant. Hence, the analogue designated [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21 is human FGF21 having Ala (A) in position −1, Phe (F) in position 166, Leu (L) in position 168, Val (V) in position 174, and Phe (F) in position 179.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn extension can be described by reference to SEQ ID NO:1 by addition of position numbers (continued positive numbers in the C-terminal end and negative numbers in the N-terminal end) or, more simply, by adding the amino acids of the extension in question, using the correct sequence thereof, to the compound in question, which is then often given a trivial name, such as FGF21, again in order to ease the understanding of the relevant technical point. Hence, [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21 can also be designated [L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] Ala-FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “compound” collectively covers analogues and derivatives.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nBriefly, this invention is as defined in the claims and clauses below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel analogues and derivatives of FGF21. In said derivatives, a modifying group is covalently attached to the FGF21 analogue. The invention also relates to the use of said analogues and derivatives in pharmaceutical compositions, in particular for the treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe derivatives of the invention are protracted, e.g. capable of maintaining a low blood glucose level for a longer period of time, capable of increasing the in vivo half-life of FGF21, and/or result in a lower clearance of FGF21. The derivatives of FGF21 retain satisfactory biological activity and may be administered less frequently than the parent FGF21 analogues. Furthermore, said derivatives have a reduced risk of deamidation.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, this invention relates to analogues of FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the analogues and derivatives of this invention are [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21, analogues of [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21 optionally containing one or more of the following amino acid substitutions (exchanges): 71C, 121Q, 173A and/or des181, optionally, having up to four further mutations and/or, optionally, the 179 and/or 180 amino acid is not present and derivatives of such analogues containing Cys in position 71 which derivatives have a group of the general formula HOOC—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—CONH—CH(COOH)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CONH—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nm\n—CH\n2\n—CONH—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\np\n—CH\n2\n—CONH—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—NHCO—CH\n2\n— (modifying moiety), wherein n is an integer in the range 10-20, m is an integer in the range 1-3, p is an integer in the range 1-3, and q is an integer in the range 2-4, covalently attached to the sulphur atom in the mercapto group present in the cysteine residue in position 71.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, the above aspect covers, e.g., 1) analogues of [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21 containing one or more of the following amino acid substitutions (exchanges): 71C, 121Q, 173A and/or des181, 2) analogues of [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21 having up to four further mutations (apart from any mutation(s) selected from the group consisting of 71C, 121Q, 173A and/or des181), 3) analogues of [−1A, L166F, M168L, G174V, Y179F] FGF21 wherein the 179 and/or 180 amino acid is not present and 4) any combination of 1), 2) and/or 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above expression “having up to four further mutations” means that up to four amino acid residues have been exchanged, inserted or cancelled in FGF-21, apart from any mutation(s) selected from the group consisting of 71C, 121Q, 173A and/or des181.

The mature FGF21 polypeptide consisting of the remaining 181 amino acids is included in the sequence listing as SEQ ID NO:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mature FGF21 polypeptide was cloned and expressed as an intracellular protein in \nE. coli\n, without the signal peptide, but with an added N-terminal methionine or an N-terminal Met-Ala which is processed in \nE. coli \nresulting in N-terminal Ala (−1Ala). More in particular, a 550 by coding region including at the 3′-end the ATG codon for Met, as well as Nde1 and BamH1 restriction sites at the 3′- and 5′-ends, respectively, was inserted into the expression vector pET 11c in Nde1-BamH1 under control of the phage T7 promoter, and transformed into \nE. coli \nB BL21(DE3). The cells were grown in LB amp 100 ug/mL to OD\n450 \n0.5, and expression was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG for 4 hours at 37° C. Crude extracts of cells were made by sonication for analysis of FGF21 expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE showed successful expression of FGF21 which was identified mainly in the soluble supernatant fraction, with very little in the insoluble pellet. Although the calculated MW of the thus expressed FGF21 (Met-FGF21) (Compound A) is 19.5 kD, it migrated on the gel as a 25 kD protein, which is likely due to the high content of prolines, delaying the movement of the protein.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nCloning and Expression of FGF21 Analogues\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following, specific analogues of FGF21 can be prepared as is known in the art and expressed in \nE. coli \nas generally described in Example 1:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalog\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nSequence modifications to human FGF21 (Seq.

The cells are not allowed to reach confluence and should be passed (transferred to new vials) before reaching approx. 60% of confluency (by visual inspection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the glucose uptake assay, cells are plated 80,000 cells/well in a 24 well plate, or 20,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate, and when they reach confluency (high density, with a view to have differentiated adipose cells made), the medium is changed from basal medium to basal medium containing Troglitazone, IBMX, Dexamethasone (commercially available from, e.g., Sigma) and human insulin (commercially available from, e.g., Novo Nordisk A/S).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells are used 7-14, preferably 7-10, days after initiation of differentiation. The cells are stimulated with increasing concentrations (0-300 nM) of the FGF21 polypeptides or derivatives of the invention for 20 hours in basal medium. Before addition of 3H-deoxyglucose (in what follows: the tracer) the cells are washed in warm (approximately 37° C.) assay buffer (PBS with 1 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 2 mM CaCl\n2\n), HEPES and 0.1% Human serum albumin) and the cells are incubated with the tracer for 1 hour. This incubation is terminated by washing twice in ice cold assay buffer. The cells are lysed with Triton X-100 and lysates transferred to a 96 wells plate, microscint-40 (commercially available from, e.g., Perkin Elmer) is added and amount of tracer counted in a TOP-counter (e.g. a Packard top-counter from Perkin Elmer). The EC\n50 \nof the polypeptide in question is calculated.

The HEK293T/b-klotho stable cells were seeded at 30000 cells/well on 96-well plates. After two days, fresh media was added, and after 2 hours more the FGF21 proteins were added. The plates were incubated for 12 minutes. And total ERK phosphorylation was assessed using an AlphaScreen SureFire Phospho-ERK1/2 Assay Kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and an EnVision Multilabel Microplate Reader Model 2103 (Perkin Elmer) with the AlphaScreen HTS Turbo option was used for signal detection.
