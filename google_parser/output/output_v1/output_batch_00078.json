Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a U.S. National Stage application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2006/007011 (published as WO 2007/009721 A2), filed Jul. 17, 2006, which claims priority to the following applications: EP Application No. 05384029.4, filed Jul. 15, 2005 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/705,432, filed Aug. 5, 2005. Benefit of the filing date of each of these prior applications is hereby claimed. Each of these prior applications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds, methods for their preparation, medicaments comprising these compounds as well as their use for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of humans and animals.\n\n\nCannabinoids are compounds, which are derived from the cannabis sativa plant which is commonly known as marijuana. The most active chemical compound of the naturally occurring cannabinoids is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), particularly Δ\n9\n-THC.\n\n\nThese naturally occurring cannabinoids as well as their synthetic analogues promote their physiological effects via binding to specific G-coupled receptors, the so-called cannabinoid-receptors.\n\n\nAt present, two distinct types of receptors that bind both the naturally occurring and synthetic cannabinoids have been identified and cloned. These receptors, which are designated CB\n1 \nand CB\n2 \nare involved in a variety of physiological or pathophysiological processes in humans and animals, e.g. processes related to the central nervous system, immune system, cardiovascular system, endocrinous system, respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract or to reproduction, as described for example, in Hollister, Pharm. Rev. 38, 1986, 1-20; Reny and Singha, Prog. Drug. Res., 36, 71-114, 1991; Consroe and Sandyk, in Marijuana/Cannabinoids, Neurobiology and Neurophysiology, 459, Murphy L. and Barthe A. Eds., CRC Press, 1992.\n\n\nTherefore, compounds, which have a high binding affinity for these cannabinoid receptors and which are suitable for modulating these receptors are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of cannabinoid-receptor related disorders.\n\n\nIn particular, the CB\n1\n-Receptor is involved in many different food-intake related disorders such as bulimia or obesity, including obesity associated with type II diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) and thus, compounds suitable for regulating this receptor may be used in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of these disorders.\n\n\nThus, it was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds for use as active substances in medicaments. In particular, these active substances should be suitable for the modulation of Cannabinoid receptors, more particularly for the modulation of Cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n) receptors.\n\n\nSaid object was achieved by providing the cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I given below, their stereoisomers, corresponding salts and corresponding solvates thereof.\n\n\nIt has been found that these compounds have a high affinity for cannabinoid receptors, particularly for the CB\n1\n-receptor, and that they act as modulators e.g. antagonists, inverse agonists or agonists on these receptors. They are therefore suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of various disorders related to the central nervous system, the immune system, the cardiovascular system, the endocrinous system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract or reproduction in humans and/or animals, preferably humans including infants, children and grown-ups.\n\n\nThus, in one of its aspects the present invention relates to substituted Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nZ is selected from C\n1-4\n-Alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or linear, saturated or unsaturated;\n\n\nX and Y independently represent phenyl, thienyl, naphtyl or pyridyl which groups may be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents W, which can be the same or different, selected from the group\n        \n \nbranched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkyl or branched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkoxy, phenyl, hydroxy, chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo, SH, trifluoromethyl, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCHF\n2\n, trifluoromethylthio, trifluoromethoxy, methylsulfonyl, carboxyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, cyano, carbamoyl, sulfamoyl and acetyl; O—P, with P denominating a prodrug group consisting of aryl, C\n8-20\n-alkyl, heteroaryl, C(O)-aryl, C(O)heteroaryl, C(O)—C\n1-20\n-alkyl;\n \n\n\n\n\nR\n8 \nrepresenting a hydrogen atom or a branched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkyl group, while R\n9 \nis representing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nbeing independently from one another selected from H, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCF\n3\n, a keto-group, NO\n2 \nor NH\n2\n;\n\n\nor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n8 \nand R\n9 \ntogether with the connecting Nitrogen atom are representing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nbeing independently from one another selected from H, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCF\n3\n, a keto-group, NO\n2 \nor NH\n2\n;\n\n\noptionally in the form of its racemate, pure stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers, in any suitable ratio;\n\n\nin the form shown or in form of the acid or base or in form of a salt, especially a physiologically acceptable salt, or in form of a solvate, especially a hydrate or in form of a corresponding N-oxide thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of this invention, alkyl radical or group is understood as meaning saturated and unsaturated, linear or branched hydrocarbons, which can be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted.

under inert atmosphere to yield a substituted pyrazoline compound of general formula I, which is optionally isolated and/or optionally purified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inventive process is also illustrated in scheme I given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction of the benzaldehyde compound of general formula V with a pyruvate compound of general formula VI is preferably carried out in the presence of at least one base, more preferably in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or an alkali metal methoxide such as sodium methoxide, as described, for example, in Synthetic communications, 26(11), 2229-33, (1996). The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure. Preferably sodium pyruvate may be used as the pyruvate compound. Preferably said reaction is carried out in a protic reaction medium such as a C\n1-4 \nalkyl alcohol or mixtures of these. Mixtures of such alcohols with water, e.g. ethanol/water may also be used.\n\n\nReaction temperature as well as the duration of the reaction may vary over a broad range. Preferred reaction temperatures range from −10° C. to the boiling point of the reaction medium. Suitable reaction times may vary for example from several minutes to several hours.\n\n\nAlso preferred the reaction of the benzaldehyde compound of general formula V with a pyruvate compound of general formula VI is carried out under acid catalysed conditions, more preferably by refluxing the mixture in dichloromethane in the presence of copper(II)trifluoromethanesulfonate as described, for example, in Synlett, (1), 147-149, 2001. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure.\n\n\nThe reaction of the compound of general formula (VII) with an optionally substituted phenyl hydrazin of general formula (VIII) is preferably carried out in a suitable reaction medium such as C\n1-4\n-alcohols or ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofurane or mixtures of at least two of these aforementioned compounds. Also preferably, said reaction may be carried out in the presence of an acid, whereby the acid may be organic such as acetic acid and/or inorganic such as hydrochloric acid. Furthermore, the reaction may also be carried out in the presence of a base such as piperidine, piperazine, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, or a mixture of at least two of these bases may also be used.\n\n\nReaction temperature as well as the duration of the reaction may vary over a broad range. Suitable reaction temperatures range from room temperature, i.e. approximately 25° C. to the boiling point of the reaction medium. Suitable reaction times may vary for example from several minutes to several hours.\n\n\nThe carboxylic group of the compound of general formula (VIII) may be activated for further reactions by the introduction of a suitable leaving group according to conventional methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nPreferably the compounds of general formula (IX) are transferred into an acid chloride, an acid anhydride, a mixed anhydride, a C\n1-4 \nalkyl ester, an activated ester such as p-nitrophenylester. Other well known methods for the activation of acids include the activation with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or benzotriazol-N-oxotris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP)).\n\n\nIf said activated compound of general formula (XI) is an acid chloride, it is preferably prepared by reaction of the corresponding acid of general formula (IX) with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, whereby said chlorinating agent is also used as the solvent. Also preferably an additional solvent may be used. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride, ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofurane or dimethoxyethane. Mixtures of two or more solvents from one class or two or more solvents from different classes may also be used. Preferred reaction temperature range from 0° C. to the boiling point of the solvent and reaction times from several minutes to several hours.\n\n\nIf said activated compound of general formula (XI) is a mixed anhydride, said anhydride may preferably be prepared, for example, by reaction of the corresponding acid of general formula (IX) with ethyl chloroformiate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine, in a suitable solvent.\n\n\nThe aforementioned reactions involving the synthesis of the 4,5-dihydro-pyrazole ring or the reaction of a compound comprising said ring are carried out under an inert atmosphere, preferably nitrogen or argon, to avoid oxidation of the ring-system.\n\n\nDuring some synthetic reactions described above the protection of sensitive or reactive groups may be necessary and/or desirable. This can be performed by using conventional protective groups like those described in Protective groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J. F. W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wuts and Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & sons, 1991. The respective parts of the description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure. The protective groups may be eliminated when convenient by means well-known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nIf the Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I are obtained in form of a mixture of stereoisomers, particularly enantiomers or diastereomers, said mixtures may be separated by standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, e.g. chromatographic methods or crystallization with chiral reagents. It is also possible to obtain pure stereoisomers via stereoselective synthesis.\n\n\nIn a further aspect the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of salts of Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I and stereoisomers thereof, wherein at least one compound of general formula I having at least one basic group is reacted with at least one inorganic and/or organic acid, preferably in the presence of a suitable reaction medium. Suitable reaction media include, for example, any of the ones given above. Suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, suitable organic acids are e.g. citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, or derivatives thereof, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or camphersulfonic acid.\n\n\nIn yet a further aspect the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of salts of Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I or stereoisomers thereof, wherein at least one compound of general formula I having at least one acidic group is reacted with one or more suitable bases, preferably in the presence of a suitable reaction medium. Suitable bases are e.g. hydroxides, carbonates or alkoxides, which include suitable cations, derived e.g. from alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals or organic cations, e.g. [NH\nn\nR\n4-n\n]\n+\n, wherein n is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and R represents a branched or unbranched C\n1-4\n-alkyl-radical. Suitable reaction media are, for example, any of the ones given above.\n\n\nIn the presence of several acidic or basic groups, mono- or poly-salts may be formed. Compounds of the formula I having an acidic group, for example a free carboxyl group, and a basic group, for example an amino group, may also be present in the form of inner salts, i.e., in zwitterionic form, or a part of the molecule may be present in the form of an inner salt and another part in the form of a normal salt.\n\n\nSolvates, preferably hydrates, of the Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I, of corresponding stereoisomers, of corresponding N-oxides or of corresponding salts thereof may also be obtained by standard procedures known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nIndoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I, which comprise nitrogen-atom containing saturated, unsaturated or aromatic rings may also be obtained in the form of their N-oxides by methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe purification and isolation of the inventive Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I, of a corresponding stereoisomer, or salt, or N-oxide, or solvate or any intermediate thereof may, if required, be carried out by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art, e.g. chromatographic methods or recrystallization.\n\n\nThe compounds of general formula I given above may also act as prodrugs, i.e. they represent a drug precursor, which following administration to a patient releases a drug in vivo via some kind of chemical and/or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to a physiological pH and/or through an enzyme action is converted to a desired drug form; see, e.g., R. B. Silverman, 1992, “The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action”, Academic Press, Chp. 8). In particular, the compounds of general formula I give rise to a compound of general formula I, wherein R\n3 \nrepresents a —OH moiety, upon administration to a patient.\n\n\nProdrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution (e.g., to allow compounds which would not typically enter the reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics for a particular compound. For example, a hydroxyl group, can be esterified, e.g., with a carboxylic acid group to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject, the ester is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively or hydrolytically, to reveal the hydroxyl group.\n\n\nThe Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I given above, their stereoisomers, corresponding N-oxides, corresponding salts thereof and corresponding solvates are toxicologically acceptable and are therefore suitable as pharmaceutical active substances for the preparation of medicaments.\n\n\nIt has been found that the Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I given above, stereoisomers thereof, N-oxides thereof, corresponding salts and corresponding solvates have a high affinity to cannabinoid receptors, particularly cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n)-receptors, i.e. they are selective ligands for the (CB\n1\n)-receptor and act as modulators, e.g. antagonists, inverse agonists or agonists, on these receptors. In particular, these pyrazoline compounds show little or no development of tolerance during treatment, particularly with respect to food intake, i.e. if the treatment is interrupted for a given period of time and then continued afterwards, the inventively used pyrazoline compounds will again show the desired effect. After ending the treatment with the pyrazoline compounds, the positive influence on the body weight is found to continue.\n\n\nFurthermore, these Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds show relatively weak Herg channel affinity, thus a low risk of prolongation of the QT-interval is to be expected for these compounds.\n\n\nIn summary, the inventively used 4-substituted pyrazoline compounds are distinguished by a broad spectrum of beneficial effects, while at the same time showing relatively little undesired effects, i.e. effects which do not positively contribute to or even interfere with the well being of the patient.\n\n\nThus, an other aspect of the present invention relates to a medicament comprising at least one Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compound of general formula I, optionally in form of one of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, a racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding N-oxide thereof, or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate thereof, and optionally at least one physiologically acceptable auxiliary agent.\n\n\nPreferably said medicament is suitable for the modulation (regulation) of cannabinoid-receptors, preferably cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n) receptors, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, disorders of the immune system, disorders of the cardiovascular system, disorders of the endocrinous system, disorders of the respiratory system, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract or reproductive disorders.\n\n\nParticularly preferably said medicament is suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of psychosis.\n\n\nAlso particularly preferably said medicament is suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of food intake disorders, preferably bulimia, anorexia, cachexia, obesity and/or type II diabetus mellitus (non-insuline dependent diabetes mellitus), more preferably obesity. The inventive medicament also seems to be active in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of appetency disorders, e.g. the pyrazoline compounds of general formula I also reduce the desire for sweets.\n\n\nAlso particularly preferably said medicament is suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of cancer, preferably for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of one or more types of cancer selected from the group consisting of brain cancer, bone cancer, lip cancer, mouth cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, pancreas cancer, ovary cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, bowel cancer and prostate cancer, more preferably for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of one or more types of cancer selected from the group consisting of colon cancer, bowel cancer and prostate cancer.\n\n\nParticularly preferably said medicament is suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol addiction, nicotine abuse and/or nicotine addiction, drug abuse and/or drug addiction and/or medicament abuse and/or medicament addiction, preferably drug abuse and/or drug addiction and/or nicotine abuse and/or nicotine addiction.\n\n\nMedicaments and/or drugs, which are frequently the subject of misuse include opioids, barbiturates, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine, hallucinogens and benzodiazepines.\n\n\nThe medicament is also suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of one or more disorders selected from the group consisting of bone disorders, preferably osteoporosis (e.g. osteoporosis associated with a genetic predisposition, sex hormone deficiency, or ageing), cancer-associated bone disease or Paget's disease of bone; schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, neurodegenerative disorders, cerebellar disorders, spinocerebellar disorders, cognitive disorders, cranial trauma, head trauma, stroke, panic attacks, peripheric neuropathy, inflammation, glaucoma, migraine, Morbus Parkinson, Morbus Huntington, Morbus Alzheimer, Raynaud's disease, tremblement disorders, compulsive disorders, senile dementia, thymic disorders, tardive dyskinesia, bipolar disorders, medicament-induced movement disorders, dystonia, endotoxemic shock, hemorrhagic shock, hypotension, insomnia, immunologic disorders, sclerotic plaques, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma, memory disorders, pruritus, pain, or for potentiation of the analgesic effect of narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics, or for influencing intestinal transit.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention is the use of at least one Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compound of general formula I given above as suitable active substances, optionally in form of one of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, a racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding N-oxide thereof, or a corresponding salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate thereof, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, for the preparation of a medicament for the modulation of cannabinoid-receptors, preferably cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n) receptors, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, disorders of the immune system, disorders of the cardiovascular system, disorders of the endocrinous system, disorders of the respiratory system, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract or reproductive disorders.\n\n\nParticularly preferred is the use of at least one of the respective Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds, optionally in form of one of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, a racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding N-oxide thereof, or a corresponding salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate thereof, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of psychosis.\n\n\nAlso particularly preferred is the use of at least one of the respective Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds, optionally in form of one of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, a racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding N-oxide thereof, or a corresponding salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate thereof, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of food intake disorders, preferably bulimia, anorexia, cachexia, obesity and/or type II diabetus mellitus (non-insuline dependent diabetes mellitus), more preferably obesity.\n\n\nAlso particularly preferred is the use of at least one of the pyrazoline compounds as defined herein and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nThe metabolic syndrome and definitions thereof are described in detail by Eckel et al., The Lancet, Vol. 365 (2005), 1415-1428, included herewith by reference. One of the respective definitions was established by the WHO in 1998 (as described in Alberti et al., Diabet. Med. 1998, 15, pages 539-53, the respective description thereof is herewith incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure). The other, more widely accepted, definition of the metabolic syndrome was established by the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 2001, as described in JAMA 2001; 285; 2486-97, the respective description thereof is herewith incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe metabolic syndrome is characterized by an interaction of several physiological parameters such as triglycerides, lipids, blood pressure, glucose levels and insuline levels.\n\n\nEven though obesity may play a critical role in the development of metabolic syndrome, many of its aspects are weight independent, especially some lipid parameters. Especially the positive influence on the weight independent aspects of the metabolic syndrome (see e.g. Pagotto and Pasquali, The Lancet, Vol. 365 (2005), 1363, 1364, included herewith by reference) like some blood parameters, especially lipid parameters is one of the major and surprising advantages of the inventively used substituted pyrazoline compounds.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention is

preferably understood as being <40 mg/dl in men and <50 mg/dl in women,\n\n\nHypertension, whereby hypertension is preferably understood as being >130/85 mmHg,\n\n\nImpaired fasting glucose, whereby impaired fasting glucose levels are preferably understood as being >110 mg/dl,\n\n\nInsulin Resistance\n\n\nDyslipidemia.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention is the use of one or more pyrazoline compounds as defined herein for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of the weight independent aspects of metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention is a method for improving cardiovascular and/or metabolic risk factors, such as one or more of the following factors:\n\n\nElevated triglycerides, whereby elevated levels of triglycerides are preferably understood as

particularly preferred is the use of at least one of the respective Indoline-substituted pyrazoline compounds, optionally in form of one of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, a racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding N-oxide thereof, or a corresponding salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate thereof, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of cancer, preferably for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of one or more types of cancer selected from the group consisting of brain cancer, bone cancer, lip cancer, mouth cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, pancreas cancer, ovary cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, bowel cancer and prostate cancer, more preferably for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of one or more types of cancer selected from the group consisting of colon cancer, bowel cancer and prostate cancer.\n\n\nAlso particularly preferred is the use of at

Those skilled in the art are familiar with the starting materials that are needed to obtain said compounds.\n\n\na) Preparation of Compound of General Formula (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-3-methyl (or 3-ethyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Where W has the meaning given above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of aqueous 0.5 M NaOH (1.5 equivalents), under N\n2 \nat room temperature, 2-oxobutyric acid (1.1 equivalents) is added in portions. The reaction is then left stirring for 5 min and a solution of 4-substituted-benzaldehyde (1 equivalent) in abs. EtOH (0.9 M) is then slowly added (10 mL/h). The reaction is left to stir at 25° C. overnight.\n\n\nWater is added, and the solution evaporated under reduced pressure to eliminate the excess of EtOH. The solution is then washed with toluene and evaporated (to eliminate traces of this solvent). The aqueous solution is then cooled down in an ice bath and conc. HCl (0.2 mL of conc HCl per mL of base) are slowly added under magnetically stirring. A white solid precipitates from the solution which is kept at 0° C. for another hour. The solid is filtered under vacuum through a sintered funnel (porosity 3) and dried at 40° C. under vacuum.\n\n\nThe yield range for this aldolic condensation is 60-86%.\n\n\nIf the starting material is 2-oxopentanoic acid (oxovaleric acid) instead of 2-oxobutyric acid, this reaction leads to (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-3-ethyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acids, although in this case, the yield of the reaction is slightly lower (around 40-50%)\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic Acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 2.17 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 7.44 (4H, ap d, J=3.28 Hz, ArH), 8.41 (1H, s, CH).\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-bromophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic Acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CD\n3\nOD): δ 1.99 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 7.36 (2H, d, J=8.5 Hz, ArH), 7.40 (1H, s, CH), 7.53 (2H, d, J=8.5 Hz, ArH).\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic Acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 2.18 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 7.20 (2H, m), 7.53 (2H, m), 8.26 (1H, s, CH);\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid. This compound is prepared following the method described above but using 3 eq of NaOH instead of 1.5 eq.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (200 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 2.09 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 3.84 (3H, s, OCH\n3\n), 7.01 (2H, d, J=8.8 Hz, ArH), 7.50 (1H, s, CH), 7.52 (2H, d, J=8.8 Hz, ArH).\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-bromophenyl)-3-ethyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic Acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 1.16 (3H, t, J=7.5 Hz, CH\n3\n), 2.62 (2H, q, J=7.5 Hz, CH\n2\n), 7.35 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 7.59 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 8.23 (1H, s, CH).\n\n\nb) Preparation of Compound of General Formula cis or trans 5-(4-substituted-Phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl (or 4-ethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Where W has the meaning given above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suspension of 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (1 equivalent) in glacial acetic acid (40 equivalents) is heated at 80° C. under nitrogen atmosphere. When the suspension becomes a solution, a solution of (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl-3-methyl-2-oxo-3-butenoic acid (1 equivalent) in acetic acid (20 equivalents) is added and the solution left to stir at 80° C. for 2 h.\n\n\nThen, the mixture can be let crystallizing at 0-4° C. overnight after some concentration of acetic acid. The beige solid formed afterwards is filtrated under vacuum through a sintered funnel (porosity 4) and washed several times with water. This crystallization process leads to the major diastereoisomeric acid cis.\n\n\nThe yield range for the cyclization with hydrazine to obtain the main diastereoisomer cis is around 46-60%.\n\n\nIf the starting material is (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-3-ethyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid, cis-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid is obtained. In this case, the yield for the cyclization is around 40%.\n\n\nThe reaction mixture can also be cooled down to room temperature and poured through an addition funnel to water, cooled in an ice bath with magnetically stirring. The addition must be slow and at least double the volume of water per volume of acetic acid is required. It should form a precipitate, but in the case a gum starts to be formed, it should be filtered and the rest of the material poured into another large volume of water. The solid obtained is suspended in water several times and filtered until the pH of the water is above 3. This solid also corresponds to the cis form.\n\n\nAlternatively, the dark mixture can be extracted with dichloromethane washed thoroughly with H\n2\nO, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand evaporated to dryness. Recrystallisation of the crude material with toluene (3 to 4 mL of toluene per gram of material) allows the recovery of the major diastereoisomer cis.\n\n\nFormation of the methyl esters, followed by purification by column chromatography, allows the separation of the two diastereoisomeric forms. Then, a hydrolysis of the pure esters gives the corresponding acids cis and trans. Example: Methyl iodide (0.16 ml, 2.25 mmol) was added dropwise to a mixture of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (0.47 g, 1.27 mmol) and KHCO\n3 \n(0.19 g, 1.9 mmol) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (10 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen overnight (ca 16 h). Water was added, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined organic layers were thoroughly washed with aq. NaCl. After drying over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand evaporation under reduced pressure, 0.5 g of the crude product were obtained. Purification by column chromatography (SiO\n2\n, 40:1 SiO\n2\n, packed with 100% hexane and eluted with a gradient of 1% to 5% ethyl acetate) affords 0.045 g (9% yield) of the minor isomer (trans racemic mixture) and 0.23 g (48% yield) of the major isomer (cis racemic mixture). Hydrolysis of the esters in the presence of NaOH leads to the corresponding acids.\n\n\nAnother way to acids trans is described below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of 2,4-dichloroaniline (1 g, 6.17 mmol) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.5 ml) in ice (1.5 ml) a solution of NaNO\n2 \n(0.460 mg, 6.68 mmol) in water (0.8 ml) is slowly added and the mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0-5° C. Then, this solution is added over a cold mixture of NaOAc (1.64 g, 19.6 mmol), ethanol (26 ml) and ethyl-2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (1.0 g, 6.06 mmol) and let stirring for 1 hour until the formed precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with ethanol and dichloromethane and dried in vacuo to give the yellow solid ethyl 2-chloro-2-(2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazono)acetate (70-80% yield), which is used in the next step without any further purification.\n\n\nThen, triethylamine (2.8 eq) is added to a solution of 2-chloro-2-(2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazono)acetate (1 eq) and a 4-substituted trans-β-methylstyrene (3 eq) in toluene, and the mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for 1 hour. The formed precipitate is removed by filtration after cooling to room temperature. The filtrate is concentrated and purified using a Combiflah system from Isco, eluting with cyclohexane and ethyl acetate (in a gradient program until 30% AcOEt), to obtain pure ethyl trans-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate, (˜40% yield). Another compound can be isolated from the purification, which is identified as the regioisomer ethyl trans-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate (˜10% yield).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nethyl trans-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (300 MHz, CHLOROFORM-d) δ ppm 1.00 (d, J=6.6 Hz, 3H) 1.18 (t, J=7.2 Hz, 3H) 4.06 (d, J=3.3 Hz, 1H) 4.16 (m, 2H) 4.91 (m, 1H) 7.10-7.45 (m, 8H)\n\n\nEthyl trans-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate is hydrolyzed in the presence of aqueous 2 M NaOH (2 eq) and tetrahydrofuran for 4 hours. Then, tetrahydrofuran is partially removed by evaporation, 1 M HCl is added until pH is below 3 and the aqueous mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield a white solid identified as trans-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (85% yield).

In-Vitro Determination of Affinity to CB1/CB2-Receptors\n\n\n\nThe in-vitro determination of the affinity of the inventive quaternary ammonium salts of substituted pyrazoline compounds to CB\n1\n/CB\n2\n-Rezeptors is carried out as described in the publication of Ruth A. Ross, Heather C. Brockie et al., “Agonist-inverse agonist characterization at CB\n1 \nand CB\n2 \ncannabinoid receptors of L-759633, L759656 and AM630”, British Journal of Pharmacology, 126, 665-672, (1999), whereby the transfected human CB\n1 \nand CB\n2 \nreceptors of Receptor Biology, Inc. are used. The radioligand used for both receptors is [\n3\nH]-CP55940. The respective parts of the description are hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nThe affinity of the inventive substituted pyrazoline compounds to CB\n1\n/CB\n2 \nreceptors was determined as described above. Some of the EC50-values obtained are given in the table 3 below.\n\n\nAs can be seen from the values given in table 3 the inventive pyrazoline compounds are particularly suitable for regulating the CB\n1\n-Receptor.\n\n\nII. In-Vivo Bioassay System for Determination of Cannabinoid Activity\n\n\nMouse Tetrad Model\n\n\nSubstances with affinity for cannabinoid receptors are known to produce a wide range of pharmacological effects. It is also known that intravenous administration of a substance with affinity for cannabinoid receptors in mice produces analgesia, hypothermia, sedation and catalepsy. Individually, none of these effects can be considered as proof that a tested substance has affinity for cannabinoid-receptors, since all of these effects are common for various classes of centrally active agents. However, substances, which show all of these effects, i.e. substances that are active in this so-called tetrad model are considered to have affinity for the cannabinoid receptors. It has further been shown that cannabinoid receptor antagonists are highly effective in blocking the effects of a cannabinoid agonist in the mouse tetrad model.\n\n\nThe tetrad model is described, for example, in the publication of A. C. Howlett et al, International Union of Pharmacology XXVII. Classification of Cannabinoid Receptors, Pharmacol Rev 54, 161-202, 2002 and David R. Compton et al., “In-vivo Characterization of a Specific Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonist (SR141716A): Inhibition of Tetrahydrocannbinol-induced Responses and Apparent Agonist Activity”, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 277, 2, 586-594, 1996. The corresponding parts of the description are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\n\nMale NMRI mice with a weight of 20-30 g (Harlan, Barcelona, Spain) are used in all of the following experiments.\n\n\nBefore testing in the behavioral procedures given below, mice are acclimatized to the experimental setting. Pre-Treatment control values are determined for analgesia hot plate latency (in seconds), rectal temperature, sedation and catalepsy.\n\n\nIn order to determine the agonistic activity of the substance to be tested, the mice are injected intravenously with the substance to be tested or the vehicle alone. 15 minutes after injection, latency in hot plate analgesia is measured.\n\n\nRectal temperature, sedation and catalepsy are measured 20 minutes after injection.\n\n\nIn order to determine the antagonistic activity the identical procedure is used as for the determination of the agonistic effects, but with the difference that the substance to be evaluated for its antagonistic activity is injectected 5 minutes before the intravenous injection of 1.25 mg/kg Win-55,212 a known cannabinoid-receptor agonist.\n\n\nHot Plate Analgesia\n\n\nThe hot plate analgesia is determined according to the method described in Woolfe D. et al. “The evaluation of analgesic action of pethidine hydrochloride (Demerol)”, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 80, 300-307, 1944. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe mice are placed on a hot plate (Harvard Analgesimeter) at 55±0.5° C. until they show a painful sensation by licking their paws or jumping and the time for these sensations to occur is recorded. This reading is considered the basal value (B). The maximum time limit the mice are allowed to remain on the hot plate in absence of any painful response is 40 seconds in order to prevent skin damage. This period is called the cut-off time (PC).\n\n\nFifteen minutes after the administration of the substance to be tested, the mice are again placed on the hot plate and the afore described procedure is repeated. This period is called the post-treatment reading (PT).\n\n\nThe degree of analgesia is calculated from the formula:\n\n\n% MPE of Analgesia=(\nPT−B\n)/(\nPC−B\n)×100\n\n\nMPE=Maximum possible effect.\n\n\nDetermination of Sedation and Ataxia\n\n\n\nSedation and ataxia is determined according to the method described in Desmet L. K. C. et al. “Anticonvulsive properties of Cinarizine and Flunarizine in Rats and Mice”, Arzneim.-Forsch. (Frug Res) 25, 9, 1975. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe chosen scoring system is\n\n\n0: no ataxia;\n\n\n1: doubful;\n\n\n2: obvious calmness and quiet;\n\n\n3 pronounced ataxia;\n\n\nprior to as well as after treatment.\n\n\nThe percentage of sedation is determined according to the formula:\n\n\n% of sedation=arithmetic mean/3×100\n\n\nHypothermia:\n\n\n\nHypothermia is determined according to the method described in David R. Compton et al. “In-vivo Characterization of a Specific Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonist (SR141716A) Inhibition of Tetrahydrocannbinol-induced Responses and Apparent Agonist Activity”, J. Pharmacol Exp Ther. 277, 2, 586-594, 1996. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe base-line rectal temperatures are determined with a thermometer (Yello Springs Instruments Co., Panlabs) and a thermistor probe inserted to 25 mm before the administration of the substance to be tested. Rectal temperature is again measured 20 minutes after the administration of the substances to be tested. The temperature difference is calculated for each animal, whereby differences of ≧−2° C. are considered to represent activity.\n\n\nCatalepsy:\n\n\nCatalepsy is determined according to the method described in Alpermann H. G. et al. “Pharmacological effects of Hoe 249: A new potential antidepressant”, Drugs Dev. Res. 25, 267-282.1992. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe cataleptic effect of the substance to be tested is evaluated according to the duration of catalepsy, whereby the animals are placed head downwards with their kinlegs upon the top of the wooden block.\n\n\nThe chosen scoring system is:\n\n\nCatalepsy for\n\n\nmore than 60 seconds=6; 50-60 seconds=5, 40-50 seconds=4, 30-40 seconds=3, 20-30 seconds=2, 5-10 seconds=1, and less than 5 seconds=0.\n\n\nThe percentage of catalepsy is determined according to the following formula:\n\n\n% Catalepsy=arithmetic mean/6×100\n\n\nAntagonistic Assay:\n\n\nMaterials and Methods.\n\n\nMembrane Preparation:\n\n\n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing recombinant human cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1) were cultured in nutrient mixture Ham's F 12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 U/ml streptomycin and 0.5 mg/ml geneticin. In order to obtain cells, culture flasks were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and scraped. Then, cells were collected by centrifugation (200×g, 10 min) and stored dry at −80° C. Cells were homogenized in ice-cold 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 40,000×g for 15 min at 4° C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C. The final pellet was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), and divided in aliquots and stored at −80° C. until use.\n\n\n[\n35\nS]GTPγS Binding Assay:\n\n\nThe reaction was performed in 96-well plates. Membranes (15 □g protein/well) were incubated for 60 min at 30° C. in buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% wt/vol bovine serum albumin, 5 μM GDP, saponin (10 μg/ml), 0.5 nM [\n35\nS]GTPγS, pH 7.4) with compound at 1 μM final concentration in either the absence or presence of dose response curve of agonist WIN 55,212-2 between 3 nM and 3 μM. The incubation was terminated by rapid filtration through Millipore Multiscreen glass fiber FB, and rinsed two-times with ice-cold assay buffer. Filter plates were dried and 30 μl of scintillation liquid was added. Radioactivity was determined using Wallac Microbeta Trilux. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. A WIN 55,212-2 dose-response was systematically performed.\n\n\nCalculations:\n\n\nThe average of basal [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding was subtracted from all binding data. In order to compare the antagonism results from one screening campaign to another one, the difference between the maximal agonist effect of WIN 55,212-2 alone, and the maximal antagonism effect due to WIN 55,212-2 with an internal standard CB1-antagonist was defined as 100%.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nThe determination of cannabinoid activity in-vivo was determined as described above. The antagonistic effect (against Win 55212-2) was determined for some of the compounds as given in the table 3 below:\n\n\nThe results of testing some of the above examples for binding and antagonism are shown together in the following table 3:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample\n \nIC50 (nM)\n \nAntagonism (%)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n100\n \n70\n \n \n \n5\n \n128.1\n \n16 ± 15\n \n \n \n7\n \n39\n \n67 ± 3 \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIII. In Vivo Testing for Antiobesic Activity\n\n\na) Acute-Treatment\n\n\n\nNormally handled rats are habituated to a reversed cycle 12/12 h, and the compound as well as saline is acutely orally administered. After administration the cumulated food intake (g) is measured at 6 h and 23 h. Following that the difference in body weight between control and compound treated animals is measured.\n\n\nb) Long-Term-Treatment\n\n\nThe in-vivo testing for antiobesic activity of the inventive pyrazoline compounds is carried out as described in the publication of G. Colombo et al., “Appetite Suppression and Weight Loss after the Cannabinoid Antagonist SR 141716”; Life Sciences, 63 (8), 113-117, (1998). The respective part of the description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nIV. In Vivo Testing for Antidepressant Activity\n\n\nThe in-vivo testing for antidepressant activity of the inventive pyrazoline compounds in the water despair test is carried out as described in the publication of E. T. Tzavara et al., “The CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A selectively increases monoaminergic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex: implications for therapeutic actions”; Br. J.

See generally Yousef et al. (2001) Endocrine Reviews 22:184-204.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nThis disclosure provides, inter alia, hK1 binding proteins. An “hK1 binding protein” refers to a protein that can interact with hK1 or a fragment thereof, particularly a protease-active fragment thereof. The hK1 binding proteins include antibodies that bind to hK1 with high affinity and antibody that can inhibit hK1 enzymatic activity. HK1 binding proteins can be administered to a subject, e.g., to treat disorders such as asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, interstitial cystitis, and a neoplastic disorder (e.g., metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas or tumor angiogenesis), or other hK1-associated disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the disclosure features a protein that binds to hK1 and that includes a heavy chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and a light chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. The protein can bind to or sterically occlude the active site of hK1. In one embodiment, the protein contacts one or more of the hK1 \nactive site residues\n 65, 120, or 214, or a residue within five amino acids of such residues. In one embodiment, the protein inhibits hK1 enzymatic activity.

In another embodiment, the protein prevents hK1 from interacting with a peptide substrate smaller than 12 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the protein is unable to bind an hK1 molecule that is inactivated by aprotinin or other protein protease inhibitors such as α1-antitrypsin or kallistatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the protein does not evoke an immunogenic response in humans.

The interval can be an interval of minutes, hours, days or weeks. Generally, the agents are concurrently bioavailable, e.g., detectable, in the subject. The first and second agents can be administered in either order. In a preferred embodiment at least one administration of one of the agents, e.g., the first agent, is made within minutes, one, two, three, or four hours, or even within one or two days of the other agent, e.g., the second agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the first and second agents are administered at the same time.

The method can include other features described herein.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” refers to a protein that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term “antibody” encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab′)\n2\n, a Fd fragment, a Fv fragments, and dAb fragments) as well as complete antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed “complementarity determining regions” (“CDR”), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed “framework regions” (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDR's has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917). Kabat definitions are used herein. Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDR's and four FR's, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “immunoglobulin domain” refers to a domain from the variable or constant domain of immunoglobulin molecules. Immunoglobulin domains typically contain two β-sheets formed of about seven β-strands, and a conserved disulphide bond (see, e.g., A. F. Williams and A. N. Barclay 1988 \nAnn. Rev Immunol. \n6:381-405). The canonical structures of hypervariable loops of an immunoglobulin variable can be inferred from its sequence, as described in Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; Tomlinson et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-798); and Tomlinson et al. (1995) EMBO J. 14(18):4628-38.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “immunoglobulin variable domain sequence” refers to an amino acid sequence which can form the structure of an immunoglobulin variable domain. For example, the sequence may include all or part of the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring variable domain. For example, the sequence may omit one, two or more N- or C-terminal amino acids, internal amino acids, may include one or more insertions or additional terminal amino acids, or may include other alterations. In one embodiment, a polypeptide that includes immunoglobulin variable domain sequence can associate with another immunoglobulin variable domain sequence to form a target binding structure (or “antigen binding site”), e.g., a structure that interacts with hK1, e.g., binds to or inhibits hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VH or VL chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, wherein the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are inter-connected by, e.g., disulfide bonds. The heavy chain constant region includes three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The light chain constant region includes a CL domain. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. The term “antibody” includes intact immunoglobulins of types IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof). The light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. In one embodiment, the antibody is glycosylated. An antibody can be functional for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or complement-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more regions of an antibody can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the variable regions can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the CDRs can be human, e.g., HC CDR1, HC CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3. Each of the light chain CDRs can be human. HC CDR3 can be human. One or more of the framework regions can be human, e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4 of the HC or LC. In one embodiment, all the framework regions are human, e.g., derived from a human somatic cell, e.g., a hematopoietic cell that produces immunoglobulins or a non-hematopoietic cell. In one embodiment, the human sequences are germline sequences, e.g., encoded by a germline nucleic acid. One or more of the constant regions can be human or effectively human. In another embodiment, at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, or 98% of the framework regions (e.g., FR1, FR2, and FR3, collectively, or FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4, collectively) or the entire antibody can be human or effectively human. For example, FR1, FR2, and FR3 collectively can be at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% identical to a human sequence encoded by a human germline VH segment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll or part of an antibody can be encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or a segment thereof. Exemplary human immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA1 and IgA2), gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin “light chains” (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin “heavy chains” (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, e.g., gamma (encoding about 330 amino acids).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antigen-binding fragment” of a full length antibody (or simply “antibody portion,” or “fragment”), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target of interest. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term “antigen-binding fragment” of a full length antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) that retains functionality. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv (scFv). See e.g., Bird et al. (1988) \nScience \n242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:5879-5883.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody fragments can be obtained using any appropriate technique including conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art. The term “monospecific antibody” refers to an antibody that displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular target, e.g., epitope. This term includes a “monoclonal antibody” or “monoclonal antibody composition,” which as used herein refer to a preparation of antibodies or fragments thereof of single molecular composition. As used herein, “isotype” refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgG1) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “effectively human” immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that includes a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. An “effectively human” antibody is an antibody that includes a sufficient number of human amino acid positions such that the antibody does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “humanized” immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that is modified to include a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. Descriptions of “humanized” immunoglobulins include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “binding affinity” refers to the apparent association constant or K\na\n. The K\na \nis the reciprocal of the dissociation constant (K\nd\n). A binding protein may, for example, have a Kd of less than 10\n−5\n, 10\n−6\n, 10\n−7 \nor 10\n−8 \nM for a particular target molecule. Higher affinity binding of a binding ligand to a first target relative to a second target can be indicated by a higher K\na \n(or a smaller numerical value K\nd\n) for binding the first target than the K\na \n(or numerical value K\nd\n) for binding the second target. In such cases the binding protein has specificity for the first target (e.g., hK1) relative to the second target (e.g., a protein other than hK1, e.g., serum albumin, laminin, or a globin). Differences in binding affinity (e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 70, 80, 100, 500, 1000, or 10\n5 \nfold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding affinity can be determined by a variety of methods including equilibrium dialysis, equilibrium binding, gel filtration, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, or spectroscopy (e.g., using a fluorescence assay). Exemplary conditions for evaluating binding affinity are in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at pH 7.2 at 30° C. These techniques can be used to measure the concentration of bound and free binding protein as a function of binding protein (or target) concentration. The concentration of bound binding protein ([Bound]) is related to the concentration of free binding protein ([Free]) and the concentration of binding sites for the binding protein on the target where (N) is the number of binding sites per target molecule by the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \n[Bound]=\nN\n·[Free]/((1\n/Ka\n)+[Free]).\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is not always necessary to make an exact determination of Ka, though, since sometimes it is sufficient to obtain a quantitative measurement of affinity, e.g., determined using a method such as ELISA or FACS analysis, is proportional to Ka, and thus can be used for comparisons, such as determining whether a higher affinity is, e.g., 2-fold higher, to obtain a qualitative measurement of affinity, or to obtain an inference of affinity, e.g., by activity in a functional assay, e.g., an in vitro or in vivo assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated composition” refers to a composition that is removed from at least 90% of at least one component of a natural sample from which the isolated composition can be obtained. Compositions produced artificially or naturally can be “compositions of at least” a certain degree of purity if the species or population of species of interests is at least 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% pure on a weight-weight basis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “epitope” refers to the site on a target compound that is bound by a binding protein (e.g., an antibody such as a Fab or full length antibody). In the case where the target compound is a protein, the site can be entirely composed of amino acid components, entirely composed of chemical modifications of amino acids of the protein (e.g., glycosyl moieties), or composed of combinations thereof. Overlapping epitopes include at least one common amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalculations of “homology” or “sequence identity” between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The optimal alignment is determined as the best score using the GAP program in the GCG software package with a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “identity” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “homology”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. For example, the reference sequence may be the length of the immunoglobulin variable domain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “substantially identical” (or “substantially homologous”) is used herein to refer to a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that contains a sufficient number of identical or equivalent (e.g., with a similar side chain, e.g., conserved amino acid substitutions) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleic acid sequences have (or encode proteins having) similar activities, e.g., a binding activity, a binding preference, or a biological activity. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least 50% of the affinity relative to the same antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences similar or homologous (e.g., at least about 85% sequence identity) to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of this application. In some embodiment, the sequence identity can be about 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. In addition, substantial identity exists when the nucleic acid segments hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., highly stringent hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “hybridizes under low stringency, medium stringency, high stringency, or very high stringency conditions” describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is incorporated by reference. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: (1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by two washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50° C. (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55° C. for low stringency conditions); (2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C.; (3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6× SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C.; and (4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65° C., followed by one or more washes at 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65° C. Very high stringency conditions (4) are the preferred conditions and the ones that should be used unless otherwise specified. The invention includes nucleic acids that hybridize with low, medium, high, or very high stringency to a nucleic acid described herein or to a complement thereof, e.g., nucleic acids encoding a binding protein described herein. The nucleic acids can be the same length or within 30, 20, or 10% of the length of the reference nucleic acid. The nucleic acid can correspond to a region encoding an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn hK1 binding protein may have mutations relative to a binding protein described herein (e.g., a conservative or non-essential amino acid substitutions), which do not have a substantial effect on the protein functions. Whether or not a particular substitution will be tolerated, e.g., will not adversely affect biological properties, such as binding activity can be predicted, e.g., using the method of Bowie, et al. (1990) \nScience \n247:1306-1310.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). It is possible for many framework and CDR amino acid residues to include one or more conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsensus sequences for biopolymers can include positions which can be varied among various amino acids. For example, the symbol “X” in such a context generally refers to any amino acid (e.g., any of the twenty natural amino acids or any of the nineteen non-cysteine amino acids). Other allowed amino acids can also be indicated for example, using parentheses and slashes. For example, “(A/W/F/N/Q)” means that alanine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, asparagine, and glutamine are allowed at that particular position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of the binding agent, e.g., the antibody, without abolishing or more preferably, without substantially altering a biological activity, whereas an “essential” amino acid residue results in such a change.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polypeptide” or “peptide” (which may be used interchangeably) refer to a polymer of three or more amino acids linked by a peptide bond, e.g., between 3 and 60, or 30 and 300, or over 300 amino acids in length. The polypeptide may include one or more unnatural amino acids. Typically, the polypeptide includes only natural amino acids. A “protein” can include one or more polypeptide chains. Accordingly, the term “protein” encompasses polypeptides. A protein or polypeptide can also include one or more modifications, e.g., a glycosylation, amidation, phosphorylation, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cognate substrate” refers to a naturally occurring substrate of hK1, including naturally occurring variants thereof (e.g., splice variants, naturally occurring mutants, and isoforms).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “common codon” refers to the most common codon representing a particular amino acid in sequences of the species of cell that is used to express the protein. “Less-common codons” are codons that occurs frequently in the particular species but are not the common codon. All codons other than common codons and less-common codons are “non-common codons”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “hK1-associated inflammatory disorder” refers to a disorder characterized by an inflammatory response mediated at least in part by hK1, e.g., the protease activity of hK1. For such disorders, a reduction in hK1 activity results in a reduced inflammatory response. Exemplary hK1-associated inflammatory disorders include asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, and interstitial cystitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical significance can be determined by any art known method. Exemplary statistical tests include: the Students T-test, Mann Whitney U non-parametric test, and Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test. Some statistically significant relationships have a P value of less than 0.05 or 0.02. Particular binding proteins may show a difference, e.g., in specificity, binding, or biological activity, that are statistically significant (e.g., P value<0.05 or 0.02). The terms “induce”, “inhibit”, “potentiate”, “elevate”, “increase”, “decrease” or the like, e.g., which denote distinguishable qualitative or quantitative differences between two states, and may refer to a difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference, between the two states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n. Epitope grouping by SPR. Biotinylated hK1 was captured on a streptavidin coated chip to a final ligand density of 88 RU. DX-2300 was injected over immobilized hK1 at a concentration of 50 nM followed by an injection of a second Fab at a concentration of 50 nM at a flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25° C. in PBST using a Biacore 3000 instrument. The signal at the end of the injection of DX-2300 followed by a second Fab is R1. The signal at the end of the injection of the Fab alone is R2. Panel A shows the sensorgram for a Fab (M0112-D07) that binds the same epitope as DX-2300. Panel B shows the sensorgram for a Fab (M0139-A09) that bind a different epitope as DX-2300.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n. Inhibition mechanism of DX-2300 (also referred to herein as “M0131-F07”). The inhibition mechanism of DX-2300 as a Fab (panel A) is shown to be competitive and to have a K\ni \nof 60±2 pM. The inhibition mechanism of DX-2300 as an IgG (panel B) is shown to be competitive and to have a K\ni \nof 39±4 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n. Inhibition mechanisms of other hK1 inhibitors. The inhibition mechanism of M0093-F09 as a Fab (panel A) is shown to be noncompetitive and to have a K\ni \nof 1.9 nM. The inhibition mechanism of M0137-E01 as a Fab (panel B) is shown to be competitive and to have a K\ni \nof 0.9 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n. Progress Curve Analysis of DX-2300. Kinetic progress curves (panel A) in the presence of increasing amounts of DX-2300 inhibitor were fit to the following equation to obtain kobs values, F=v\ns\n+(v\n0\n−v\ns\n) (1−exp(−k\nobs\n*t)/k\nobs\n+C, where F=fluorescence, v\ns\n=final steady state rate, v\n0\n=initial steady state rate, k\nobs\n=exponential inhibition constant, t=time in seconds, and C is a constant to account for the initial background fluorescence at t=0 seconds. In panel B the k\nobs \nvalues were plotted against inhibitor concentrations and fit to an equation for a slow, tight binder with an isomerization step: k\nobs\n=k\n6\n+(k\n5\n*[I]/(K\ni,app\n+[I])), where k\n6 \nis the reverse reaction rate constant for the enzyme-inhibitor isomerization step, k\n5 \nis the forward reaction rate constant for that step, K\ni,app \nis the apparent equilibrium inhibition constant for the formation of the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex, and [I] is the concentration of inhibitor present in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n. DX-2300 inhibition of kallikrein-like activity in animal urine. Kallikein-like activity in animal was measured as described above. The percent inhibition is ratio of the initial rate observed in the presence of DX-2300 (R\ninhibited\n) to that observed in its absence (R\no\n) such that Percent Inhibition=100−(R\no\n−R\ninhibited\n)/R\no\n*100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n. Determination of DX-2300 IC\n50 \nof kallikrein-like activity in human and sheep urine. Measurements of kallikrein activity in activated urine were performed as described above in the presence or absence of a varied concentration of DX-2300. The measured DX-2300 IC\n50 \nvalues for kallikrein-like activity in sheep urine and human urine are comparable at 2.9±1.6 nM and 3.0±0.6 nM, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n. Inhibition of kallikrein-like activity in human BAL from mild asthmatic patients following a rhinovirus infection. Kallikrein activity in BAL was measured in 80 μL BAL using 100 μM Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate in KAL buffer (Table 4) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM DX-2300. Prior to the addition of substrate the BAL was incubated with DX-2300 for 30 minutes at 30° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n. Effect of DX-2300 on antigen-induced airway responses in the sheep. Sheep (n=2) were administered 10 mg of DX-2300 by inhalation 12 hours and 30 minutes prior to challenge with the \nAscaris suum \nallergen. Panel A compares DX-2300 treated animals (squares) to control animals (diamonds) by measuring pulmonary resistance over 8 hours following allergen challenge. Panel B compares the airway hyper-responsiveness to carbachol administered 24 hours post challenge observed in DX-2300 treated animals to control animals. The open bars indicate the amount of carbachol required to induce \nbronchoconstriction\n 400% above baseline prior to allergen challenge. The filled bars indicate the amount of carbachol required to induce \nbronchoconstriction\n 400% above baseline 24 hours after allergen challenge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n. Effect of DX-2300 on high molecular weight kininogen induced bronchoconstriction in the sheep model of asthma.

A hK1 binding protein described herein can be used to modulate such substrates, e.g., to reduce proteolytic cleavage of such substrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies that bind to hK1 can be obtained by using hK1 as an antigen, e.g., for immunizing an animal, or as a target, e.g., for screening a library of recombinant antibodies. Peptides and fragments of hK1 can also be used.\n\n\n \nDisplay Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a display library is used to identify proteins that bind to hK1. A display library is a collection of entities; each entity includes an accessible protein component (e.g., a Fab or scFv) and a recoverable component (e.g., a nucleic acid) that encodes or identifies the protein component. The protein component can be of any length, e.g. from three amino acids to over 300 amino acids. In a selection, the protein component of each member of the library is contacted to hK1 and if the protein component binds to hK1, the display library member is identified, e.g., by retention on a support. The protein component can include one or more immunoglobulin variable domains or variants of another domain. Methods using immunoglobulin domains for display are described below (see, e.g., “Antibody Display Libraries”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRetained display library members are recovered from the support and analyzed. The analysis can include amplification and a subsequent selection under similar or dissimilar conditions. For example, positive and negative selections can be alternated. The analysis can also include determining the amino acid sequence of the protein component and purification of the protein component for detailed characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of formats can be used for display libraries. Examples include the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage Display. One format utilizes viruses, particularly bacteriophages. This format is termed “phage display.” The protein component is typically covalently linked to a bacteriophage coat protein. The linkage results form translation of a nucleic acid encoding the protein component fused to the coat protein. The linkage can include a flexible peptide linker, a protease site, or an amino acid incorporated as a result of suppression of a stop codon. Phage display is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-1317; WO 92/18619; WO 91/17271; WO 92/20791; WO 92/15679; WO 93/01288; WO 92/01047; WO 92/09690; WO 90/02809; de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol.

(1992) \nHum Antibod Hybridomas \n3:81-85; Huse et al. (1989) \nScience \n246:1275-1281; Griffiths et al. (1993) \nEMBO J. \n12:725-734; Hawkins et al.

(1996) \nMethods Enzymol. \n267:129-49; Hoogenboom et al. (1991) \nNuc Acid Res \n19:4133-4137; and Barbas et al. (1991) \nPNAS \n88:7978-7982.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display systems have been developed for filamentous phage (phage f1, fd, and M13) as well as other bacteriophage (e.g. T7 bacteriophage and lambdoid phages; see, e.g., Santini (1998) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n282:125-135; Rosenberg et al. (1996) \nInnovations \n6:1-6; Houshmet al. (1999) \nAnal Biochem \n268:363-370). The filamentous phage display systems typically use fusions to a minor coat protein, such as gene III protein, and gene VIII protein, a major coat protein, but fusions to other coat proteins such as gene VI protein, gene VII protein, gene IX protein, or domains thereof can also been used (see, e.g., WO 00/71694). In one embodiment, the fusion is to a domain of the gene III protein, e.g., the anchor domain or “stump,” (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,727 for a description of the gene III protein anchor domain). It is also possible to physically associate the protein being displayed to the coat using a non-peptide linkage, e.g., a non-covalent bond or a non-peptide covalent bond. For example, a disulfide bond and/or c-fos and c-jun coiled-coils can be used for physical associations (see, e.g., Crameri et al. (1993) Gene 137:69 and WO 01/05950).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacteriophage displaying the protein component can be grown and harvested using standard phage preparatory methods, e.g. PEG precipitation from growth media. After selection of individual display phages, the nucleic acid encoding the selected protein components can be isolated from cells infected with the selected phages or from the phage themselves, after amplification. Individual colonies or plaques can be picked, the nucleic acid isolated and sequenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Display Formats. Other display formats include cell based display (see, e.g., WO 03/029456), protein-nucleic acid fusions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,446), and ribosome display (See, e.g., Mattheakis et al. (1994) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:9022 and Hanes et al. (2000) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n18:1287-92; Hanes et al. (2000) \nMethods Enzymol. \n328:404-30; and Schaffitzel et al. (1999) \nJ Immunol Methods. \n231(1-2):119-35).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpitope Specific Binding proteins. Display technology can also be used to obtain binding proteins, e.g., antibodies, that bind to particular epitopes of a target. Epitopes can be classified as “conformational” or “sequential”. Conformational epitopes involve amino-acid residues that have a defined relative orientation in a properly folded target even though the amino acids may be substantially separated in the sequence (e.g., separated by at least one, two, four, six, eight or ten amino acids). Sequential epitopes involve short portions of the polypeptide chain that bind an antibody whatever the folding state of the protein (e.g., native or unfolded). Binding proteins for conformational epitopes can be identified, for example, by using competing non-target molecules that lack the particular epitope or are mutated within the epitope, e.g., with alanine. Such non-target molecules can be used in a negative selection procedure as described below, as competing molecules when binding a display library to the target, or as a pre-elution agent, e.g., to capture in a wash solution dissociating display library members that are not specific to the target. In another implementation, epitope specific binding proteins are identified by eluting display library members with a competing binding protein that binds to the epitope of interest on the target molecule. Binding proteins that bind sequential epitopes can be selected, for example, using short peptides that have amino-acid sequences found in a target protein. Often binding proteins that bind to conformational epitopes also bind weakly to one or another peptide that contains some of the amino acids involved in the conformational epitope. Thus, one can select for binding to a peptide at very low stringency and then select for binding to the folded target protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAffinity Maturation. In one embodiment, a binding protein that binds to a target is modified, e.g., by mutagenesis, to provide a pool of modified binding proteins. The modified binding proteins are then evaluated to identify one or more altered binding proteins which have altered functional properties (e.g., improved binding, improved stability, lengthened stability in vivo). In one implementation, display library technology is used to select or screen the pool of modified binding proteins. Higher affinity binding proteins are then identified from the second library, e.g., by using higher stringency or more competitive binding and washing conditions. Other screening techniques can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some implementations, the mutagenesis is targeted to regions known or likely to be at the binding interface. If, for example, the identified binding proteins are antibodies, then mutagenesis can be directed to the CDR regions of the heavy or light chains as described herein. Further, mutagenesis can be directed to framework regions near or adjacent to the CDRs, e.g., framework regions, particular within ten, five, or three amino acids of a CDR junction. In the case of antibodies, mutagenesis can also be limited to one or a few of the CDRs, e.g., to make step-wise improvements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to make an antibody more similar to one or more germline sequences. One exemplary germlining method can include: identifying one or more germline sequences that are similar (e.g., most similar in a particular database) to the sequence of the isolated antibody. Then mutations (at the amino acid level) can be made in the isolated antibody, either incrementally, in combination, or both. For example, a nucleic acid library that includes sequences encoding some or all possible germline mutations is made. The mutated antibodies are then evaluated, e.g., to identify an antibody that has one or more additional germline residues relative to the isolated antibody and that is still useful (e.g., has a functional activity). In one embodiment, as many germline residues are introduced into an isolated antibody as possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to substitute or insert one or more germline residues into a CDR region. For example, the germline CDR residue can be from a germline sequence that is similar (e.g., most similar) to the variable region being modified. After mutagenesis, activity (e.g., binding or other functional activity) of the antibody can be evaluated to determine if the germline residue or residues are tolerated. Similar mutagenesis can be performed in the framework regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelecting a germline sequence can be performed in different ways. For example, a germline sequence can be selected if it meets a predetermined criteria for selectivity or similarity, e.g., at least a certain percentage identity, e.g., at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 99.5% identity. The selection can be performed using at least 2, 3, 5, or 10 germline sequences. In the case of CDR1 and CDR2, identifying a similar germline sequence can include selecting one such sequence. In the case of CDR3, identifying a similar germline sequence can include selecting one such sequence, but may including using two germline sequences that separately contribute to the amino-terminal portion and the carboxy-terminal portion. In other implementations more than one or two germline sequences are used, e.g., to form a consensus sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, with respect to a particular reference variable domain sequence, e.g., a sequence described herein, a related variable domain sequence has at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 100% of the CDR amino acid positions that are not identical to residues in the reference CDR sequences, residues that are identical to residues at corresponding positions in a human germline sequence (i.e., an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline nucleic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, with respect to a particular reference variable domain sequence, e.g., a sequence described herein, a related variable domain sequence has at least 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% of the FR regions are identical to FR sequence from a human germline sequence, e.g., a germline sequence related to the reference variable domain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is possible to isolate an antibody which has similar activity to a given antibody of interest, but is more similar to one or more germline sequences, particularly one or more human germline sequences. For example, an antibody can be at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.5% identical to a germline sequence in a region outside the CDRs (e.g., framework regions). Further an antibody can include at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 germline residues in a CDR region, the germline residue being from a germline sequence of similar (e.g., most similar) to the variable region being modified. Germline sequences of primary interest are human germline sequences. The activity of the antibody (e.g., the binding activity) can be within a factor or 100, 10, 5, 2, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.001 of the original antibody. An exemplary germline sequences include VKI-O2, VL2-1, VKII1-L2::JK2, vg3-23, V3-23::JH4, and V3-23::JK6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome exemplary mutagenesis techniques include: error-prone PCR (Leung et al. (1989) \nTechnique \n1:11-15), recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Ser. No. 10/279,633), DNA shuffling using random cleavage (Stemmer (1994) \nNature \n389-391; termed “nucleic acid shuffling”), RACHITT™ (Coco et al. (2001) \nNature Biotech. \n19:354), site-directed mutagenesis (Zoller et al. (1987) \nNucl Acids Res \n10:6487-6504), cassette mutagenesis (Reidhaar-Olson (1991) \nMethods Enzymol. \n208:564-586) and incorporation of degenerate oligonucleotides (Griffiths et al. (1994) \nEMBO J \n13:3245).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example of affinity maturation the methods described herein are used to first identify a binding protein from a display library that binds an hK1 with at least a minimal binding specificity for a target or a minimal activity, e.g., an equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of less than 1 nM, 10 nM, or 100 nM. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the initial identified binding protein are used as a template nucleic acid for the introduction of variations, e.g., to identify a second binding protein that has enhanced properties (e.g., binding affinity, kinetics, or stability) relative to the initial binding protein. Alternatively, the amino-acid sequence of one or more CDRs can be used as a guide for design of a nucleic acid library that includes nucleic acids encoding the isolated sequence and many neighboring sequences. Such diversified nucleic acids can be introduced into a display vector containing the initial isolate and improved variants are selected from the library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOff-Rate Selection. Since a slow dissociation rate can be predictive of high affinity, particularly with respect to interactions between polypeptides and their targets, the methods described herein can be used to isolate binding proteins with a desired kinetic dissociation rate (i.e. reduced) for a binding interaction to a target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo select for slow dissociating binding proteins from a display library, the library is contacted to an immobilized target. The immobilized target is then washed with a first solution that removes non-specifically or weakly bound biomolecules. Then the immobilized target is eluted with a second solution that includes a saturation amount of free target, e.g., replicates of the target that are not attached to the particle. The free target binds to biomolecules that dissociate from the target. Rebinding is effectively prevented by the saturating amount of free target relative to the much lower concentration of immobilized target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second solution can have solution conditions that are substantially physiological or that are stringent. Typically, the solution conditions of the second solution are identical to the solution conditions of the first solution. Fractions of the second solution are collected in temporal order to distinguish early from late fractions. Later fractions include biomolecules that dissociate at a slower rate from the target than biomolecules in the early fractions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, it is also possible to recover display library members that remain bound to the target even after extended incubation. These can either be dissociated using chaotropic conditions or can be amplified while attached to the target. For example, phage bound to the target can be contacted to bacterial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelecting and Screening for Specificity. “Selection”, in the context of a display library, refers to a process in which many members of a display library are allowed to contact the target and those that bind are recovered and propagated. The selection can be from a library having numerous members, e.g., more than 10\n10 \nmembers. “Screening”, in the context of a display library, refers to a process in which isolated members of the library are tested singly for binding to the target. Through automation, thousands of candidates may be screened in a highly parallel process. The display library selection methods described herein can include a selection process that discards display library members that bind to a non-target molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of non-target molecules, e.g., for an hK1 binding antibody, include, e.g., proteases other hK1, e.g., kallikreins other than hK1, e.g., hK2, hK3 hK4, hK5, hK6, hK7, hK8, hK9, hK10, hK11, hK12, hK13, hK14, or hK15. Useful hK1 binding antibodies may be specific for a subset of kallikreins, e.g., they may interact with a plurality of kallikreins, at least one of which is hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one implementation, a so-called “negative selection” step is used to discriminate between the target and related non-target molecule and a related, but distinct non-target molecule. The display library or a pool thereof is contacted to the non-target molecule. Members of the sample that do not bind the non-target are collected and used in subsequent selections for binding to the target molecule or even for subsequent negative selections. The negative selection step can be prior to or after selecting library members that bind to the target molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another implementation, a screening step is used. After display library members are isolated for binding to the target molecule, each isolated library member is tested for its ability to bind to a non-target molecule (e.g., a non-target listed above). For example, a high-throughput ELISA screen can be used to obtain this data. The ELISA screen can also be used to obtain quantitative data for binding of each library member to the target. The non-target and target binding data are compared (e.g., using a computer and software) to identify library members that specifically bind to hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe display library selection and screening methods described herein can include a selection or screening process that selects for display library members that bind to specific sites on the target molecule. For example, elution with high concentration of an antibody described herein selects for phage that bind to the epitope bound by such an antibody. One can screen for a phage that binds to a particular epitope of hK1 by performing ELISAs with and without a competing antibody that recognizes the epitope in the buffer.\n\n\n \nAntibody Display Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the display library presents a diverse pool of proteins, each of which includes at least one and typically two immunoglobulin variable domains. Display libraries are particular useful, for example, for identifying human or effectively human antibodies that recognize human antigens. Since the constant and framework regions of the antibody are human, these therapeutic antibodies may avoid themselves being recognized and targeted as antigens. The constant regions are also optimized to recruit effector functions of the human immune system. The in vitro display selection process surmounts the inability of a normal human immune system to generate antibodies against self-antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA typical antibody display library displays a protein that includes a VH domain and a VL domain. The display library can display the antibody as a Fab fragment (e.g., using two polypeptide chains) or a single chain Fv (e.g., using a single polypeptide chain). Other formats can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs in the case of the Fab and other formats, the displayed antibody can include a constant region as part of a light or heavy chain. In one embodiment, each chain includes one constant region, e.g., as in the case of a Fab. In other embodiments, additional constant regions are displayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody libraries can be constructed by a number of processes (see, e.g., de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:18218-30; Hoogenboom et al. (1998) \nImmunotechnology \n4:1-20; Hoogenboom et al. (2000) \nImmunol Today \n21:371-8; US 2003-0232333 and US 2004-0029113). Further, elements of each process can be combined with those of other processes. The processes can be used such that variation is introduced into a single immunoglobulin domain (e.g., VH or VL) or into multiple immunoglobulin domains (e.g., VH and VL). The variation can be introduced into an immunoglobulin variable domain, e.g., in the region of one or more of CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4, referring to such regions of either and both of heavy and light chain variable domains. In one embodiment, variation is introduced into all three CDRs of a given variable domain. In another preferred embodiment, the variation is introduced into CDR1 and CDR2, e.g., of a heavy chain variable domain. Any combination is feasible. In one process, antibody libraries are constructed by inserting diverse oligonucleotides that encode CDRs into the corresponding regions of the nucleic acid encoding the display protein or portion thereof. The oligonucleotides can be synthesized using a variety of subunits, e.g., monomeric nucleotides or trinucleotides. For example, Knappik et al. (2000) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57-86 describe a method for constructing CDR encoding oligonucleotides using trinucleotide synthesis and a template with engineered restriction sites for accepting the oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another process, an animal, e.g., a rodent, is immunized with the hK1. The animal is optionally boosted with the antigen to further stimulate the response. Then spleen cells are isolated from the animal, and nucleic acid encoding VH and/or VL domains is amplified and cloned for expression in the display library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another process, antibody libraries are constructed from nucleic acid amplified from naïve germline immunoglobulin genes (e.g., human genes). The amplified nucleic acid includes nucleic acid encoding the VH and/or VL domain. Sources of immunoglobulin-encoding nucleic acids are described below. Amplification can include PCR, e.g., with primers that anneal to the conserved constant region, or another amplification method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding immunoglobulin domains or fragments thereof can be obtained from the immune cells of, e.g., a human, a primate, mouse, rabbit, camel, or rodent. Cells can be selected for a particular property. For example, B cells at various stages of maturity, including naïve B cells, can be selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) can be used to sort B cells that express surface-bound IgM, IgD, or IgG molecules. Further, B cells expressing different isotypes of IgG can be isolated. B and T cells can be cultured and stimulated in vitro, e.g., by culturing with feeder cells or by adding mitogens or other modulatory reagents, such as antibodies to CD40, CD40 ligand or CD20, phorbol myristate acetate, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, phytohaemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells can also be isolated from a subject that has an immunological disorder, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, or anti-phospholipid syndrome. The subject can be a human, or an animal, e.g., an animal model for the human disease, or an animal having an analogous disorder. Cells can be isolated from a transgenic non-human animal that includes a human immunoglobulin locus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells can have activated a program of somatic hypermutation. Cells can be stimulated to undergo somatic mutagenesis of immunoglobulin genes, for example, by treatment with anti-immunoglobulin, anti-CD40, and anti-CD38 antibodies (see, e.g., Bergthorsdottir et al. (2001) \nJ Immunol. \n166:2228). In another embodiment, the cells are naïve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid encoding an immunoglobulin variable domain can be isolated from a natural repertoire by the following exemplary method. First, RNA is isolated from the immune cell. Full length (e.g., capped) mRNAs are separated (e.g. by dephosphorylating uncapped RNAs with calf intestinal phosphatase). The cap is then removed with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase and reverse transcription is used to produce the cDNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reverse transcription of the first (antisense) strand can be done in any manner with any suitable primer. See, e.g., de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:18218-30. The primer binding region can be constant among different immunoglobulins, e.g., in order to reverse transcribe different isotypes of immunoglobulin. The primer binding region can also be specific to a particular isotype of immunoglobulin. Typically, the primer is specific for a region that is 3′ to a sequence encoding at least one CDR. In another embodiment, poly-dT primers may be used (and may be preferred for the heavy-chain genes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA synthetic sequence can be ligated to the 3′ end of the reverse transcribed strand. The synthetic sequence can be used as a primer binding site for binding of the forward primer during PCR amplification after reverse transcription. The use of the synthetic sequence can obviate the need to use a pool of different forward primers to fully capture the available diversity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable domain-encoding gene is then amplified, e.g., using one or more rounds. If multiple rounds are used, nested primers can be used for increased fidelity. The amplified nucleic acid is then cloned into a display library vector.\n\n\n \nAntibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nSome antibodies, e.g., Fabs, can be produced in bacterial cells, e.g., \nE. coli \ncells. For example, if the Fab is encoded by sequences in a phage display vector that includes a suppressible stop codon between the display entity and a bacteriophage protein (or fragment thereof), the vector nucleic acid can be shuffled into a bacterial cell that cannot suppress a stop codon. In this case, the Fab is not fused to the gene III protein and is secreted into the media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can also be produced in eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the antibodies (e.g., scFv's) are expressed in a yeast cell such as \nPichia \n(see, e.g., Powers et al. (2001) \nJ Immunol Methods. \n251:123-35), \nHanseula\n, or \nSaccharomyces. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, antibodies, particularly full length antibodies, e.g., IgG's, are produced in mammalian cells. Exemplary mammalian host cells for recombinant expression include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr-CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin (1980) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp (1982) \nMol. Biol. \n159:601-621), lymphocytic cell lines, e.g., NS0 myeloma cells and SP2 cells, COS cells, K562, and a cell from a transgenic animal, e.g., a transgenic mammal. For example, the cell is a mammary epithelial cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the immunoglobulin domain, the recombinant expression vectors may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017). Exemplary selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr\n−\n host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary system for recombinant expression of an antibody (e.g., a full length antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof), a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr-CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements (e.g., derived from SV40, CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element) to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells, and recover the antibody from the culture medium. For example, some antibodies can be isolated by affinity chromatography with a Protein A or Protein G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor antibodies that include an Fc domain, the antibody production system may synthesize antibodies in which the Fc region is glycosylated. For example, the Fc domain of IgG molecules is glycosylated at asparagine 297 in the CH2 domain. This asparagine is the site for modification with biantennary-type oligosaccharides. This glycosylation participates in effector functions mediated by Fey receptors and complement C1q (Burton and Woof (1992) \nAdv. Immunol. \n51:1-84; Jefferis et al. (1998) \nImmunol. Rev. \n163:59-76). The Fc domain can be produced in a mammalian expression system that appropriately glycosylates the residue corresponding to asparagine 297. The Fc domain can also include other eukaryotic post-translational modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies may also include modifications, e.g., that alter Fe function. For example, the human IgG1 constant region can be mutated at one or more residues, e.g., one or more of residues 234 and 237, e.g., according to the number in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260. Other exemplary modifications include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can also be produced by a transgenic animal. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,992 describes a method for expressing an antibody in the mammary gland of a transgenic mammal. A transgene is constructed that includes a milk-specific promoter and nucleic acids encoding the antibody of interest and a signal sequence for secretion. The milk produced by females of such transgenic mammals includes, secreted-therein, the antibody of interest. The antibody can be purified from the milk, or for some applications, used directly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to produce antibodies that bind to hK1 by immunization, e.g., using an animal, e.g., with natural, human, or partially human immunoglobulin loci. In one embodiment, the non-human animal includes at least a part of a human immunoglobulin gene. For example, it is possible to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the genes with the desired specificity may be produced and selected. See, e.g., XenoMouse™, Green et al. Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994), U.S. 2003-0070185, and WO 96/34096.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll or part of hK1 can be used as an immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-human antibodies can also be modified to include substitutions that insert human immunoglobulin sequences, e.g., consensus human amino acid residues at particular positions, e.g., at one or more of the following positions (preferably at least five, ten, twelve, or all): (in the FR of the variable domain of the light chain) 4L, 35L, 36L, 38L, 43L, 44L, 58L, 46L, 62L, 63L, 64L, 65L, 66L, 67L, 68L, 69L, 70L, 71L, 73L, 85L, 87L, 98L, and/or (in the FR of the variable domain of the heavy chain) 2H, 4H, 24H, 36H, 37H, 39H, 43H, 45H, 49H, 58H, 60H, 67H, 68H, 69H, 70H, 73H, 74H, 75H, 78H, 91H, 92H, 93H, and/or 103H (according to the Kabat numbering). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213.\n\n\n \nExemplary Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an hK1 binding antibody described herein includes one or more human framework sequences, e.g., a human or effectively human FR1, FR2, FR3, and/or FR4 in the heavy and/or light chain variable domain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one implementation the heavy chain variable domain sequence has H1 and H2 hypervariable loops have the 1-3 canonical structures according to Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; Tomlinson et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-798). Exemplary frameworks which are compatible with these structures include the following sequences for FR1, FR2, and FR3 respectively:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTALYYCAKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGLVKPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGVVRPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTALYHCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVKPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLLESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGVVVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNSKNSLYLQMNSLRTEDTALYYCAKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, frameworks from any human germline antibody sequences that are compatible with a 1-3 canonical structure can be used for the heavy chain. Similarly, light chain frameworks can be selected from compatible human germline antibody sequences for respectively light chain CDRs. Frameworks from VH or VL segments can be used for FR1, FR2, and FR3.\n\n\n \nTarget Protein Production\n\n\n \n \n \nhK1 can be produced by recombinant expression techniques, e.g., expression in \nE. coli \nor \nPichia pastoris\n. Human kallikrein hK1 can also be purified to homogeneity from urine essentially as described in Irie et al. (1986) Biochem. Int. 13, 375-382.\n\n\n \nBinding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nELISA. Proteins, e.g., antibodies that may interact with hK1(1, can be evaluated for an interaction property, e.g., a binding property using an ELISA assay. For example, each protein is contacted to a microtitre plate whose bottom surface has been coated with the target, e.g., a limiting amount of the target. The plate is washed with buffer to remove non-specifically bound polypeptides. Then the amount of the protein bound to the plate is determined by probing the plate with an antibody that can recognize the polypeptide, e.g., a tag or constant portion of the polypeptide. The antibody is linked to an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, which produces a colorimetric product when appropriate substrates are provided. The protein can be purified from cells or assayed in a display library format, e.g., as a fusion to a filamentous bacteriophage coat. Alternatively, cells (e.g., live or fixed) that express the target molecule, e.g., hK1, can be plated in a microtitre plate and used to test the affinity of the peptides/antibodies present in the display library or obtained by selection from the display library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another version of the ELISA assay, each polypeptide of a diversity strand library is used to coat a different well of a microtitre plate. The ELISA then proceeds using a constant target molecule to query each well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomogeneous Binding Assays. The binding interaction of candidate protein with a target can be analyzed using a homogenous assay, e.g., after all components of the assay are added, additional fluid manipulations are not required. For example, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used as a homogenous assay (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first molecule (e.g., the molecule identified in the fraction) is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy can be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second molecule (e.g., the target) if the second molecule is in proximity to the first molecule. The fluorescent label on the second molecule fluoresces when it absorbs to the transferred energy. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the ‘acceptor’ molecule label in the assay should be maximal. A binding event that is configured for monitoring by FRET can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art (e.g., using a fluorimeter). By titrating the amount of the first or second binding molecule, a binding curve can be generated to estimate the equilibrium binding constant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of a homogenous assay is Alpha Screen (Packard Bioscience, Meriden Conn.). Alpha Screen uses two labeled beads. One bead generates singlet oxygen when excited by a laser. The other bead generates a light signal when singlet oxygen diffuses from the first bead and collides with it. The signal is only generated when the two beads are in proximity. One bead can be attached to the display library member, the other to the target. Signals are measured to determine the extent of binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe homogenous assays can be performed while the candidate protein is attached to the display library vehicle, e.g., a bacteriophage or using a candidate protein as free molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The binding interaction of a molecule isolated from a display library and a target can be analyzed using SPR. SPR or Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants. Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) of the BIA chip result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). The changes in the refractivity generate a detectable signal, which are measured as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. Methods for using SPR are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,640; Raether (1988) \nSurface Plasmons \nSpringer Verlag; Sjolander and Urbaniczky (1991) \nAnal. Chem. \n63:2338-2345; Szabo et al. (1995) \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n5:699-705 and on-line resources provide by BIAcore International AB (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInformation from SPR can be used to provide an accurate and quantitative measure of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n), and kinetic parameters, including K\non \nand K\noff\n, for the binding of a biomolecule to a target. Such data can be used to compare different biomolecules. For example, proteins encoded by nucleic acid selected from a library of diversity strands can be compared to identify individuals that have high affinity for the target or that have a slow K\noff\n. This information can also be used to develop structure-activity relationships (SAR). For example, the kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters of matured versions of a parent protein can be compared to the parameters of the parent protein. Variant amino acids at given positions can be identified that correlate with particular binding parameters, e.g., high affinity and slow K\noff\n. This information can be combined with structural modeling (e.g., using homology modeling, energy minimization, or structure determination by crystallography or NMR). As a result, an understanding of the physical interaction between the protein and its target can be formulated and used to guide other design processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein Arrays. Polypeptides identified from the display library can be immobilized on a solid support, for example, on a bead or an array. For a protein array, each of the polypeptides is immobilized at a unique address on a support. Typically, the address is a two-dimensional address. Protein arrays are described below (see, e.g., Diagnostics).\n\n\n \nBiological Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vitro biochemical assays can be used to evaluate inhibition of hK1 proteolysis. See, e.g., Bourgeois et al. (1997) \nJ. Biol. Chemistry \n272:29590-29595. Exemplary peptide substrates that can be used to monitor hK1 proteolysis include: Abz-FRSARQ-EDDnp, Abz-TFRSARQ-EDDnp, Abz-FTFRSARQ-EDDnp, Abz-AIKFFSAQ-EDDnp, Abz-VIAGRSLNPNQ-EDDnp, Abz-AMSRMSLSSFSVNRQ-EDDnp, Abz-AIKFFSRQ-EDDnp, and Abz-TFFSARQ-EDDnp, wherein Abz represents o-aminobenzoyl, and EDDnp represents N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine. The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides can be synthesized by classical solution methods; a glutamine can be positioned as the C-terminal residue. See, e.g., Hirata et al. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1, 299-308. Syntheses can be performed with Fmoc methodology using a multiple automated peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8, Shimadzu Co.). Intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrates can be prepared as 2 mM stock solutions in N,N-dimethylformamide and diluted with activation buffer. Substrate purity can be checked by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (TofSpec-E, Micromass) and by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column eluted with a 10-min linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.075% TFA at 2.0 ml/min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conditions for evaluating enzymatic kinetics are at 37° C. in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.02% IGEPAL (previously Nonidet P-40).\n\n\n \nAnimal Models\n\n\n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,911,988 describes an exemplary mouse model for asthma. The mouse model can be used to evaluate the ability of an hK1 binding protein that also recognizes the murine KLK1 protein. The mouse may also be modified to express hK1. The mouse is subjected to long-term repeated inhalations of allergen and can be used to evaluate the long term effect of allergic diseases in the lung, and to delineate the cells, mechanisms, molecules, and mediators involved in the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness of lung in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale BALB/c mice (6-8 wk) can be used and maintained under conventional conditions for the studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReagents: Crystalline OVA was obtained from Pierce Chem. Co. (Rockford, Ill.) aluminum potassium sulfate (alum) from Sigma Chem. Co. (St. Louis, Mo.), pyrogen-free distilled water from Baxter, Healthcare Corporation (Deerfield, Ill.), 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) from Lymphomed (Deerfield, Ill.) and TRAPPSOL™ HPB-L100 (aqueous hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin; 45 wt/vol % aqueous solution) from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc. (Gainesville, Fla.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllergen Immunization/Challenge Protocols: Mice received an i.p. injection of 0.2 ml (100 μg) of OVA with alum (J. Exp Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494). Different protocols may be used. For example, mice can be anesthetized with 0.2 ml i.p. of ketamine (0.44 mg/ml)/xylazine (6.3 mg/ml) in normal saline before receiving an intranasal (i.n.) dose of 100 μg OVA in 0.05 ml normal saline and an i.n. dose of 50 μg OVA in 0.05 ml normal saline separately on different days. To evaluate an hK1 binding protein, the protein can be administered with a test dosage of the hK1 binding protein, e.g., before the intranasal dose challenge, and compared to corresponding control mice that receive a control administration that does not include the hK1 binding protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistology. The trachea and left lung (the right lung is used for bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”)) are obtained and fixed in 10% neutral formaldehyde solution at room temperature for 6. about. 15 h. After being embedded in paraffin, the tissues are cut into 5 μm sections and can be processed with the different staining or immunolabling further. Discombe's eosinophil staining can be used for counting the cell numbers with the counterstain of methylene blue. The eosinophil number per unit airway area (2,200 μm\n2\n) can be determined by morphometry (J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 395-404; Am Rev Respir Dis. 1993; 147:448-456). Fibrosis can be identified with the Masson's trichrome staining. Airway mucus can be identified by the following staining method: methylene blue, hematoxylin and eosin, mucicarmine, alcian blue, and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction (Troyer, H., “Carbohydrates” in Principles and Techniques of Histochemistry, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, Mass., 1980: 89-121; Sheehan, D. C., et al., “Carbohydrates” in Theory and Practice of Histotechnology, Battle Press, Columbus, Ohio, 1980: 159-179). Mucin can be stained with mucicarmine solution; metanil yellow counterstain was employed. Acidic mucin and sulfated mucosubstances can be stained with alcian blue, pH 2.5; nuclear fast red counterstain can also used. Neutral and acidic mucosubstances were identified by alcian blue, pH 2.5, and PAS reaction. The degree of mucus plugging of the airways (0.5-0.8 mm in diameter) can also assessed by morphometry. The percent occlusion of airway diameter by mucus was classified on a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 4+. The histologic and morphometric analyses can be performed by individuals blinded to the protocol design.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary Function Testing. On day 28, 24 hours after the last i.n. administration of either normal saline or OVA, pulmonary mechanics to intravenous infusion of methacholine can be determined in mice in vivo by a plethysmographic method, e.g., as previously described (10, 1958; 192: 364-368; J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 64: 2318-2323; J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494), or using modifications thereof. At the completion of pulmonary function testing, each mouse can be exsanguinated by cardiac puncture and the lung tissue with trachea can be used for the further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBronchoalveolar Lavage. After tying off the left lung at the mainstem bronchus, the right lung can be lavaged three times with 0.4 ml of normal saline. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cells from a 0.05-ml aliquot of the pooled sample are counted using a hemocytometer and the remaining fluid centrifuged at 4° C. for 10 minutes at 200 g. The supernatant is stored at −70° C. until eicosanoid analysis is performed. After resuspension of the cell pellet in normal saline containing 10% bovine serum albumin (“BSA”), BAL cell smears can be made on glass slides. To stain eosinophils, dried slides are stained with Discombe's diluting fluid (0.05% aqueous eosin and 5% acetone (vol/vol) in distilled water; J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 1271-1287) for 5-8 minutes, rinsed with water for 0.5 minutes, and counterstained with 0.07% methylene blue for 2 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssay of Airway Mucus Glycoproteins. Mucus glycoproteins in BAL fluid are assayed by slot blotting and PAS staining (Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 160-164; Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 296-306). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-.mu·m pore size; Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, N.H.) are wetted in distilled water and then in normal saline before placement in a Minifold II 72-well slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The BAL fluid samples (0.05 ml) and aliquots (0.05-0.75 l) of a stock solution (2 mu·m/ml) of human respiratory mucin glycoprotein (Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 71-79) are blotted onto the nitro-cellulose membranes by water suction vacuum, and mucus glycoproteins are visualized by PAS reaction. Reflectance densitometry can be performed to quantitate the PAS staining. The integrated intensity of the PAS reactivity of the BAL samples can be quantitated by comparison to the standard curve for human respiratory mucin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunocytochemistry. Monoclonal antibody: CD11c (DAB method) and Mac1 (Beringer Mannheim, ABC method with Hitomouse Kit, Zymed) can be used to identify inflammatory cell types, e.g., dendric cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, in/around the areas of vasculatures, airways and fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,462,020 describes an exemplary mouse model for arthritis, the induced Type II Collagen Arthritis Mouse Model. The mouse model can be used to evaluate the effect of hK1 binding proteins on the histological, radiographic and clinical appearance of induced type II collagen arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutoimmune diseases cause significant and chronic morbidity and disability. Arthritis in its many forms is representative of a family of autoimmune diseases. In the clinical realm, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of the severe arthrodysplastic disease. RA is a progressive disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe histopathology of arthritic lesions occurring in murine CIA share enormous similarities to that of RA in human patients. Murine CIA is a useful model to study potential therapeutic treatments of RA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials and Methods Mice: DBA/1(2) male mice weighing 25 gms (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me. or B&K Universal, Kent Wash.) are used for this work. This strain of mouse is susceptible to CIA by the injection of heterologous type II collagen. Bovine Collagen (BC), Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (ICFA) can be obtained from Sigma Chemical. Antigen for immunization is processed in 0.1 M acetic acid and formulated with CFA or ICFA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInduction of Arthritis. Immunization protocol: Mice are injected with 100 μg of type II collagen in CFA at predetermined intervals during the study period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mice are examined at predetermined intervals for the development of arthritis. Presumptive evidence of arthritis includes swelling and erythema of at least one toe joint on the front and/or rear feet on two consecutive observations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConfirmatory Diagnosis of Arthritis. Histological Examination of joints: The toe joints of animals sacrificed at appropriate intervals are removed, fixed, decalcified, embedded, in paraffin, sectioned, and stained for observation of general cellular and structural features and to detect cartilaginous matrix of the pannus of each joint, as appropriate. The degree of cellularity and areas of inflammation are quantified by using digitization of histological photomicrographs and applying standard area and point counting techniques as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiographic evaluation of toe joints is performed to detect the incidence of joint changes after immunization with type II collagen. A mammography imaging system has been modified for this work. The average area of soft tissue (pannus) of the joint is determined by analysis of computer digitized radiographs, along with changes in density of the adjacent hard tissues by comparison with internal standards included with each radiograph. To serve as a baseline control for the changing density of the hard tissues and areas of panni, additional mice are used over the same period and the density and area data compared. The significance of the differences in density and area for control and experimental mice is assessed using paired T-tests at each time point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArthritis Evaluation. Animals are observed daily for the onset of arthritis. An arthritis index is derived by grading the severity of involvement of each paw on a scale from 0 to 4. Scoring is based upon the degree of peri-articular erythema and edema, as well as deformity of the joints. Swelling of hind paws is also quantitated by measuring the thickness of the ankle from the medial to the lateral malledus with a constant tension caliper.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTuohy et al. (J. Immunol. (1988) 141: 1126-1130), Sobel et al. (J. Immunol. (1984) 132: 2393-2401), and Traugott (Cell Immunol. (1989) 119: 114-129), describe experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse model for multiple sclerosis. This mouse model can be used to evaluate an hK1 binding protein for modulation of a symptom of multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nAlso featured is a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, that includes an hK1 binding protein, e.g., an hK1 binding antibody, e.g., as described herein. As used herein, “pharmaceutical compositions” encompass compounds (e.g., labeled compounds) for diagnostic (e.g., in vivo imaging) use as well as compounds for therapeutic or prophylactic use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. In one embodiment, the carrier is other than water. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n66:1-19). Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for administration of humans with antibodies. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In a preferred embodiment, the compound is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment, the compound is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. A pharmaceutical composition can also be tested to insure it meets regulatory and industry standards for administration. For example, endotoxin levels in the preparation can be tested using the \nLimulus amebocyte \nlysate assay (e.g., using the kit from Bio Whittaker lot # 7L3790, sensitivity 0.125 EU/mL) according to the USP 24/NF 19 methods. Sterility of pharmaceutical compositions can be determined using thioglycollate medium according to the USP 24/NF 19 methods. For example, the preparation is used to inoculate the thioglycollate medium and incubated at 35° C. for 14 or more days. The medium is inspected periodically to detect growth of a microorganism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary methods for formulating antibodies for delivery by inhalation are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an hK1 binding antibody is formulated for subcutaneous delivery, e.g., subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous delivery can be used to treat any disorder described herein. In one implementation, the antibody is provided as a stable lyophilized protein formulation that includes a lyoprotectant (e.g., a sugar such as sucrose or trehalose). The lyophilized formulation can be reconstituted to generate a stable reconstituted formulation having a protein concentration which is significantly higher (e.g. from about 2-40 times higher, preferably 3-10 times higher and most preferably 3-6 times higher) than the protein concentration in the pre-lyophilized formulation. In particular, while the protein concentration in the pre-lyophilized formulation may be 5 mg/mL or less, the protein concentration in the reconstituted formulation can be 50 mg/mL or more. Accordingly, the formulation can include at least about 50 mg/ml of the hK1 binding protein. Such high protein concentrations in the reconstituted formulation can be useful for subcutaneous administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reconstituted formulation can be isotonic. It can include a preservative (such as bacteriostatic water for injection, BWFI). The reconstituted formulation may be used for a multi-use formulation. Such a formulation is useful, for example, where the patient requires frequent subcutaneous administrations of the protein to treat a chronic medical condition. The ratio of lyoprotectant to protein may, for example, be about 100-1500 mole trehalose or sucrose:1 mole antibody. A buffer can be used to stabilize the pH of the pre-lyophilized preparation, e.g. a pH in the range of 6-8. For example, the buffer can include one or more amino acid, e.g., histidine, or other agent that buffers within the range of 6-8 or has a pKa in such range. The formulation may further include a surfactant (e.g. a polysorbate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. For many applications, the route/mode of administration is intravenous injection or infusion. For example, for therapeutic applications, the compound can be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of less than 30, 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 100 mg/m\n2 \nor 7 to 25 mg/m\n2\n. The route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known. See, e.g., \nSustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems\n, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. Pharmaceutical formulation is a well-established art, and is further described in Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20\nth \ned., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2000) (ISBN: 0683306472); Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7\nth \nEd., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers (1999) (ISBN: 0683305727); and Kibbe (ed.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients American Pharmaceutical Association, 3\nrd \ned. (2000) (ISBN: 091733096X).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the composition may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The compound (and other ingredients, if desired) may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. To administer a compound by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,163, 5,383,851, 5,312,335, 5,064,413, 4,941,880, 4,790,824, or 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present invention include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4.,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Of course, many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the compound can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties that are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V.V. Ranade (1989) J. Clin. Pharmacol. 29:685).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso within the scope of the invention are kits comprising a composition described herein (e.g., a composition a compound that contains an hK1 binding protein and instructions for use, e.g., treatment, prophylactic, or diagnostic use. In one embodiment, the kit includes (a) the compound, e.g., a composition that includes the compound, and, optionally, (b) informational material. The informational material can be descriptive, instructional, marketing or other material that relates to the methods described herein and/or the use of the compound for the methods described herein. For example, the informational material describes methods for administering the compound to reduce hK1 activity or to treat or prevent an hK1-associated disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the informational material can include instructions to administer the compound in a suitable manner, e.g., in a suitable dose, dosage form, or mode of administration (e.g., a dose, dosage form, or mode of administration described herein). In another embodiment, the informational material can include instructions for identifying a suitable subject, e.g., a human, e.g., a human having, or at risk for an hK1-associated disorder or a disorder characterized by excessive hK1 activity. The informational material can include information about production of the compound, molecular weight of the compound, concentration, date of expiration, batch or production site information, and so forth. The informational material of the kits is not limited in its form. In many cases, the informational material, e.g., instructions, is provided in printed matter, e.g., a printed text, drawing, and/or photograph, e.g., a label or printed sheet. However, the informational material can also be provided in other formats, such as Braille, computer readable material, video recording, or audio recording. In another embodiment, the informational material of the kit is a link or contact information, e.g., a physical address, email address, hyperlink, website, or telephone number, where a user of the kit can obtain substantive information about the compound and/or its use in the methods described herein. Of course, the informational material can also be provided in any combination of formats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the compound, the composition of the kit can include other ingredients, such as a solvent or buffer, a stabilizer or a preservative, and/or a second agent for treating a condition or disorder described herein. Alternatively, the other ingredients can be included in the kit, but in different compositions or containers than the compound. In such embodiments, the kit can include instructions for admixing the compound and the other ingredients, or for using the compound together with the other ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, dried or lyophilized form. It is preferred that the compound be substantially pure and/or sterile. When the compound is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. When the compound is provided as a dried form, reconstitution generally is by the addition of a suitable solvent. The solvent, e.g., sterile water or buffer, can optionally be provided in the kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing the compound. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, or syringe, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet. In other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single, undivided container. For example, the composition is contained in a bottle, vial or syringe that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each containing one or more unit dosage forms (e.g., a dosage form described herein) of the compound. For example, the kit includes a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a single unit dose of the compound. The containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or evaporation), and/or light-tight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment wherein the compound contains an hK1 binding antibody, the instructions for diagnostic applications include the use of the compound to detect hK1, in vitro, e.g., in a sample, e.g., a biopsy or cells from a patient having a pulmonary disorder or other disorder described herein, or in vivo. In another embodiment, the instructions for therapeutic applications include suggested dosages and/or modes of administration in a patient with a pulmonary disorder or other disorder described herein, e.g., asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, interstitial cystitis or a neoplastic disorder (e.g., a metastatic disorder or tumor angiogenesis). The kit can further contain a least one additional reagent, such as a diagnostic or therapeutic agent, e.g., a diagnostic or therapeutic agent as described herein, and/or one or more additional agents to treat the disorder, formulated as appropriate, in one or more separate pharmaceutical preparations.\n\n\n \nTreatments\n\n\n \n \n \nAn hK1 binding protein can be administered to a subject, e.g., a human subject, to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose a variety of disorders, such as hK1-associated disorders and diseases characterized by unwanted or aberrant hK1 activity. Exemplary disorders include asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, interstitial cystitis, or other hK1-associated disorder, or a neoplastic disorder (e.g., metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, tumor angiogenesis). An “hK1-associated disorder” is a disorder in which hK1 mediates at least in part, such that reducing hK1 protein levels or activity can ameliorate at least one aspect of the disorder, e.g., at least one symptom of the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to being administered to a subject, the compound can also be administered to cells, tissues, or organs in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treat” or “treatment” is defined as the application or administration of a compound, alone or in combination with one or more other agents, to a subject, e.g., a patient, or application or administration of the agent to an isolated tissue or cell, e.g., cell line, from a subject, e.g., a patient, who has a disorder (e.g., a disorder as described herein), a symptom of a disorder or a predisposition toward a disorder, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disorder, the symptoms of the disorder or the predisposition toward the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an amount of an hK1 binding protein effective to treat a disorder, or a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of the compound which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a subject, e.g., curing, alleviating, relieving or ameliorating at least one symptom of a disorder in a subject to a degree beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. For example, the disorder can be a pulmonary disorder, e.g., a pulmonary disorder described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “locally effective amount” refers to the amount (e.g., concentration) of the compound which is effective at detectably modulating activity of a target protein (e.g., hK1) in a tissue, e.g., in a region of the lung exposed to hK1. Evidence of modulation can include, e.g., increased amount of substrate, e.g., reduced proteolysis of the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an amount of an hK1 binding protein effective to prevent a disorder, or a “a prophylactically effective amount” of the protein refers to an amount of an hK1-binding protein which is effective, upon single- or multiple-dose administration to the subject, in preventing or delaying the occurrence of the onset or recurrence of a disorder, e.g., an hK1 associated disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “induce”, “inhibit”, “potentiate”, “elevate”, “increase”, “decrease” or the like, e.g., which denote quantitative differences between two states, refer to a difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference (e.g., P<0.05, 0.02, or 0.005), between the two states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound described herein is 0.1-20 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. The compound can be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of less than 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 50 mg/m\n2 \nor about 5 to 20 mg/m\n2\n. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are only exemplary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition may include a “therapeutically effective amount” or a “prophylactically effective amount” of a compound described herein, e.g., a compound that includes a polypeptide that binds and inhibits hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition is outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include human and non-human animals. The term “non-human animals” of the invention includes all vertebrates, e.g., non-mammals (such as chickens, amphibians, reptiles) and mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dog, cow, pig, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject method can be used on cells in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo. The method can be performed on cells present in a subject, as part of an in vivo (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic) protocol. For in vivo embodiments, the contacting step is effected in a subject and includes administering the hK1-binding protein to the subject under conditions effective to permit both binding of the protein to hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administering compounds are described in “Pharmaceutical Compositions.” Suitable dosages of the compounds used will depend on the age and weight of the subject and the particular drug used. The compounds can be used as competitive agents to inhibit, reduce an undesirable interaction, e.g., between a natural substrate and hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhK1 binding proteins may also be used to deliver a variety of payloads, for example, drugs including therapeutic drugs, a compound emitting radiation, molecules of plants, fungal, or bacterial origin, biological proteins, and mixtures thereof. An hK1 binding protein can target the payload to a region of a subject in which hK1 is localized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof are exemplified by diphtheria toxin A fragment, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, α-sacrin, certain \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, certain Dianthin proteins, \nPhytolacca americana \nproteins (PAP, PAPII and PAP-S), \nMorodica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, \nSaponaria officinalis \ninhibitor, gelonin, mitogillin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin. Procedures for preparing enzymatically active polypeptides of the immunotoxins are described in WO 84/03508 and WO 85/03508. Examples of cytotoxic moieties that can be conjugated to the antibodies include adriamycin, chlorambucil, daunomycin, methotrexate, neocarzinostatin, and platinum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of polypeptide toxins, recombinant nucleic acid techniques can be used to construct a nucleic acid that encodes the hK1 binding protein and the cytotoxin (or a polypeptide component thereof) as translational fusions. The recombinant nucleic acid is then expressed, e.g., in cells and the encoded fusion polypeptide isolated. The fusion protein can be physically associated with a moiety that increases the molecular weight of the compound, e.g., to stabilize half-life in vivo, and then attached to a moiety (e.g., a polymer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedures for conjugating proteins with the cytotoxic agents have been previously described. For conjugating chlorambucil with proteins, see, e.g., Flechner (1973) \nEuropean Journal of Cancer, \n9:741-745; Ghose et al. (1972) \nBritish Medical Journal, \n3:495-499; and Szekerke, et al. (1972) \nNeoplasma, \n19:211-215. For conjugating daunomycin and adriamycin to proteins, see, e.g., Hurwitz, E. et al. (1975) \nCancer Research, \n35:1175-1181 and Amon et al. (1982) \nCancer Surveys, \n1:429-449. For preparing protein-ricin conjugates, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,414,148 and by Osawa, T., et al. (1982) \nCancer Surveys, \n1:373-388 and the references cited therein. Coupling procedures as also described in EP 226 419.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, hK1 binding antibodies are used without conjugation to another moiety, e.g., as a full length antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The hK1 binding protein can also be used to ameliorate at least one symptom of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema, along with chronic bronchitis, is part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is a serious lung disease and is progressive, usually occurring in elderly patients. COPD causes over-inflation of structures in the lungs known as alveoli or air sacs. The walls of the alveoli break down resulting in a decrease in the respiratory ability of the lungs. Patients with this disease may first experience shortness of breath and cough. One clinical index for evaluating COPD is the destructive index which measures a measure of alveolar septal damage and emphysema, and has been proposed as a sensitive index of lung destruction that closely reflects functional abnormalities, especially loss of elastic recoil. See, e.g., Am Rev Respir Dis 1991 July; 144(1):156-9. The compound can be used to reduce the destructive index in a patient, e.g., a statistically significant amount, e.g., at least 10, 20, 30, or 40% or at least to within 50, 40, 30, or 20% of normal of a corresponding age and gender-matched individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition can be formulated for inhalation or other mode of pulmonary delivery. Accordingly, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation to pulmonary tissue. The term “pulmonary tissue” as used herein refers to any tissue of the respiratory tract and includes both the upper and lower respiratory tract, except where otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, hK1 binding proteins can be administered in a method of treating (e.g., reducing, ameliorating) or preventing one or more symptoms associated with a respiratory disorder, e.g., asthma (e.g., allergic and nonallergic asthma); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); a condition involving airway inflammation, eosinophilia, fibrosis and excess mucus production, e.g., cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAsthma. Symptoms of asthma include, for example, wheezing, shortness of breath, bronchoconstriction, airway hyperreactivity, decreased lung capacity, fibrosis, airway inflammation, and mucus production). An hK1 binding protein can be used to ameliorate or prevent at least one symptom of asthma, e.g., one of the above. An hK1 binding protein can also be administered in conjunction with another agent for treating asthma, e.g., anti-IgE antibody, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil, an inhaled steroids, a leukotriene modifier, a long-acting beta-agonists, an oral steroid, and theophylline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This disorder is characterized by inflammation in the lining of the joints and/or other internal organs. It is typically chronic, but can include flare-ups. Exemplary symptoms include inflammation of joints, swelling, difficulty moving, pain, loss of appetite, fever, loss of energy, anemia, lumps (rheumatoid nodules) under the skin, especially in areas subject to pressure (e.g., back of elbows). An hK1 binding protein can be used to ameliorate or prevent at least one symptom of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn hK1 binding protein can be administered in conjunction with another agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis, such as NSAIDs and aspirin, analgesics, and corticosteroids, help reduce joint pain, stiffness and swelling. Exemplary agents include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, leflunomide, D-Penicillamine, sulfasalazine, gold therapy, minocycline, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine (and other antimalarials), cyclosporine, Prosorba therapy, and biologic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple Sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disease that is characterized by inflammation and loss of myelin sheaths. Patients that have MS or clinically probable MS may be identified by criteria establishing a diagnosis of clinically definite MS as defined by the workshop on the diagnosis of MS (Poser et al., Ann. Neurol. 13:227, 1983). Briefly, an individual with clinically definite MS has had two attacks and clinical evidence of either two lesions or clinical evidence of one lesion and paraclinical evidence of another, separate lesion. Definite MS may also be diagnosed by evidence of two attacks and oligoclonal bands of IgG in cerebrospinal fluid or by combination of an attack, clinical evidence of two lesions and oligoclonal band of IgG in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients having MS or clinically probably MS can be administered an hK1 binding protein, e.g., an hK1 binding antibody, to ameliorate at least one symptom of MS. The hK1 binding protein can also be provided in conjunction with another agent, e.g., IFNβ-1a and IFNβ-1b; a protein that simulates myelin basic protein (e.g., a synthetic protein, e.g., glatiramer acetate, COPAXONE®); corticosteroids; or mitoxantrone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective treatment of multiple sclerosis may be examined in several different ways. Satisfying any of the following criteria evidences effective treatment. Three main criteria are used: EDSS (extended disability status scale), appearance of exacerbations or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). The EDSS is a means to grade clinical impairment due to MS (Kurtzke, Neurology 33:1444, 1983). Eight functional systems are evaluated for the type and severity of neurologic impairment. Briefly, prior to treatment, patients are evaluated for impairment in the following systems: pyramidal, cerebella, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other. Follow-ups are conducted at defined intervals. The scale ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). A decrease of one full step defines an effective treatment in the context of the present invention (Kurtzke, Ann. Neurol. 36:573-79, 1994). Exacerbations are defined as the appearance of a new symptom that is attributable to MS and accompanied by an appropriate new neurologic abnormality (IFNB MS Study Group, supra). In addition, the exacerbation must last at least 24 hours and be preceded by stability or improvement for at least 30 days. Briefly, patients are given a standard neurological examination by clinicians. Exacerbations are either mild, moderate, or severe according to changes in a Neurological Rating Scale (Sipe et al., Neurology 34:1368, 1984). An annual exacerbation rate and proportion of exacerbation-free patients are determined. Therapy is deemed to be effective if there is a statistically significant difference in the rate or proportion of exacerbation-free patients between the treated group and the placebo group for either of these measurements. In addition, time to first exacerbation and exacerbation duration and severity may also be measured. A measure of effectiveness as therapy in this regard is a statistically significant difference in the time to first exacerbation or duration and severity in the treated group compared to control group. MRI can be used to measure active lesions using gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced imaging (McDonald et al. Ann. Neurol. 36:14, 1994) or the location and extent of lesions using T\n2\n-weighted techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis include: optic neuritis, diplopia, nystagmus, ocular dysmetria, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, movement and sound phosphenes, afferent pupillary defect, paresis, monoparesis, paraparesis, hemiparesis, quadraparesis, plegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, tetraplegia, quadraplegia, spasticity, dysarthria, muscle atrophy, spasms, cramps, hypotonia, clonus, myoclonus, myokymia, restless leg syndrome, footdrop, dysfunctional reflexes, paraesthesia, anaesthesia, neuralgia, neuropathic and neurogenic pain, l'hermitte's, proprioceptive dysfunction, trigeminal neuralgia, ataxia, intention tremor, dysmetria, vestibular ataxia, vertigo, speech ataxia, dystonia, dysdiadochokinesia, frequent micturation, bladder spasticity, flaccid bladder, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmy, frigidity, constipation, fecal urgency, fecal incontinence, depression, cognitive dysfunction, dementia, mood swings, emotional lability, euphoria, bipolar syndrome, anxiety, aphasia, dysphasia, fatigue, uhthoff's symptom, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleeping disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease. It is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joint, thus causing bones to rub against each other, causing pain and loss of movement. An hK1 binding protein can be used to ameliorate or prevent at least one symptom of osteoarthritis. An hK1 binding protein can be administered in conjunction with another agent for treating osteoarthritis, such as a corticosteroid or a NSAID.\n\n\n \nAngiogenesis-Associated and Neoplastic Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, hK1 binding proteins can be administered to a subject to modulate angiogenesis or other processes associated with neoplasia and tumor growth. hK1 binding proteins, particularly ones that inhibit hK1 enzymatic activity, may be used to block tumor angiogenesis and/or cancer cell invasion and metastasis. hK1 inhibitor antibodies are potent and selective inhibitors, and thus are ideal agents for tumor therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an hK1 binding protein can be used to reduce angiogenesis (e.g., uncontrolled or unwanted angiogenesis)—such as angiogenesis associated with vascular malformations and cardiovascular disorders (e.g., atherosclerosis, restenosis and arteriovenous malformations), chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis), aberrant wound repairs (e.g., those that are observed following excimer laser eye surgery), circulatory disorders (e.g., Raynaud's phenomenon), crest syndromes (e.g., calcinosis, esophageal and dyomotiloty), dermatological disorders (e.g., Port-wine stains, arterial ulcers, systemic vasculitis and scleroderma), or ocular disorders (e.g., blindness caused by neovascular disease, neovascular glaucoma, corneal neovascularization, trachoma, diabetic retinopathy and myopic degeneration). See, e.g., Carmeliet and Jain, 2000\n, Nature, \n407: 249-257.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, an HK1 binding protein can be used to reduce angiogenesis associated with neoplasia, e.g., cancer and tumor growth, e.g., growth of a benign, malignant, or metastatic tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of cancerous disorders include, but are not limited to, solid tumors, soft tissue tumors, and metastatic lesions. Examples include sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and carcinomas, of the various organ systems, such as those affecting lung, breast, lymphoid, gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), and genitourinary tract (e.g., renal, urothelial cells), pharynx, prostate, ovary as well as adenocarcinomas which include malignancies such as most colon cancers, rectal cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, liver cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, pharynx, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the esophagus and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary solid tumors that can be treated include: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hk1 binding protein can also be used to treat a carcinoma, e.g., a malignancy of epithelial or endocrine tissues including respiratory system carcinomas, gastrointestinal system carcinomas, genitourinary system carcinomas, testicular carcinomas, breast carcinomas, prostatic carcinomas, endocrine system carcinomas, and melanomas. Exemplary carcinomas include adenocarcinoma, carcinomas of tissue of the cervix, lung, prostate, breast, head and neck, colon and ovary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hk1 binding protein can also be used to treat sarcomas, e.g., malignant tumors of mesenchymal derivation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method can also be used to inhibit the proliferation of hyperplastic/neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin, e.g., arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof. For instance, the method can be used to treat various myeloid disorders including acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus, L., 1991\n, Crit. Rev. in Oncol./Hemotol. \n11:267-297). Lymphoid malignancies which may be treated by the subject method include, but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which includes B-lineage ALL and T-lineage ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), hairy cell leukemia (HLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Additional forms of malignant lymphomas include, but are not limited to, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and variants thereof, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGF) and Hodgkin's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn hK1 binding protein can be administered in combination with another agent for treating a neoplastic and/or metastatic disorder. Examples of such other agents include:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) other antiangiogenic agents (for example, linomide, inhibitors of integrin α\nv\nβ\n3 \nfunction, angiostatin, razoxane);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) cytostatic agents such as antiestrogens (for example tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxifene), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example anastrozole, letrozole, borazole, exemestane), antihormones, antiprogestogens, antiandrogens (for example flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), LHRH agonists and antagonists (for example gosereline acetate, leuprolide), inhibitors of testosterone 5.alpha.-dihydroreductase (for example finasteride), farnesyltransferase inhibitors, anti-invasion agents (for example metalloproteinase inhibitors like marimastat and inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor function) and inhibitors of growth factor function, (such growth factors include for example EGF, FGF, platelet derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor such inhibitors include growth factor antibodies, growth factor receptor antibodies such as AVASTIN® (bevacizumab) and ERBITUX® (cetuximab); tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors); and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof; as used in medical oncology, such as antimetabolites (for example antifolates like methotrexate, fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil, purine and adenosine analogues, cytosine arabinoside); Intercalating antitumour antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin, mithramycin); platinum derivatives (for example cisplatin, carboplatin); alkylating agents (for example nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide nitrosoureas, thiotepa; antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincristine and taxoids like TAXOL® (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and newer microbtubule agents such as epothilone analogs, discodermolide analogs, and eleutherobin analogs); topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide, amsacrine, topotecan); cell cycle inhibitors (for example flavopyridols); biological response modifiers and proteasome inhibitors such as VELCADE® (bortezomib).\n\n\n \nExemplary Modulators of VEGF Class Growth Factors\n\n\n \n \n \nA variety of agents can be used to modulate activity of VEGF class growth factors, e.g., to modulate VEGF activity (for example, by modulating activity the protein itself; its receptor, or other signalling components). Such agents can be administered in combination with a hK1 binding protein to modulate angiogenesis and treat a neoplastic and/or metastatic disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents can be small molecule inhibitors (e.g., compounds that do not include a peptide bond and/or compounds that are smaller than 700 Daltons molecular weight). Other agents include compounds, e.g., small molecule compounds or proteins, that bind to VEGF, VEGF-C, or receptors thereof. Still other agents modulate expression or activity of VEGF, VEGF-C, or receptors thereof.\n\n\n \nExemplary Agents Include the Following:\n\n\n \n \n \nBevacizumab (AVASTIN®) is an antibody that binds to VEGF. Bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of certain cancers. US 2004-0133357 describes additional antibodies that can inhibit VEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUS2003-0120038 describes soluble VEGF-receptor fragments that can have inhibitory activity. 2004-0054143 describes a small peptide fragment of VEGF which has inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of small molecule inhibitors of VEGF activity are known. 2004-0147449 describes VEGF-R inhibitors, including a class of compounds exemplified by 4-Chlorophenyl)[4-(4-pyridylmethyl)-phthalazin-1-yl]ammonium hydrogen succinate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSU5416 (semaxanib) is a small molecule inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. See, e.g., Heymach et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Sep. 1; 10(17):5732-40. SU11248 is another exemplary inhibitor. See, e.g., Mendel (2003) Clin Cancer Res. 9(1):327-37.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4-[4-(1-Amino-1-methylethyl)phenyl]-2-[4-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl)phenylamino]pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile (JNJ-17029259) and related compounds in the structural class of 5-cyanopyrimidines are orally available, selective, nanomolar inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2) and other tyrosine kinases involved in angiogenesis, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R3. At nanomolar levels, JNJ-17029259 can inhibit proliferation/migration, the formation of vascular sprouting in the rat aortic ring model of angiogenesis, and the development of new veins and arteries in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. See, e.g., Emanuel et al. (2004) Mol. Pharmacol. 2004 September; 66(3):635-47.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another small molecule inhibitor is ZD6474, which inhibits VEGF-R2 tyrosine kinase activity, but with additional inhibitory effects on other growth factors. See, e.g., Sandstrom et al. British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 10 Aug. 2004; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6602108 www.bjcancer.com\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTK787/ZK 222584 is another small molecule inhibitor VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. (see, e.g., Thomas et al. (2003) Semin Oncol. 2003 Jun.; 30(3 Suppl 6):32-8.). Mohammadi et al. (1998) EMBO Journal Vol. 17, pp. 5896-5904, 1998 describe a molecule of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine class, designated PD 173074, that selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activities of the FGF and VEGF receptors. Administration of PD 173074 in mice can effectively block angiogenesis with no apparent toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUS 2002-0165174 describes oligonucleotides that inhibit VEGF. Antisense oligonucleotide can be used to lower VEGF and VEGF-C levels. Such oligonucleotides can reduce cancer cell growth, e.g., mesothelioma cell growth. Antibodies to VEGF receptors (VEGFR-2) and VEGF-C (VEGFR-3) have also been observed to slowed cancer cell growth. US 2004-0138163 describes siRNAs that can inhibit VEGF. Inhibitors nucleic acids such as anti-sense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, and ribozymes can be used to modulate expression of VEGF, VEGF-C, or receptors thereof. See, e.g., Int J Cancer 2003 May 1; 104(5): 603-10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods include killing or inhibiting cells that produce VEGF. A diphtheria toxin-VEGF fusion protein (DT-VEGF), which is highly toxic to cells that express VEGF, was inhibit proliferation mesothelioma cells. See, e.g., Blood 2001 Sep. 15; 98(6): 1904-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of VEGF class molecules are also reviewed, e.g., in Verheul et al. (2003) Drugs Today (Barc). 2003;39 Suppl C:81-93.\n\n\n \nInhalation\n\n\n \n \n \nA composition that includes an hK1 binding antibody can be formulated for inhalation or other mode of pulmonary delivery. Accordingly, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation to pulmonary tissue. The term “pulmonary tissue” as used herein refers to any tissue of the respiratory tract and includes both the upper and lower respiratory tract, except where otherwise indicated. An hK1 binding antibody can be administered in combination with one or more of the existing modalities for treating pulmonary diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the compound is formulated for a nebulizer. In one embodiment, the compound can be stored in a lyophilized form (e.g., at room temperature) and reconstituted in solution prior to inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to formulate the compound for inhalation using a medical device, e.g., an inhaler. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,035 (a powder inhaler) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,012,454 (a dry powder inhaler). The inhaler can include separate compartments for the active compound at a pH suitable for storage and another compartment for a neutralizing buffer and a mechanism for combining the compound with a neutralizing buffer immediately prior to atomization. In one embodiment, the inhaler is a metered dose inhaler.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe three common systems used to deliver drugs locally to the pulmonary air passages include dry powder inhalers (DPIs), metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and nebulizers. MDIs, the most popular method of inhalation administration, may be used to deliver medicaments in a solubilized form or as a dispersion. Typically MDIs comprise a Freon or other relatively high vapor pressure propellant that forces aerosolized medication into the respiratory tract upon activation of the device. Unlike MDIs, DPIs generally rely entirely on the inspiratory efforts of the patient to introduce a medicament in a dry powder form to the lungs. Nebulizers form a medicament aerosol to be inhaled by imparting energy to a liquid solution. Direct pulmonary delivery of drugs during liquid ventilation or pulmonary lavage using a fluorochemical medium has also been explored. These and other methods can be used to deliver an hK1 binding antibody. In one embodiment, the hK1 binding antibody is associated with a polymer, e.g., a polymer that stabilizes or increases half-life of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, for administration by inhalation, an hK1 binding antibody is delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant or a nebulizer. The compound may be in the form of a dry particle or as a liquid. Particles that include the compound can be prepared, e.g., by spray drying, by drying an aqueous solution of the hK1 binding antibody with a charge neutralizing agent and then creating particles from the dried powder or by drying an aqueous solution in an organic modifier and then creating particles from the dried powder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of an hK1 binding antibody and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch, if the particle is a formulated particle. In addition to the formulated or unformulated compound, other materials such as 100% DPPC or other surfactants can be mixed with the hK1 binding antibody to promote the delivery and dispersion of formulated or unformulated compound. Methods of preparing dry particles are described, for example, in PCT Publication WO 02/32406.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn hK1 binding antibody can be formulated for aerosol delivery, e.g., as dry aerosol particles, such that when administered it can be rapidly absorbed and can produce a rapid local or systemic therapeutic result. Administration can be tailored to provide detectable activity within 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 3 hours of administration. In some embodiments, the peak activity can be achieved even more quickly, e.g., within one half hour or even within ten minutes. An hK1 binding antibody can be formulated for longer biological half-life (e.g., by association with a polymer such as PEG) can be used as an alternative to other modes of administration, e.g., such that the compound enters circulation from the lung and is distributed to other organs or to a particular target organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the hK1 binding antibody is delivered in an amount such that at least 5% of the mass of the polypeptide is delivered to the lower respiratory tract or the deep lung. Deep lung has an extremely rich capillary network. The respiratory membrane separating capillary lumen from the alveolar air space is very thin (≦6 μm) and extremely permeable. In addition, the liquid layer lining the alveolar surface is rich in lung surfactants. In other embodiments, at least 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the composition of an hK1 binding antibody is delivered to the lower respiratory tract or to the deep lung. Delivery to either or both of these tissues results in efficient absorption of the compound and high bioavailability. In one embodiment, the compound is provided in a metered dose using, e.g., an inhaler or nebulizer. For example, the compound is delivered in a dosage unit form of at least about 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 50 mg/puff or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent bioavailability can be calculated as follows: the percent bioavailability=(AUC\nnon-invasive\n/AUC\ni.v or s.c\n)×(dose\ni.v or s.c\n/dose\nnon-invasive\n)×100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough not necessary, delivery enhancers such as surfactants can be used to further enhance pulmonary delivery. A “surfactant” as used herein refers to a compound having a hydrophilic and lipophilic moiety, which promotes absorption of a drug by interacting with an interface between two immiscible phases. Surfactants are useful in the dry particles for several reasons, e.g., reduction of particle agglomeration, reduction of macrophage phagocytosis, etc. When coupled with lung surfactant, a more efficient absorption of the compound can be achieved because surfactants, such as DPPC, will greatly facilitate diffusion of the compound. Surfactants are well known in the art and include but are not limited to phosphoglycerides, e.g., phosphatidylcholines, L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl (DPPC) and diphosphatidyl glycerol (DPPG); hexadecanol; fatty acids; polyethylene glycol (PEG); polyoxyethylene-9-; auryl ether; palmitic acid; oleic acid; sorbitan trioleate (Span 85); glycocholate; surfactin; poloxomer; sorbitan fatty acid ester; sorbitan trioleate; tyloxapol; and phospholipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the surfactants for use in the compositions, including the concentrates and diluted compositions, provided herein are high-HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) surfactants. Such high-HLB surfactants generally have an HLB greater than about 10. The HLB is a measure on an arbitrary scale of the polarity of a surfactant or mixture of surfactants. In one embodiment, the compositions provided herein contain from about 3% to about 85% by weight of a high-HLB surfactant In one embodiment, the high-HLB surfactant is an ethoxylated derivative of vitamin E such as tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS). TPGS has an HLB between about 15 and 19. See, e.g., US 2004-0023935\n\n\n \nStabilization and Retention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an hK1 binding antibody is physically associated with a moiety that improves its stabilization and/or retention in circulation, e.g., in blood, serum, lymph, bronchoalveolar lavage, or other tissues, e.g., by at least 1.5, 2, 5, 10, or 50 fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an hK1 binding antibody can be associated with a polymer, e.g., a substantially non-antigenic polymers, such as polyalkylene oxides or polyethylene oxides. Suitable polymers will vary substantially by weight. Polymers having molecular number average weights ranging from about 200 to about 35,000 (or about 1,000 to about 15,000, and 2,000 to about 12,500) can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an hK1 binding antibody can be conjugated to a water soluble polymer, e.g., hydrophilic polyvinyl polymers, e.g. polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone. A non-limiting list of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained. Additional useful polymers include polyoxyalkylenes such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene (Pluronics); polymethacrylates; carbomers; branched or unbranched polysaccharides which comprise the saccharide monomers D-mannose, D- and L-galactose, fucose, fructose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-glucuronic acid, sialic acid, D-galacturonic acid, D-mannuronic acid (e.g. polymannuronic acid, or alginic acid), D-glucosamine, D-galactosamine, D-glucose and neuraminic acid including homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides such as lactose, amylopectin, starch, hydroxyethyl starch, amylose, dextrane sulfate, dextran, dextrins, glycogen, or the polysaccharide subunit of acid mucopolysaccharides, e.g. hyaluronic acid; polymers of sugar alcohols such as polysorbitol and polymannitol; heparin or heparon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther compounds can also be attached to the same polymer, e.g., a cytotoxin, a label, or another targeting agent, e.g., another hK1 binding antibody or an unrelated ligand. Mono-activated, alkoxy-terminated polyalkylene oxides (PAO's), e.g., monomethoxy-terminated polyethylene glycols (mPEG's); C\n1-4 \nalkyl-terminated polymers; and bis-activated polyethylene oxides (glycols) can be used for crosslinking. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,974\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the polymer prior to cross-linking to the ligand need not be, but preferably is, water soluble. Generally, after crosslinking, the product is water soluble, e.g., exhibits a water solubility of at least about 0.01 mg/ml, and more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/ml, and still more preferably at least about 1 mg/ml. In addition, the polymer should not be highly immunogenic in the conjugate form, nor should it possess viscosity that is incompatible with intravenous infusion, aerosolization, or injection if the conjugate is intended to be administered by such routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the polymer contains only a single group which is reactive. This helps to avoid cross-linking of ligand molecules to one another. However, it is within the scope herein to maximize reaction conditions to reduce cross-linking between ligand molecules, or to purify the reaction products through gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography to recover substantially homogenous derivatives. In other embodiments, the polymer contains two or more reactive groups for the purpose of linking multiple ligands to the polymer backbone. Again, gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography can be used to recover the desired derivative in substantially homogeneous form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe molecular weight of the polymer can range up to about 500,000 D, and preferably is at least about 20,000 D, or at least about 30,000 D, or at least about 40,000 D. The molecular weight chosen can depend upon the effective size of the conjugate to be achieved, the nature (e.g. structure, such as linear or branched) of the polymer, and the degree of derivatization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA covalent bond can be used to attach an hK1 binding antibody to a polymer, for example, crosslinking to the N-terminal amino group of the ligand and epsilon amino groups found on lysine residues of the ligand, as well as other amino, imino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl or other hydrophilic groups. The polymer may be covalently bonded directly to the hK1 binding antibody without the use of a multifunctional (ordinarily bifunctional) crosslinking agent. Covalent binding to amino groups is accomplished by known chemistries based upon cyanuric chloride, carbonyl diimidazole, aldehyde reactive groups (PEG alkoxide plus diethyl acetyl of bromoacetaldehyde; PEG plus DMSO and acetic anhydride, or PEG chloride plus the phenoxide of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, activated succinimidyl esters, activated dithiocarbonate PEG, 2,4,5-trichlorophenylcloroformate or P-nitrophenylcloroformate activated PEG.) Carboxyl groups can be derivatized by coupling PEG-amine using carbodiimide. Sulfhydryl groups can be derivatized by coupling to maleimido-substituted PEG (e.g. alkoxy-PEG amine plus sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) WO 97/10847 or PEG-maleimide commercially available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc., Huntsville, Ala.). Alternatively, free amino groups on the ligand (e.g. epsilon amino groups on lysine residues) can be thiolated with 2-imino-thiolane (Traut's reagent) and then coupled to maleimide-containing derivatives of PEG, e.g., as described in Pedley et al., Br. J. Cancer, 70: 1126-1130 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctionalized PEG polymers that can be attached to an hK1 binding antibody are available, e.g., from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. (Huntsville, Ala.). Such commercially available PEG derivatives include, e.g., amino-PEG, PEG amino acid esters, PEG-hydrazide, PEG-thiol, PEG-succinate, carboxymethylated PEG, PEG-propionic acid, PEG amino acids, PEG succinimidyl succinate, PEG succinimidyl propionate, succinimidyl ester of carboxymethylated PEG, succinimidyl carbonate of PEG, succinimidyl esters of amino acid PEGs, PEG-oxycarbonylimidazole, PEG-nitrophenyl carbonate, PEG tresylate, PEG-glycidyl ether, PEG-aldehyde, PEG vinylsulfone, PEG-maleimide, PEG-orthopyridyl-disulfide, heterofunctional PEGs, PEG vinyl derivatives, PEG silanes, and PEG phospholides. The reaction conditions for coupling these PEG derivatives may vary depending on the hK1 binding antibody, the desired degree of PEGylation, and the PEG derivative utilized. Some factors involved in the choice of PEG derivatives include: the desired point of attachment (such as lysine or cysteine R-groups), hydrolytic stability and reactivity of the derivatives, stability, toxicity and antigenicity of the linkage, suitability for analysis, etc. Specific instructions for the use of any particular derivative are available from the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates of an hK1 binding antibody and a polymer can be separated from the unreacted starting materials, e.g., by gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography, e.g., HPLC. Heterologous species of the conjugates are purified from one another in the same fashion. Resolution of different species (e.g. containing one or two PEG residues) is also possible due to the difference in the ionic properties of the unreacted amino acids. See, e.g., WO 96/34015.\n\n\n \nExample\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following is one exemplary strategy for identifying hK1 binding proteins, particularly hK1 inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) KLK1 cDNA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKLK1 cDNA was subcloned into expression vectors for expression in mammalian cells, \nE. coli\n, and \nP. pastoris\n. The sequence of the subcloned material was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2) Protein Expression in \nP. pastoris \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nP. pastoris \nwere transformed with the above subcloned cDNA and clones were selected for expression of hK1 as assessed by protein gel electrophoresis and enzyme activity measurements. Optimized expression conditions were determined and protein was induced in a large \nP. pastoris \nculture volume (2 L).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3) Protein Purification\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhK1 was purified according to Chan et al (1998) \nProtein Expr Purif, \n12(3): p. 361-70.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4) Phage Display Selection and Screening\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinders to recombinant hK1 have been selected from Fab phage display libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo strategies were employed to favor the selection of antibodies that bind at the active site of the hK1 enzyme (Figure). Active site binders compete with enzyme substrate for binding to hK1 and can inhibit hK1 proteolytic activity. Both phage display selection strategies employed the use of hK1 immobilized on beads. Beads were prepared by mixing 5 μg of biotinylated hK1 with 5 mg streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads (Dynal) in a total volume of 500 μL with phosphate buffer saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubating the mixture over night at 4° C. The mixture was then washed 5 times with PBST, 1 μM free biotin was added, then washed again 5 times with PBST, and finally blocked for 1 hour with 2% nonfat dry milk in PBST. The immobilization procedure resulted in complete capture of the biotinylated hK1 and yielded immobilized hK1 that was enzymatically active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first selection strategy, phage (titer=1×10\n13 \npfu) were incubated for 5 minutes with 0.25 mL of immobilized hK1 beads in PBST and a total volume of 1 mL. Phage that bound immobilized hK1 were extracted using a magnetic device and nonspecific phage were eluted by 12 wash cycles with PBST on an automated plate washer (Selection 1). Phage were then eluted from the extracted beads by incubation of 25 μM aprotinin, an active site inhibitor of hK1, for 2 hours, in order to obtain phage eluted from the active site of hK1. The phage eluted by aprotinin and the phage that remained on the beads were amplified according to standard procedures and were each adjusted to a titer of 1×10\n11 \npfu and then separately used as input phage for the next and final round of selection of this strategy (Round II).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Round II, the two phage populations (aka two “sets”, one eluted with aprotinin, the other remaining bound after aprotinin elution) were separately added to 0.05 mL of immobilized hK1 beads, brought to a total volume of 1 mL with PBST and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes before 12 wash cycles were performed. The two “sets” from Round II were then subjected to elution with 25 μM A aprotinin for 2 hours to yield a total of 4 phage populations (aka “pools”) for screening by ELISA for binding to hK1 where \nPool\n 1 was derived from the aprotinin elution of Round I and the aprotinin elution of Round II, Pool 2 was derived from the aprotinin elution of Round I and the phage that remained on the beads in Round II, Pool 3 was derived from the phage that remained on the beads in \nround\n 1 and those that were eluted by aprotinin in Round II, and Pool 4 was derived from the phage that remained on the beads in \nround\n 1 and those that remained on the beads in Round II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA different strategy was invoked in Selection 2 in which phage (titer=1×10\n13 \npfu) were first depleted of non-active site hK1 binders by incubating the phage three times for 1 hour with an immobilized hK1-aprotinin complex prepared by adding 25 μM aprotinin to 0.25 mL immobilized hK1 beads and brought to a total volume of 1 mL with PBST. The depleted phage were then added to 0.25 mL immobilized hK1 beads in 1 mL for 5 minutes and 12 wash cycles with PBST were performed. The phage that remained on the beads were then amplified, adjusted to a titer of 1×10\n11 \npfu and used as input for Round 2. Round 2 and 3 were performed as described for \nround\n 1 where each round had an initial depletion step against the hK1-aprotinin complex before selection against 0.25 mL immobilized hK1 beads. This selection strategy produced one phage population (Pool 5) that was screened by ELISA for binders to hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage from the above five pools were assayed for their ability to bind hK1 by a soluble Fab ELISA. Prior to conducting this ELISA it was necessary to modify the phagemid DNA to permit the Fabs to be expressed without a gene III fusion. This DNA modification was done by first preparing phagemid DNA of each the five pools in \nE. coli \nTG1 cells, then performing a double DNA digest using the MluI restriction enzyme will release the DNA coding for the geneIII stump fragment. After gel purification, the vector was re-ligated (pMID21 vector without gene III stump) and electroporated into \nE. coli \nTG1 cells. Transformants were plated and colonies were picked and grown in 100 μL 2xYT in 96-well plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 0.1% glucose for about 3 hours at 30° C. Fabs were expressed upon addition of 1 mM Isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG) for 16 hours at 30° C. Plates were then spun at 600 g for 10 min and 50 μL supernatant was used for the ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe soluble Fab ELISA was performed by first coating wells of a 96-well plate with 2 μg/mL streptavidin in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4° C. Following washing with PBST and blocking with 1% \nbovine serum albumin\n 10 ng of biotinylated hK1 was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Free hK1 was then removed by 5 washes with PBST. Supernatant (50 μL) from the above described Fab expression is added to the hK1 immobilized on the plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Unbound Fab is then removed by 7 washes with PBST and 100 μl, of horse radish peroxidase conjugated anti-Fab antibody is added to the wells. Free secondary antibody is removed by seven washes with PBST and 100 μL of a colorimetric peroxidase substrate (3, 3′, 5, 5′-Tetramethylbenzidine/hydrogen peroxide) is added to permit the detection of bound Fab by an increase in absorbance at 630 nm. Using this ELISA 960 expressed Fabs were analyzed for each of the 5 selection pools for a total of 4800 Fabs analyzed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5) DNA Sequencing\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1152 ELISA positive soluble Fabs were DNA sequenced from which 335 Fabs had distinct heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6) Determination of Fab Binding Affinity and Enzyme Inhibition Potency\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of 335 Fabs was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding constants in the range of 0.4 to greater than 100 nM were obtained (Table 1). The inhibition of enzyme activity was first screened for all 335 Fabs at a single Fab concentration of 120 nM, followed by the determination of IC50 values for a select number of Fabs (Table 1). Whether or not the Fabs for which no IC50 has been determined may or may not be enzyme inhibitors. The inhibitors may be further evaluated to determine their ability to inhibit bronchial tissue kallikrein activity present in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, twenty four of the highest affinity Fabs found to inhibit hK1 were examined in further detail. An asterisk is used to indicate these Fabs in Table 1. These Fabs were initially identified using a combination of high-throughput SPR and enzyme inhibition screening using small quantities of Fabs purified using a novel high throughput method. Purification of larger quantities of these 24 Fabs using standard antibody purification methods permits a more accurate and detailed examination of their biochemical properties. Steady state enzyme inhibition assays were performed in black, 96 well, round bottomed microplates in a total volume of 100 μL of Reaction Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PEG, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5 nM hK1, a varied concentration of Fab and 100 μM Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate. Before the addition of substrate to initiate the reaction, the hK1 and Fab were incubate in the well of the assay plate for 1 hour at 30° C. The substrate was then added and the reaction was monitored using a fluorescence plate reader (Gemini XS, Molecular Devices) using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were plotted against inhibitor concentration and fit to the standard hyperbolic equation for enzyme inhibition by nonlinear regression to provide IC\n50 \nestimates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific exemplary antibodies are designated in the form of M0103-A01. All the names begin “M0”, hence the names are sometimes shortened by removal of the lead “M0”. The antibody name “103-A01” refers to the same antibody as does “M0103-A01”. The HC of M0103-A01 is named HC-103-A01 and the LC is named LC-103-A01.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n7) Mouse Model of Airway Inflammation Studies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab's can be evaluated for ability to modulate airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma, e.g., as described in Kips et al., (2003) “Murine models of asthma” Eur. Respir. J. 22, 374-382. Fabs may also be reformatted as IgG molecules and evaluated using one or more assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding

This antibody was found to inhibit both mK1 and hK1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the exemplary antibodies described herein have sequence inter-relationships. Two antibodies that share LC, HC CDR3, or HC CDR1 and HC CDR2 are likely to bind to approximately the same site on hK1. A common HC CDR3 is especially indicative of a shared binding site. Thus, the inhibitory properties of two antibodies that share the named areas of sequence are likely to be similar. In particular, if one antibody is an inhibitor of hK1, then any antibody that shares the sequence of the first antibody is likely to also be an inhibitor.

SDS-PAGE showed that all nine antibodies examined inhibited kininogenase activity of hK1 towards high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). Intact HMWK migrates as a 100 kDa protein that is digested by hK1 to give a fragment that runs at approximately 60 kDa (\nlanes\n 1 and 2). All 9 of the hK1 inhibitors (lanes 4 through 12) that were tested prevented HMWK digestion. Experiments were performed by incubating 10 nM hK1 with 1 μM Ab for 3 hours at 37° C. prior to the addition of 0.1 mg/mL HMWK. HMWK was reacted with hK1 for 3 hours at 37° C. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels (10% acrylamide) were loaded with 1 μg HMWK and run according to standard procedures. \nLane\n 1 contains undigested HMWK, lane 2 contains digested HMWK, lane 3 contains molecular weight markers from Invitrogen, lane 4 contains HMWK+hK1+DX-2300, \nlane\n 5 contains HMWK+hK1+M0106-G12, lane 6 contains HMWK+hK1+M0111-C12, lane 7 contains HMWK+hK1+M0098-G05, \nlane\n 8 contains HMWK+hK1+M0137-E01, \nlane\n 9 contains HMWK+hK1+M0112-D03, \nlane\n 10 contains HMWK+hK1+M0102-H11, lane 11 contains HMWK+hK1+M0114-G06, lane 12 contains HMWK+hK1+M0098-E09.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTowards LMWK it is evident that all 9 Fabs inhibited the extent of digestion. However, only DX-2300 (lane 4) and M0137-E01 (lane 8) appeared to completely inhibit LMWK digestion. The reactions were performed as described above for HMWK and the lanes contain the same contents as above except that LMWK is substituted for HMWK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpitope Grouping of Selected hK1 Binding Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelected antibodies were grouped according to whether or not that recognize the same epitope on hK1 as DX-2300 using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach (\nFIG. 1\n, Table 5). This type of information can lead to the discovery of matched pairs of antibodies for quantitative measurements hK1 in biological samples. This information is also valuable to compare antibodies to the lead inhibitor (DX-2300) and choose back up inhibitors that either share the same epitope or different epitopes as DX-2300. FIG. \n1\n shows two representative sensorgrams for a Fab (M0112-D07) that shares the same epitope as DX-2300 (panel A) and a Fab that binds a different epitope (panel B). The ratio of the SPR signal for the Fab following the injection of DX-2300 (R1) divided by the signal of the Fab alone (R2) provides an indication of which Fabs share the same epitope as DX-2300. Since the second inject of DX-2300 produces a R2/R1 ratio of 0.1, Fabs with R2/R1 ratios significantly greater than 0.1 indicate binding at a different epitope than DX-2300. Out of the 12 Fabs that were examined, only M0111-C12, M0137-E01 and M0139-A09 did not share the same epitope as DX-2300 (Table 5). The epitope of certain Fabs (M0109-F02 and M0098-E09) may partially overlap that of DX-2300, since an intermediate signal response was observed (Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope Grouping By Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFab Signal\n\n\n \n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFab Signal following\n\n\nAlone\n\n\nRatio\n\n\nDX-2300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab\n\n\nDX-2300 (R1)\n\n\n(R2)\n\n\nR1/R2\n\n\nepitope?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0093-F09\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n32.7\n\n\n0.18\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0111-C12\n\n\n38.8\n\n\n65.1\n\n\n0.60\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0137-E01\n\n\n20.8\n\n\n49.1\n\n\n0.42\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0109-F02\n\n\n9.5\n\n\n30.2\n\n\n0.31\n\n\npartial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0114-G06\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n27.5\n\n\n0.17\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0098-E09\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n34.8\n\n\n0.24\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0139-A09\n\n\n25.7\n\n\n40.0\n\n\n0.64\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0134-D07\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n14.7\n\n\n0.16\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0117-F04\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n29.7\n\n\n0.23\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0098-E09\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n29.9\n\n\n0.28\n\n\npartial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0136-A07\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n27.6\n\n\n0.18\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0112-D07\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n0.19\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0131-F07\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n27.6\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(DX-2300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMechanisms of hK1 Inhibition and K\ni \nDeterminations For Selected Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the best antibodies discovered are tight binding inhibitors of hK1, the classical Michaelis-Menten approach to determine enzyme inhibition mechanisms does not apply. A method to determine the inhibition mechanism of a tight binding inhibitor has been described (R. A. Copeland, “Enzymes”, 2\nnd \nEdition, Wiley, Toronto, 2000). Tight binding inhibitors refer to those inhibitors with inhibition constants (K\ni \nvalues) that approach the minimum enzyme concentration that can be used to measure activity, which for hK1 is approximately 1 nM. The tight binding inhibition method requires one to measure the IC\n50 \nof the inhibitor at a range of different substrate concentrations. Under these conditions, an inhibitor that binds the enzyme in a manner that is competitive with respect to substrate will exhibit a linear increase in IC\n50 \nin response to substrate concentration. In contrast, IC\n50 \nvalues that do not vary with substrate concentration are indicate that the inhibitor binds the enzyme in a manner that is noncompetitive with respect to substrate. The binding of a noncompetitive inhibitor to an enzyme does not block the ability of substrate to bind enzyme but rather prevents the subsequent substrate hydrolysis step, presumably through a distortion of the catalytically important amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDX-2300 exhibits a linear dependence of the IC\n50 \nvalue on substrate concentration (\nFIG. 2\n). Consequently, DX-2300 is a tight binding inhibitor that inhibits hK1 in a competitive manner, which indicates that its binding to hK1 prevent substrate binding. Knowledge of the inhibition mechanism also permits the determination of the inhibition constant (K\ni\n) DX-2300 has a K\ni \nvalue of 60 pM as a Fab and approximately 39 pM as an IgG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition mechanisms and K\ni \nvalues were also determined for the selected backup antibodies, M0093-F09 and M0137-E01. As shown in \nFIG. 3A\n, M0093-F09 inhibits hK1 in a noncompetitive manner with a K\ni \nof 1.9 nM. \nFIG. 3B\n demonstrates that the backup antibody inhibitor M0137-E01 inhibits hK1 in a competitive manner with a K\ni \nof 0.9 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress Curve Inhibition Analysis of DX-2300\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe time dependence of DX-2300 inhibition of hK1 was investigated using the progress curve method (R. A. Copeland, “Enzymes”, 2\nnd \nEdition, Wiley, Toronto, 2000). This method is used to characterize the kinetic step or steps that describe the interaction between inhibitor and enzyme. The progress curves shown in \nFIG. 4A\n demonstrate time dependent inhibition of hK1 by DX-2300 and the data obtained for each concentration of inhibitor were fit to provide exponential rate constants that describe the kinetics of the interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor. These rate constants (k\nobs \nvalues) when plotted against inhibitor concentration exhibit a hyperbolic dependence (\nFIG. 4B\n), which indicates that the initial complex between DX-2300 and hK1 undergoes an isomerization to form a new complex of even higher affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDX-2300 Inhibition of Kallikrein-Like Activity in Animal Urine\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTissue kallikrein (K1) has been previously shown to be excreted in urine. Kizuki, K., et al., \nAdv Exp Med Biol, \n1986. 198 Pt A:329-337; Takaoka, M., et al., \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun, \n1984. 122(3):1282-1288; Murthy, K. K., et al., \nArch Biochem Biophys, \n1986. 244(2):563-571; Stella, R. C., et al., \nAdv Exp Med Biol, \n1989. 247B:195-200. Using synthetic peptide substrates the activity of K1 can be measured in urine. Often much of the excreted K1 is in the inactive proform so it is necessary to activate the enzyme with another protease such as trypsin or thermolysin. Prior to measuring the activity of K1 in the urine the activating enzyme is quenched using a specific inhibitor (soybean trypsin inhibitor for trypsin or phosphoramidon for thermolysin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom \nFIG. 5\n, it is evident that DX-2300 inhibits the kallikrein-like activity present in the urine of humans, sheep, dogs, monkeys, rabbits, and cows. However, it does not inhibit the kallikrein-like activity observed in rodents (mice, rats, guinea pigs, or hamsters) or from pig urine. The measured DX-2300IC\n50 \nvalues for kallikrein-like activity in sheep urine and human urine are comparable at 2.9±1.6 nM and 3.0±0.6 nM, respectively (\nFIG. 6\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedure. Animal urine was first buffered by the addition of a 1/10 volume of 1 M HEPES, pH 7.7 and centrifuged to remove solids. The supernatant (1 mL) was then activated by the addition of 50 μL trypsin agarose resin for 30 minutes at 37° C. The sample was then centrifuged to remove the trypsin agarose and any residual trypsin that may have leached from the resin was inactivated with 10 μM soybean trypsin inhibitor. The kallikrein activity towards the synthetic substrate Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC (100 μM [final]) in activated urine (9 μL) was measured in Kal buffer (Table 4) wells of a 96 well plate (100 μL total volume) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM DX-2300. Activated urine was first incubated with DX-2300 for 30 minutes at 37° C. prior to the addition of substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of Kallikrein-Like Activity in Human Bronchial Alveolar Lavage\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTissue kallikrein 1 (hK1) has been shown to be elevated in the airways of asthmatic patients compared to healthy individuals as measured in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL). Proud, D. et al. \nAm J Respir Cell Mol Biol, \n1993. 8(1):16-19; Christiansen, S. C., et al., \nAm Rev Respir Dis, \n1992. 145(4 Pt 1):900-905; Christiansen, S. C., et al., \nJ Clin Invest, \n1987. 79(1):188-197. DX-2300 was found to inhibit kallikrein-like activity in BAL from 4 different mildly asthmatic patients as measured using the synthetic substrate, Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC. (See FIG. \n7\n)This synthetic substrate can be be hydrolyzed by other proteases in the BAL and is therefore not a selective substrate of kininogenase activity. Because DX-2300 has been shown to be a highly specific inhibitor of K1, it is unlikely to inhibit these other proteases in the BAL. Consequently, DX-2300 is not expected to completely inhibit the protease activity in BAL. The observation of a substantial amount of protease inhibition in BAL with such a specific inhibitor of K1 activity does confirm K1 activity is elevated from asthmatic patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffect of DX-2300 in Sheep Model of Asthma\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sheep model of asthma has been previously used to validate potential asthma drug targets and test agents. Forteza, R., et al., \nAm J Respir Crit. Care Med, \n1996. 154(1):36-42; Rosen, S. D., et al., \nAm J Pathol, \n2005. 166(3):935-944; Scuri, M., et al., \nJ Appl Physiol, \n2002. 93(6):1900-1906. In this model allergic sheep are challenged with \nAscaris suum \nantigen and measurements of pulmonary resistance provide an indication of the accompanying bronchoconstriction. As shown in \nFIG. 8A\n, DX-2300 slightly decreased early phase and inhibited the late phase bronchoconstriction by over 80%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements of the airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in the sheep model of asthma also indicate efficacy in human patients. As shown in \nFIG. 9B\n, DX-2300 completely blocked the AHR that follows allergen challenge. AHR is measured according to how much carbachol, a chlolinergic agonist, is required to increase \nbronchoconstriction\n 400% above baseline (PC400). Following allergen challenge the airways are hyper-responsive to such an agonist so the amount require to induce the same level of bronchoconstriction is reduced. \nFIG. 9B\n demonstrates that DX-2300 blocked the development of AHR because the same amount of carbachol was required after challenge to reach the PC400 level of bronchoconstriction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), a K1 substrate, to sheep by inhalation results in an immediate bronchoconstriction, as measured by an increase in lung resistance. This increase is due to the generation of kinins by the airway kininogenase. The observation that DX-2300 inhibits HMWK-induced bronchoconstriction (\nFIG. 10\n) supports the observation that K1 is the major kininogenase in the airway. Christiansen, S. C., et al., \nAm Rev Respir Dis, \n1992. 145(4 Pt 1):900-905; Lauredo, I. T., et al., \nAm J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, \n2004. 286(4):L734-40.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCodon Optimization of DNA Encoding the Heavy and Light Chains of DX-2300\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the heavy and light chains of DX-2300 were both optimized for expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by GENEART, experts in field, using a proprietary algorithm. During the optimization of the codon usage was adapted to the codon bias of Cricetulus genes. Regions of high (>80%) or low (<30%) GC content where avoided where possible. In addition, for the heavy chain 4 Procarya inhibitory motifs and 7 consensus cryptic splice donor sites were removed. For the light chain, the single intron was removed.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimized DX-2300 light chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1378)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAGCTTATGGGCTGGTCCTGTATCATCCTGTTTCTGGTGGCCACCGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCTCTGGCGTGAACTCCTCCAGACTGGAGGTGTGGACCTACATCTGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTGACCATGACCTCCACCCTGCCTTTCTCTCCAGGCGTGCACTCCGAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nATCCAGATGACCCAGTCCCCCTCTTCTCTGTCTGCCTCTGTGGGCGAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGAGTGACCATCACCTGTCGGGCCTCCCAGTCCATCTCCTCCTACCTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAACTGGTATCAGCAGAAGCCTGGCAAGGCTCCCAAGCTGCTGATCTAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCCGCTTCCTCTCTGCAGTCTGGCGTGCCTTCCAGATTCTCCGGCTCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGCTCTGGCACCGATTTCACCCTGACCATCTCCAGCCTGCAGCCTGAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGATTTCGCCACCTACTACTGCCAGCAGTCCTACTCTACCCCTCTGACC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTTGGCGGCGGAACAAAGGTGGAGATCAAGAGGACCGTGGCCGCTCCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTCCGTGTTCATCTTCCCCCCTTCCGACGAGCAGCTGAAGTCTGGCACC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCCTCTGTGGTGTGTCTGCTGAACAACTTCTACCCCCGGGAGGCCAAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTGCAGTGGAAGGTGGACAACGCCCTGCAGTCCGGCAATTCCCAGGAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTCTGTGACCGAGCAGGACTCCAAGGACAGCACCTACTCCCTGTCCTCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCCTGACCCTGTCCAAGGCCGACTACGAGAAGCACAAGGTGTACGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTGTGAGGTGACCCACCAGGGCCTGTCTAGCCCTGTGACCAAGTCCTTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAACCGGGGCGAGTGCTGATGAGAATTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimized DX-2300 Heavy Chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1379)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAGCTTATGGGCTGGTCCTGTATCATCCTGTTTCTGGTGGCCACCGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCGGCGCTCACTCTGAGGTGCAGCTGCTGGAGTCTGGCGGCGGACTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTGCAGCCTGGCGGCTCTCTGAGACTGTCTTGTGCCGCCTCCGGCTTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCTTCTCCAAGTACAAGATGGTGTGGGTGAGGCAGGCCCCTGGCAAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGCCTGGAGTGGGTGTCCTCCATCTACCCATCTGGCGGCATCACCGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTACGCCGATTCTGTGAAGGGCCGGTTCACCATCTCCCGGGACAACTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAGAACACCCTGTACCTGCAGATGAACTCCCTGAGAGCCGAGGATACC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCCATGTACTACTGTGCCAAGGACATCACCCCTGGCGGAGGATCTGGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTCCGGCTGCCCAAGAATTACTACTACTACGGCATGGATGTGTGGGGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAGGGCACCACCGTGACCGTGTCCTCTGCTTCTACCAAGGGCCCTTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTGTTTCCTCTGGCCCCTTCCTCCAAGTCTACCTCCGGCGGCACCGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCTCTGGGCTGCCTGGTGAAGGACTACTTCCCTGAGCCCGTGACAGTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTCTTGGAACTCTGGCGCTCTGACCTCTGGCGTGCACACCTTCCCTGCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTGCTGCAGTCCTCCGGCCTGTACTCTCTGTCCTCCGTGGTGACCGTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCTTCTTCTTCTCTGGGCACCCAGACCTACATCTGTAACGTGAACCAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAGCCCTCCAACACCAAGGTGGACAAGCGGGTGGAGCCTAAGTCCTGT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGACAAGACCCACACCTGCCCTCCCTGTCCTGCCCCTGAGCTGCTGGGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGACCTTCTGTGTTCCTGTTCCCCCCCAAGCCTAAGGACACCCTGATG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nATCTCCAGGACCCCTGAGGTGACCTGTGTGGTGGTGGACGTGTCTCAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAGGATCCCGAGGTGAAGTTCAACTGGTACGTGGACGGCGTGGAGGTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCACAACGCCAAGACCAAGCCTAGGGAGGAGCAGTACAACTCCACCTAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCGGGTGGTGTCTGTGCTGACCGTGCTGCACCAGGATTGGCTGAACGGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAGGAATACAAGTGTAAGGTGTCCAACAAGGCCCTGCCTGCCCCCATC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAGAAAACCATCTCCAAGGCCAAGGGCCAGCCTCGGGAGCCTCAGGTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTACACCCTGCCTCCTAGCAGGGAGGAGATGACCAAGAACCAGGTGTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTGACCTGTCTGGTGAAGGGCTTCTACCCTTCCGATATCGCCGTGGAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTGGGAGTCTAATGGCCAGCCCGAGAACAACTACAAGACCACCCCTCCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTGCTGGACTCTGACGGCTCCTTCTTCCTGTACTCCAAGCTGACCGTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGACAAGTCCAGATGGCAGCAGGGCAACGTGTTCTCCTGCTCCGTGATG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCACGAGGCCCTGCACAATCACTACACCCAGAAGTCCCTGTCTCTGTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCCGGCAAGTGATGAGAATTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents of the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.
