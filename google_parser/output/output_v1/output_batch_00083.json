Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to a class of azetidine derivatives which are inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase, (FAAH), and which are useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions which benefit from inhibition of FAAH activity, such as anxiety, depression pain, inflammation, and eating, sleep, neurodegenerative and movement disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe endogenous agonists of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 include the fatty acid amide anandamide (AEA). AEA is hydrolysed to arachidonic acid by the membrane bound protein fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). FAAH was characterized in 1996 by Cravatt and co-workers (Cravatt, Nature 1996, 384, 83). It was subsequently determined that FAAH is additionally responsible for the catabolism of a large number of important lipid signaling fatty acid amides including: another major endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) (Science 1992, 258, 1946-1949); the sleep-inducing substance, oleamide (Science 1995, 268, 1506); the appetite-suppressing agent, N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA) (Rodriguez de Fonesca, Nature 2001, 414, 209); and the anti-inflammatory agent, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (Lambert, Curr. Med. Chem. 2002, 9(6), 663).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of FAAH are being sought since such inhibitors elevate the concentrations of these endogenous signaling lipids and thereby produce associated beneficial pharmacological effects. There have been some reports of the effects of various FAAH inhibitors in pre-clinical models. Those effects include analgesic properties (see WO 02/087569, WO 04/033652); anxiety (Kathuria, Nat. Med. 2003, 9(1), 76); spasticity (Baker, FASEB J. 2001, 15(2), 300).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of research on the effects of certain exogenous cannabinoids also suggest that a FAAH inhibitor may be useful for treating various conditions, diseases, disorders, or symptoms. These include pain, nausea/emesis, anorexia, spasticity, movement disorders, epilepsy and glaucoma. To date, approved therapeutic uses for cannabinoids include the relief of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis among patients with cancer and appetite enhancement in patients with HIV/AIDS who experience anorexia as a result of wasting syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApart from the approved indications, a therapeutic field that has received much attention for cannabinoid use is analgesia, i.e., the treatment of pain. Five small randomized controlled trials showed that tetrahydrocannabinol THC is superior to placebo, producing dose-related analgesia (Robson, Br. J. Psychiatry 2001, 178, 107-115).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of individuals with multiple sclerosis have claimed a benefit from cannabis for both disease-related pain and spasticity, with support from small controlled trials (Svendsen, Br. Med. J. 2004, 329, 253). Likewise, various victims of spinal cord injuries, such as paraplegia, have reported that their painful spasms are alleviated after smoking marijuana. A report showing that cannabinoids appear to control spasticity and tremor in the CREAE model of multiple sclerosis demonstrated that these effects are mediated by CB1 and CB2 receptors (Baker, Nature 2000, 404, 84-87). Phase 3 clinical trials have been undertaken in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury patients with a narrow ratio mixture of tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCannabinoids produced dose-related reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) and therefore may relieve glaucoma symptoms. Ophthalmologists have prescribed cannabis for patients with glaucoma in whom other drugs have failed to adequately control intraocular pressure (Robson, 2001 supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the effects of a FAAH inhibitor on AEA and other endocannabinoids, inhibitors of FAAH's catabolism of other lipid mediators may be used in treating other therapeutic indications. For example, PEA has demonstrated biological effects in animal models of inflammation, immunosuppression, analgesia, and neuroprotection (Ueda, J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276(38), 35552). Oleamide, another substrate of FAAH, induces sleep (Boger, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000, 97(10), 5044; Mendelson, Neuropsychopharmacology 2001, 25, S36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitors are considered potentially useful in treating Alzheimer's Disease, schizophrenia, depression, alcoholism, addiction, suicide, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke, emesis, miscarriage, embryo implantation, endotoxic shock, liver cirrhosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, traumatic head injury, glaucoma, and bone cement implantation syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther diseases or medical conditions that would potentially benefit from inhibition of FAAH activity, include, for example, multiple sclerosis, retinitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, immunodeficiency virus-induced encephalitis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, pain, nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, non-inflammatory pain, painful hemorrhagic cystitis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, metabolic disorders, feeding and fasting, alteration of appetite, stress, memory, aging, hypertension, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, intestinal inflammation and motility, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, diarrhea, ileitis, ischemia, cerebral ischemia, hepatic ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral excitotoxicity, seizures, febrile seizures, neurotoxicity, neuropathies, sleep, induction of sleep, prolongation of sleep, insomnia, and inflammatory diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurological and psychological diseases or conditions that would potentially benefit from inhibition of FAAH activity include, for example, pain, depression, anxiety, glaucoma, nausea, emesis, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, respiratory disorders, allergies, traumatic brain injury, stroke, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorders, stress; stress urinary incontinence, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, schizophrenia, psychosis, Parkinson's disease, muscle spasticity, epilepsy, dyskinesia, seizure disorders, jet lag, and insomnia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther diseases or medical conditions that would potentially benefit from inhibition of FAAH activity, include, for example, a variety of metabolic syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to, insulin resistance syndrome, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, obesity, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitors are potentially useful in the treatment of a variety of painful syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to those characterized by non-inflammatory pain, inflammatory pain, peripheral neuropathic pain, central pain, differentiation pain, chronic nociceptive pain, stimulus of nociceptive receptors, phantom and transient acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH activity can also potentially be used in the treatment of a variety of conditions involving inflammation. These conditions include, but are not limited to arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder tendonitis or bursitis, gouty arthritis, and aolymyalgia rheumatica), organ-specific inflammatory diseases (such as thyroiditis, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases), asthma, other autoimmune diseases (such as multiple sclerosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitors are potentially useful in preventing neurodegeneration or for neuroprotection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it has been shown that when FAAH activity is reduced or absent, one of its substrates, anandamide, acts as a substrate for COX-2, which converts anandamide to prostamides (Weber et al. J. Lipid. Res. 2004; 45:757). Concentrations of certain prostamides may be elevated in the presence of a FAAH inhibitor. Certain prostamides are associated with reduced intraocular pressure and ocular hypotensivity. Thus, FAAH inhibitors may be useful for treating glaucoma.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention makes available a class of azetidine derivatives, more fully defined and described below, having FAAH inhibitory activity. The compounds of the invention are useful for treatment of diseases or medical conditions which benefits from inhibition of FAAH activity. Such diseases or conditions have been described above.

Typical literature sources are “\nAdvanced organic chemistry”, \n4\nth \nEdition (Wiley), J March, “\nComprehensive Organic Transformation”, \n2\nnd \nEdition (Wiley), R. C. Larock, “\nHandbook of Heterocyclic Chemistry”, \n2\nnd \nEdition (Pergamon), A. R. Katritzky), review articles such as found in “\nSynthesis”, “Acc. Chem. Res.”, “Chem. Rev\n”, or primary literature sources identified by standard literature searches online or from secondary sources such as “\nChemical Abstracts\n” or “\nBeilstein\n”. Such literature methods include those of the preparative Examples herein, and methods analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an azetidine of formula (II) or a salt thereof may be reacted with an isocyanate of formula (III) to provide compounds of the invention.

In general, a suitable dose for orally administrable formulations will usually be in the range of 0.1 to 3000 mg, once, twice or three times per day, or the equivalent daily amount administered by injection, inhalation, infusion or other routes. However, optimum dose levels and frequency of dosing will be determined by clinical trials as is conventional in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds with which the invention is concerned may be prepared for administration by any route consistent with their pharmacokinetic properties. The orally administrable compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, liquid or gel preparations. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone; fillers for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricant, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants for example potato starch, or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. Other particular formulations for oral administration include chewing gums, and suckable lozenges and lollipops, containing the compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical application to the skin, the drug may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. Cream or ointment formulations which may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example as described in standard textbooks of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia. Methods of delivery via sustained release patches for application to the skin are also known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredient may also be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. Depending on the vehicle and concentration used, the drug can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredient may also be formulated for inhalation, for example as a nasal spray, or dry powder or aerosol inhalers. For delivery by inhalation, the active compound is preferably in the form of microparticles. They may be prepared by a variety of techniques, including spray-drying, freeze-drying and micronization. Aerosol generation can be carried out using, for example, pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, preferably using propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from, for example, inhalation capsules or other “dry powder” delivery systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may be administered together with other classes of pharmaceutically active drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples illustrate the preparation and activities of specific compounds of the invention and are not intended to be limiting of the full scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nPart A\n\n\nExamples 1-4\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1\nH (400 MHz) and \n13\nC (100 MHz) Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed using a Bruker DPX-400 MHz NMR spectrometer.

The coding sequence of amino acids 30-579 of rat FAAH were cloned into the expression vector pET28a to provide an N-terminal His-tag. Following expression, the His-tagged FAAH (30-579) was isolated using a method based on Patricelli et al., 1998; Biochemistry vol 37, p 15177 with a combination of chelating sepharose, heparin sepharose and size exclusion chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH activity was determined by measuring the liberation of the highly fluorescent 7-amino, 4-methyl Coumarin (AMC) generated during hydrolysis of the substrate Arachidonoyl 7-Amino, 4-methyl Coumarin Amide (AAMCA) by FAAH. Inhibition of FAAH activity was determined as a percentage reduction of the fluorescence determined in the absence of compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay was carried out in black-walled, clear bottom, 384-well plates. 27.5 μl of FAAH protein (in FAAH assay buffer: 50 mM Hepes, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA (fatty-acid-free), pH 8.2) was pre-incubated, at 120 nM, with increasing concentrations of compounds (2.5 μl in 100% DMSO) for 0, 1 or 3 hours at room temperature. 2.5 μl of DMSO was added for ‘total’ controls (100% FAAH activity) and 2.5 μl of URB-597, a known inhibitor of FAAH activity, (at a final, saturating, concentration of 10 μM) was used for ‘non-specific’ controls (0 FAAH activity). 20 μl of 7.5 μM AAMCA substrate (in FAAH assay buffer) was then added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for a further 1.5 hours. Fluorescence was determined at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm using a Flexstation plate reader (Molecular Devices, UK). Inhibition of FAAH activity, by the compounds, was determined as the percentage reduction in relative fluorescence units (RFU) compared to the ‘total’ controls (in the absence of compound) minus the ‘non-specific’ controls. IC\n50 \nvalues were determined, from 10-point dose response curves, in XL-Fit using a 4-Parameter Logistic Model (Sigmoidal Dose-Response Model).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Table 1 provides the 3-hour incubation results of testing the compounds of Examples 1-4 herein in the above rat FAAH inhibition assay.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFAAH Rat IC50 (nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample No\n\n\n180 minutes\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n279\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n135\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n77\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n67\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart B\n\n\nHuman FAAH 1 Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman FAAH 1 activity was determined by measuring the liberation of the highly fluorescent 7-amino, 4-methyl Coumarin (AMC) generated during hydrolysis of the substrate arachidonoyl 7-amino, 4-methyl coumarin amide (AAMCA) by FAAH.

After 3 h, thermal pain sensitivity was reassessed in treated and untreated hind paws prior to dosing with test compound or vehicle. Indomethacin was administered as a positive control.\n\n\n \nProcedure\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Sprague Dawley rats were tail-marked, and acclimatized to the plantar boxes on 3 separate occasions (6, 5 and 1 day prior to the test day) for at least 5 min on each occasion. On the pre-test day, the rats were habituated to the test room for at least 30 min prior to testing. The rats were put into the Hargreaves plantar boxes, allowed to settle down for approx 3-5 min, and challenged with the mobile radiant heat source. The latency to withdraw both left and right hindpaws from the heat source was determined on 2 occasions (3 min apart). The mean across the 2 challenges was recorded as the baseline for each animal. Rats 18 and 30 were not used in the study as they had very high baseline readings, and they were replaced by 61 and 63. Rats were then allocated to drug treatments ensuring the baseline latencies were balanced across groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the test day, rats received intraplantar carrageenan lambda (100 uL of 1% in saline), or saline in right hindpaw 3 hours before testing. Four hours before testing, rats received VER-158416 (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle (5% EtOH: 95% (1% methylcellulose in water) p.o. Subsequently, 30 min before testing, rats received a second injection of either indomethacin 10 mg/kg or vehicle (50% 0.1M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n:47.5% phosphate buffered saline (PBS): 2.5% 1M HCl) i.p. At the scheduled test time following drug treatment, the latency to withdraw the paw from the radiant heat source was reassessed by a single reading.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the compound of Example 13 above was tested as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats were dosed with intraplantar carrageenan at t=0; the compound of Example 13 (1, 3 & 10 mg/kg po) or vehicle (5% EtOH: 95% (1% methylcellulose in water) at t=2 h; indomethacin (10 mg/kg ip) or vehicle at t=2.5 h and thermal sensitivity was measured at t=3 h. Thus all rats received both oral and ip dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of Example 13 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg p.o.) caused a dose-related inhibition of carrageenan-induced thermal hypersensitivity, which reached statistical significance (cf. vehicle/carrageenan group; one way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests) at 3 and 10 mg/kg doses. The compound did not reduce pain sensitivity to below normal levels, and had no effect on contralateral paw sensitivities to thermal pain. The maximum effect of the compound was similar to that of the positive control indomethacin.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nHargreaves, K., Dubner, R., Brown, F., Flores, C., Joris, J., (1988).

No. 61/466,679, filed Mar. 23, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/361,808, filed Jul. 6, 2010; the contents of each application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe field of the invention is molecular biology, immunology and oncology. More particularly, the field is therapeutic antibodies.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nRecepteur d' Origine Nantais (RON), also known as Macrophage Stimulating Protein Receptor (MSP R, or MST1-R), is a member of the MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases that binds the ligand known as Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP). RON is composed of a 40 kDa extracellular α chain and a 150 kDa transmembrane β chain. The β chain is responsible for the intrinsic kinase activity, and the extracellular portions of the two chains function together as the ligand binding domain (Wagh et al., 2008, A\nDV\n. C\nANCER \nR\nES. \n100:1-33).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMSP binding to RON activates multiple downstream signaling pathways and mediates multiple cellular activities. RON pathway dysregulation is involved in inflammatory response, wound healing and liver regeneration. RON signaling can sustain tumor growth, survival, motility, invasion and angiogenesis in certain malignancies. The RON protein exists in several splice variants, some of which are tumorigenic in animal models of cancer. One such splice variant is delta 160 RON, which lacks \nexons\n 5 and 6 (Lu et al., 2007, C\nANCER \nL\nETT. \n257:157-164).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen activated by ligand binding, RON activates the PI3K/AKT pathway and the MAPK pathway. RON also affects cells through interactions with other receptors, e.g., c-Met, integrins and EGFR. To date, no activating mutations in RON exons have been reported. Alternative splicing and overexpression appear to be the main mechanisms for constitutive activation of the receptor. Several small molecule inhibitors have been reported that inhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including RON, examples of which include EXCEL-2880, (Qian et al., 2009, C\nANCER \nR\nES. \n69:8009-8016) and BMS-77607 (Schroeder et al., 2009 J. M\nED \nC\nHEM. \n52:1251-1254). A dual c-met/RON inhibitor has also been reported, Amgen compound I (Zhang et al., 2008, C\nANCER \nR\nES. \n68:6680-6687). A recent publication describes a selective RON small molecule inhibitor (Raeppel et al., 2010 B\nIOORG \nM\nED \nC\nHEM \nL\nETT \n20:2745-9). Several antibodies that inhibit human RON activity have been reported (Huet et al., US 2009/0226442; Pereira et al., US 2009/0136510; Zhu et al., WO 2006/020258; Pereira et al., WO 2005/120557; and commercial antibody MAB691, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring antibodies are multimeric proteins that contain four polypeptide chains (\nFIG. 1\n). Two of the polypeptide chains are called heavy chains (H chains), and two of the polypeptide chains are called light chains (L chains). The immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are connected by an interchain disulfide bond. The immunoglobulin heavy chains are connected by interchain disulfide bonds. A light chain consists of one variable region (V\nL \nin \nFIG. 1\n) and one constant region (C\nL \nin \nFIG. 1\n). The heavy chain consists of one variable region (V\nH \nin \nFIG. 1\n) and at least three constant regions (CH\n1\n, CH\n2 \nand CH\n3 \nin \nFIG. 1\n). The variable regions determine the specificity of the antibody. Each variable region comprises three hypervariable regions also known as complementarity determining regions (CDRs) flanked by four relatively conserved framework regions (FRs). The three CDRs, referred to as CDR\n1\n, CDR\n2\n, and CDR\n3\n, contribute to the antibody binding specificity. Naturally occurring antibodies have been used as starting material for engineered antibodies, such as chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough antibodies that bind RON are known in the art, there is still a need for improved RON antibodies that can be used as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is based, in part, upon the discovery of a family of antibodies that specifically bind human RON. The antibodies contain RON binding sites based on the CDRs of the antibodies. The antibodies can be used as therapeutic agents. When used as therapeutic agents, the antibodies are engineered, e.g., humanized, to reduce or eliminate an immune response when administered to a human patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies prevent or inhibit the activation of (i.e., neutralize) human RON. In some embodiments, the antibodies prevent RON from binding to its ligand, MSP, thereby neutralizing RON activity. In certain embodiments, the antibodies prevent RON activation without inhibiting RON binding to MSP. The antibodies can be used to inhibit the downstream signaling of the breast tumor cell line T47D. Furthermore, when administered to a mammal, the antibodies can inhibit or reduce tumor growth in the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following figures, detailed description, and claims.

The search parameters for histogram, descriptions, alignments, expect (i.e., the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences), cutoff, matrix and filter are at the default settings. The default scoring matrix used by blastp, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx is the BLOSUM62 matrix (Henikoff et al., (1992) P\nROC\n. N\nATL\n. A\nCAD\n. S\nCI\n. USA 89, 10915-10919, fully incorporated by reference). Four blastn parameters may be adjusted as follows: Q=10 (gap creation penalty); R=10 (gap extension penalty); wink=1 (generates word hits at every wink.sup.th position along the query); and gapw=16 (sets the window width within which gapped alignments are generated). The equivalent Blastp parameter settings may be Q=9; R=2; wink=1; and gapw=32. Searches may also be conducted using the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) BLAST Advanced Option parameter (e.g.: -G, Cost to open gap [Integer]: default=5 for nucleotides/11 for proteins; -E, Cost to extend gap [Integer]: default=2 for nucleotides/1 for proteins; -q, Penalty for nucleotide mismatch [Integer]: default=−3; -r, reward for nucleotide match [Integer]: default=1; -e, expect value [Real]: default=10; -W, wordsize [Integer]: default=11 for nucleotides/28 for megablast/3 for proteins; -y, propoff (X) for blast extensions in bits: default=20 for blastn/7 for others; -X, X dropoff value for gapped alignment (in bits): default=15 for all programs, not applicable to blastn; and -Z, final X dropoff value for gapped alignment (in bits): 50 for blastn, 25 for others). ClustalW for pairwise protein alignments may also be used (default parameters may include, e.g., Blosum62 matrix and Gap Opening Penalty=10 and Gap Extension Penalty=0.1). A Bestfit comparison between sequences, available in the GCG package version 10.0, uses DNA parameters GAP=50 (gap creation penalty) and LEN=3 (gap extension penalty) and the equivalent settings in protein comparisons are GAP=8 and LEN=2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each of the foregoing embodiments, it is contemplated herein that immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region sequences and/or light chain variable region sequences that together bind human RON may contain amino acid alterations (e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions) in the framework regions of the heavy and/or light chain variable regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antibody binds human RON with a K\nD \nof 1 nM, 900 pM, 750 pM, 650 pM, 600 pM, 500 pM, 400 pM, 300 pM, 250 pM, 200 pM, 150 pM, 100 pM, 50 pM or lower. Unless otherwise specified, K\nD \nvalues are determined by surface plasmon resonance methods under the conditions described in Examples 5 and 14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody Sh29B06-78 binds human RON with a K\nD \nof 500 pM, 250 pM, 200 pM, 150 pM, 100 pM or lower as measured by surface plasmon resonance methods under the conditions described in Examples 5 and 14. In an exemplary embodiment, antibody Sh29B06-78 binds human RON with a K\nD \nof 150 pM or lower as measured by surface plasmon resonance methods at 37° C. under the conditions described in Examples 5 and 14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody SH07F01-62 binds human RON with a K\nD \nof 500 pM, 400 pM, 350 pM, 300 pM, 250 pM, 200 pM, 150 pM, 100 pM or lower as measured by surface plasmon resonance methods under the conditions described in Examples 5 and 14. In an exemplary embodiment, antibody SH07F01-62 binds human RON with a K\nD \nof 250 pM to 350 pM or lower as measured by surface plasmon resonance methods at 37° C. under the conditions described in Examples 5 and 14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antibodies inhibit human MSP binding to human RON. For example, the antibodies can have an IC\n50 \n(concentration at 50% of maximum inhibition) of about 5 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM or lower, when assayed using the protocol described in Examples 8 and 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the embodiments illustrated in the Examples comprise pairs of variable regions, pairs of full length antibody chains, or pairs of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions, one from a heavy chain and one from a light chain, a skilled artisan will recognize that alternative embodiments may comprise single heavy chain variable regions or single light chain variable regions, single full length antibody chains, or CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions from one antibody chain, either heavy or light. The single variable region, full length antibody chain or CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 region of one chain can be used to screen for corresponding domains in another chain, the two chains capable of forming an antibody that binds antigen. The screening may be accomplished by phage display screening methods using, e.g., a hierarchical dual combinatorial approach disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO92/01047. In this approach, an individual colony containing either a heavy or light chain clone is used to infect a complete library of clones encoding the other chain (light or heavy), and the resulting two-chain specific antigen-binding domain is selected in accordance with phage display techniques as described.\n\n\n \nII. Production of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for producing antibodies, such as those disclosed herein, are known in the art. For example, DNA molecules encoding light chain variable regions and/or heavy chain variable regions can be chemically synthesized using the sequence information provided herein. Synthetic DNA molecules can be ligated to other appropriate nucleotide sequences, including, e.g., constant region coding sequences, and expression control sequences, to produce conventional gene expression constructs encoding the desired antibodies. Production of defined gene constructs is within routine skill in the art. Alternatively, the sequences provided herein can be cloned out of hybridomas by conventional hybridization techniques or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, using synthetic nucleic acid probes whose sequences are based on sequence information provided herein, or prior art sequence information regarding genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies in hybridoma cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding desired antibodies can be incorporated (ligated) into expression vectors, which can be introduced into host cells through conventional transfection or transformation techniques. Exemplary host cells are \nE. coli \ncells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), and myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce IgG protein. Transformed host cells can be grown under conditions that permit the host cells to express the genes that encode the immunoglobulin light and/or heavy chain variable regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific expression and purification conditions will vary depending upon the expression system employed. For example, if a gene is to be expressed in \nE. coli\n, it is first cloned into an expression vector by positioning the engineered gene downstream from a suitable bacterial promoter, e.g., Trp or Tac, and a prokaryotic signal sequence. The expressed secreted protein accumulates in refractile or inclusion bodies, and can be harvested after disruption of the cells by French press or sonication. The refractile bodies then are solubilized, and the proteins refolded and cleaved by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the engineered gene is to be expressed in eukayotic host cells, e.g., CHO cells, it is first inserted into an expression vector containing a suitable eukaryotic promoter, a secretion signal, IgG enhancers, and various introns. This expression vector optionally contains sequences encoding all or part of a constant region, enabling an entire, or a part of, a heavy or light chain to be expressed. The gene construct can be introduced into eukaryotic host cells using conventional techniques. The host cells express V\nL \nor V\nH \nfragments, V\nL\n-V\nH \nheterodimers, V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nH \nsingle chain polypeptides, complete heavy or light immunoglobulin chains, or portions thereof, each of which may be attached to a moiety having another function (e.g., cytotoxicity). In some embodiments, a host cell is transfected with a single vector expressing a polypeptide expressing an entire, or part of, a heavy chain (e.g., a heavy chain variable region) or a light chain (e.g., a light chain variable region). In other embodiments, a host cell is transfected with a single vector encoding (a) a polypeptide comprising a heavy chain variable region and a polypeptide comprising a light chain variable region, or (b) an entire immunoglobulin heavy chain and an entire immunoglobulin light chain. In still other embodiments, a host cell is co-transfected with more than one expression vector (e.g., one expression vector expressing a polypeptide comprising an entire, or part of, a heavy chain or heavy chain variable region, and another expression vector expressing a polypeptide comprising an entire, or part of, a light chain or light chain variable region).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region or light chain variable region can be produced by growing a host cell transfected with an expression vector encoding such variable region, under conditions that permit expression of the polypeptide. Following expression, the polypeptide can be harvested and purified using techniques well known in the art, e.g., affinity tags such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and histidine tags.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA monoclonal antibody that binds human RON, or an antigen-binding fragment of the antibody, can be produced by growing a host cell transfected with: (a) an expression vector that encodes a complete or partial immunoglobulin heavy chain, and a separate expression vector that encodes a complete or partial immunoglobulin light chain; or (b) a single expression vector that encodes both chains (e.g., complete or partial heavy and light chains), under conditions that permit expression of both chains. The intact antibody (or antigen-binding fragment) can be harvested and purified using techniques well known in the art, e.g., Protein A, Protein G, affinity tags such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and histidine tags. It is within ordinary skill in the art to express the heavy chain and the light chain from a single expression vector or from two separate expression vectors.\n\n\n \nIII. Antibody Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for reducing or eliminating the antigenicity of antibodies and antibody fragments are known in the art. When the antibodies are to be administered to a human, the antibodies preferably are “humanized” to reduce or eliminate antigenicity in humans. Preferably, the humanized antibodies have the same or substantially the same affinity for the antigen as the non-humanized mouse antibody from which it was derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one humanization approach, chimeric proteins are created in which mouse immunoglobulin constant regions are replaced with human immunoglobulin constant regions. See, e.g., Morrison et al., 1984, P\nROC\n. N\nAT\n. A\nCAD\n. S\nCI. \n81:6851-6855, Neuberger et al., 1984, N\nATURE \n312:604-608; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,893,625 (Robinson); 5,500,362 (Robinson); and 4,816,567 (Cabilly).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an approach known as CDR grafting, the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions are grafted into frameworks from another species. For example, murine CDRs can be grafted into human FRs. In some embodiments, the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of an anti-RON antibody are grafted into human FRs or consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs, FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences are aligned to identify a consensus amino acid sequence. CDR grafting is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,022,500 (Queen); 6,982,321 (Winter); 6,180,370 (Queen); 6,054,297 (Carter); 5,693,762 (Queen); 5,859,205 (Adair); 5,693,761 (Queen); 5,565,332 (Hoogenboom); 5,585,089 (Queen); 5,530,101 (Queen); Jones et al. (1986) N\nATURE \n321: 522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) N\nATURE \n332: 323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) S\nCIENCE \n239: 1534-1536; and Winter (1998) F\nEBS \nL\nETT \n430: 92-94.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an approach called “SUPERHUMANIZATION™,” human CDR sequences are chosen from human germline genes, based on the structural similarity of the human CDRs to those of the mouse antibody to be humanized. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,881,557 (Foote); and Tan et al., 2002, J. I\nMMUNOL. \n169:1119-1125.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods to reduce immunogenicity include “reshaping,” “hyperchimerization,” and “veneering/resurfacing.” See, e.g., Vaswami et al., 1998, A\nNNALS OF \nA\nLLERGY\n, A\nSTHMA\n, & I\nMMUNOL. \n81:105; Roguska et al., 1996, P\nROT\n. E\nNGINEER \n9:895-904; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,035 (Hardman). In the veneering/resurfacing approach, the surface accessible amino acid residues in the murine antibody are replaced by amino acid residues more frequently found at the same positions in a human antibody. This type of antibody resurfacing is described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,641 (Pedersen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach for converting a mouse antibody into a form suitable for medical use in humans is known as ACTIVMAB™ technology (Vaccinex, Inc., Rochester, N.Y.), which involves a vaccinia virus-based vector to express antibodies in mammalian cells. High levels of combinatorial diversity of IgG heavy and light chains are said to be produced. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,706,477 (Zauderer); 6,800,442 (Zauderer); and 6,872,518 (Zauderer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach for converting a mouse antibody into a form suitable for use in humans is technology practiced commercially by KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.). This technology involves the use of a proprietary human “acceptor” library to produce an “epitope focused” library for antibody selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach for modifying a mouse antibody into a form suitable for medical use in humans is HUMAN ENGINEERING™ technology, which is practiced commercially by XOMA (US) LLC. See, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 93/11794 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,766,886 (Studnicka); 5,770,196 (Studnicka); 5,821,123 (Studnicka); and 5,869,619 (Studnicka).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable approach, including any of the above approaches, can be used to reduce or eliminate human immunogenicity of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it is possible to create fully human antibodies in mice. Fully human mAbs lacking any non-human sequences can be prepared from human immunoglobulin transgenic mice by techniques referenced in, e.g., Lonberg et al., N\nATURE \n368:856-859, 1994; Fishwild et al., N\nATURE \nB\nIOTECHNOLOGY \n14:845-851, 1996; and Mendez et al., N\nATURE \nG\nENETICS \n15:146-156, 1997. Human mAbs can also be prepared and optimized from phage display libraries by techniques referenced in, e.g., Knappik et al., J. M\nOL\n. B\nIOL. \n296:57-86, 2000; and Krebs et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 254:67-84 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the antibody is for use as a therapeutic, it can be conjugated to an effector agent such as a small molecule toxin or a radionuclide using standard in vitro conjugation chemistries. If the effector agent is a polypeptide, the antibody can be chemically conjugated to the effector or joined to the effector as a fusion protein. Construction of fusion proteins is within ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \nIV. Use of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies disclosed herein can be used to treat various forms of cancer, e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, breast, ovarian, prostate, cervical, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, gastric, and head and neck cancers. The cancer cells are exposed to a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody so as to inhibit or reduce proliferation of the cancer cell. In some embodiments, the antibodies inhibit cancer cell proliferation by at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the antibody (e.g., 07F01, 29B06, 17F06, 18H09, 12B11, sh29B06, sh07F01) inhibits or reduces proliferation of a tumor cell by inhibiting binding of human RON to its ligand, MSP. In some embodiments, the antibody (e.g., 07F01, 29B06, 17F06, 18H09, 12B11, sh29B06, sh07F01) inhibits or reduces proliferation of a tumor cell without inhibiting RON binding to MSP. The antibody (e.g., 07F01, 29B06, 17F06, 18H09, 12B11, sh29B06, sh07F01) can also be used in therapy. The antibody (e.g., 07F01, 29B06, 17F06, 18H09, 12B11, sh29B06, sh07F01) can be used to inhibit tumor growth in a mammal (e.g., a human patient). In some embodiments, use of the antibody to inhibit tumor growth in a mammal comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, antibody sh29B06-78 is used in therapy. For example, antibody sh29B06-78 can be used for inhibiting or reducing proliferation of a tumor cell. Antibody sh29B06-78 can also be used for inhibiting or reducing tumor growth in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, antibody sh07F01-62 is used in therapy. For example, antibody sh07F01-62 can be used for inhibiting or reducing proliferation of a tumor cell. Antibody sh07F01-62 can also be used for inhibiting or reducing tumor growth in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers associated with overexpression or inappropriate activation of RON include non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and some forms of brain cancer, melanomas, and gastrointestinal cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treat,” “treating” and “treatment” mean the treatment of a disease in a mammal, e.g., in a human. This includes: (a) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; and (b) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a therapeutically effective amount of active component is in the range of 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, e.g., 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. The amount administered will depend on variables such as the type and extent of disease or indication to be treated, the overall health of the patient, the in vivo potency of the antibody, the pharmaceutical formulation, and the route of administration. The initial dosage can be increased beyond the upper level in order to rapidly achieve the desired blood-level or tissue level. Alternatively, the initial dosage can be smaller than the optimum, and the dosage may be progressively increased during the course of treatment. Human dosage can be optimized, e.g., in a conventional Phase I dose escalation study designed to run from 0.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. Dosing frequency can vary, depending on factors such as route of administration, dosage amount and the disease being treated. Exemplary dosing frequencies are once per day, once per week and once every two weeks. In some embodiments, dosing is once every two weeks. A preferred route of administration is parenteral, e.g., intravenous infusion. Formulation of monoclonal antibody-based drugs is within ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the antibody is lyophilized and reconstituted in buffered saline at the time of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic use, an antibody preferably is combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means buffers, carriers, and excipients suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The carrier(s) should be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulations and not deleterious to the recipient. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include buffers, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, that are compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions containing antibodies, such as those disclosed herein, can be presented in a dosage unit form and can be prepared by any suitable method. A pharmaceutical composition should be formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration are intravenous (IV), intradermal, inhalation, transdermal, topical, transmucosal, and rectal administration. A preferred route of administration for monoclonal antibodies is IV infusion. Useful formulations can be prepared by methods well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing Company, 1990). Formulation components suitable for parenteral administration include a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as EDTA; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The carrier should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and should be preserved against microorganisms. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and suitable mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations preferably are sterile. Sterilization can be accomplished, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, filter sterilization can be conducted prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following Examples are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope or content of the invention in any way.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nProduction of Human RON Extracellular Domain (ECD)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis Example describes the production of the antigen, hRON ECD protein. The use of the full length ECD as the immunogen, allowed for the selection of two classes of hybridomas: (a) those producing antibodies that interact with the ligand binding domain, thereby inhibiting contact of the ligand to the receptor; and (b) those producing antibodies that bind outside the ligand binding domain, thereby inhibiting the receptor functions through mechanisms other than inhibition of ligand binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the extracellular domain of human RON (hRON ECD) (ref seq. NM\n—\n002447) was amplified by PCR and subcloned using the XmaI/EcoRI restriction sites in-frame into the pEE14.4 vector (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing THXmFC (Thrombin/His tag/Factor Xa-AJ mouse IgG-Fc), to produce a fusion protein. The resulting clone was linearized using the PvuI enzyme (NEBiolabs, Cat. No. R0150), then electroporated into CHO K1SVcells (Lonza). The electroporated cells were diluted in 200 ml CD CHO media (Gibco Cat. No. 10743-011). The next day, CD CHO media containing methionine sulfoximine (MSX) for a final concentration of 50 μM was added to the cells. After four weeks, positive clones were selected by sandwich ELISA in which the immobilized antibody was commercial monoclonal anti-hRON antibody MAB691 (R&D Systems), and the detection antibody was commercial polyclonal anti-hRON antibody AF691 (R&D Systems). Positive clones were re-transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 in a standard protocol. Cells were aliquoted into four separate shaker flasks and selected using 50 uM, 100 uM, 200 uM, and 400 uM MSX. After two weeks of selection, the individual flasks were checked for hRON-ECD protein expression by ELISA. The highest selection pressure, 400 μM MSX, yielded good protein expression and was chosen for scale-up and purification. Cells were grown for 2 weeks at 37° C. in BelloCell Bottles (Bellco Glass, Vineland, N.J.) at a concentration of 2-2.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml in CD CHO media, with a final concentration of 80 μM MSX for protein production. The resulting cells were spun down in 500 ml conical tubes for 15 minutes. The supernatant was filtered using vacuum filtration using a 0.45 micron filter and then a 0.22 micron filter. The protein was then batch bound to ProSepA beads (Millipore) at 4° C. overnight with rotation after adjusting the pH to 7.5. The beads were washed with 1×PBS and loaded onto disposable protein A affinity columns (Bio-Rad Econo-Pac columns; Bio-Rad cat. No. 732-1010). The beads were washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of glycine binding buffer (3M glycine ph 9.0, 1M NaCl). The protein was then eluted off the column using 5-10 CV of 200 mM glycine pH 2.5 acid elution buffer. The samples were then neutralized using 1.3 mL of 1.0 M Tris pH 8.0 neutralization buffer concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius Stedim Biotech).\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nAnti-RON Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThis Example describes the production of anti-hRON monoclonal antibodies. Immunizations, fusions, and primary screens were conducted at Maine Biotechnology Services Inc. (Portland, Me.), following the Repetitive Immunization Multiple Sites (RIMMS) protocol. Five AJ mice and five Balb/c mice were immunized with recombinant human RON extracellular domain (hRON-ECD). Two Balb/c mice with sera displaying the highest anti-RON activity by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were chosen for subsequent fusion. Spleens and lymph nodes from the appropriate mice were harvested. B-cells were harvested and fused with a myeloma line. Fusion products were serially diluted onto forty 96-well plates to near clonality.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 4,000 supernatants from the cell fusions were screened by ELISA for binding to recombinant hRON-ECD. A total of 158 supernatants containing antibodies against RON were further characterized by in vitro biochemical and cell-based assays, as described below. A panel of hybridomas was selected, subcloned and expanded. Hybridoma cell lines were transferred to BioXCell (West Lebanon, N.H.) for antibody expression and purification by affinity chromatography on Protein G resin, under standard conditions.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nScreening Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nA biochemical assay was carried out to identify antibodies that inhibit ligand binding. A cell-based assay was carried out to identify antibodies that inhibit MSP induced phosphoERK downstream signaling of the receptor. Antibodies that inhibited RON mediated cellular signaling were selected for further characterization regardless of whether they blocked ligand binding in the neutralization assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical neutralization assay measures inhibition of MSP binding to hRON by antibodies in hybridoma supernatants, using electrochemiluminescence (ECL). MA2400 96-well high binding plates (Meso Scale Discovery) were coated with 25 μl of 0.42 μg/mL hRON SEMA+PSI (an N-terminal portion of the ECD of hRON; R&D Systems) in PBS for one hour at room temperature with agitation. The plates were washed four times with PBS+0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), and blocked with 150 μl of charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). The hybridoma supernatant were added and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. After incubation, 5 μl of MSP (3 μg/mL) in charcoal stripped FBS was added to each well, and incubated for 45 minutes. The plate was washed four times with PBST, and 25 μl of 1 μg/mL biotinylated anti-MSP antibody (R&D Systems) was added to the plates for one hour at room temperature with agitation. The plates were washed four times with PBST, and incubated with 25 μl of 1 μg/mL ST-streptavidin (Meso Scale Discovery) for one hour at room temperature with agitation. The plates were washed four times with PBST, and 150 μl read buffer (Meso Scale Discovery) was added to each well before the plates were analyzed on a Sector Imager 2400 (Meso Scale Discovery) instrument. Antibodies 07F01, 18H09 and 29B06 each blocked MSP binding to hRON SEMA+PSI in this neutralization assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the cell-based assay, antibodies in the hybridoma supernatant were tested for inhibition of MSP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, which is a RON downstream signaling molecule. T47D cells were cultured in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640+10% FBS+insulin. Medium was removed, and cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 hours. Hybridoma supernatants containing RON antibodies were added to the cells at a dilution of 1:4 in-serum-free medium, and incubated for one hour at 37° C. MSP (5 nM) was added to the wells and incubated for 15 minutes. Medium was removed, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Total ERK and phospho-ERK were measured according to the vendor's instructions (R&D Systems, DY1018). Antibodies 07F01, 12B11, 17F06, 18H09 and 29B06 each inhibited MSP induced ERK phosphorylation in T47D cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein (see Examples 8 and 9), antibodies 07F01, 12B11, 17F06, 18H09 and 29B06 each inhibited MSP induced ERK phosphorylation in T47D cells, while only antibodies 07F01, 18H09 and 29B06 each blocked MSP binding to hRON SEMA+PSI in the neutralization assay. This suggests that antibodies 12B11 and 17F06 do not neutralize binding of MSP to the hRON SEMA+PSI domain, neutralize binding of MSP to RON in the context of the full RON extracellular domain, or function by a mechanism other than blocking MSP binding to RON.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nAntibody Sequence Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe light chain isotype and heavy chain isotype of each monoclonal antibody in Example 2 was determined using the IsoStrip™ Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Kit according the kit vendor's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.). All antibodies were found to be kappa or lambda light chain and IgG1 or IgG2a heavy chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heavy and light chain variable regions of the mouse monoclonal antibodies were sequenced using 5′ RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends). Total RNA was extracted from each monoclonal hybridoma cell line using the RNeasy® Miniprep kit according to the kit vendor's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). Full-length first strand cDNA containing 5′ ends was generated using either the GeneRacer™ Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) or SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.) according to the kit vendor's instructions using random primers for 5′ RACE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable regions of the light (kappa or lambda) and heavy (IgG1 or IgG2b) chains were amplified by PCR, using KOD Hot Start Polymerase (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, N.J.), Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science), or \nAdvantage\n 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech) according to the kit vendor's instructions. For amplification of 5′ cDNA ends in conjunction with the GeneRacer™ Kit, the \nGeneRacer™\n 5′ Primer, 5′ \ncgactggagcacgaggacactga\n 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 112) (Invitrogen) was used as a 5′ primer. For amplification of 5′ cDNA ends in conjunction with the SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit, the Universal Primer Mix A primer (Clontech), a mix of: 5′ \n \nCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 113) and 5′ \n \nCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 114), was used as a 5′ primer. Heavy chain variable regions were amplified using the above 5′ primers and a 3′ IgG1 constant region specific primer, 5′ \n \nTATGCAAGGCTTACAACCACA\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 115), or a 3′ IgG2a constant region specific primer, 5′ \n \nAGGACAGGGCTTGATTGTGGG\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 116). Kappa chain variable regions were amplified with the above 5′ primers and a 3′ kappa constant region specific primer, 5′ \n \nCTCATTCCTGTTGAAGCTCTTGACAAT\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 117). Lambda chain variable regions were amplified with the above 5′ primers and a mix of 3′ lambda constant region specific primers, 5′ \n \nGCACGGGACAAACTCTTCTC\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 118) and 5′ \n \nCACAGTGTCCCCTTCATGTG\n \n3′ (SEQ ID NO: 119).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual PCR products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the Qiaquick® Gel Purification kit according to the kit vendor's instructions (Qiagen). The PCR products were subsequently cloned into the pCR®4Blunt plasmid or pCR2.1®TOPO plasmid using the Zero Blunt® TOPO® PCR Cloning Kit or the TOPO® TA Cloning Kit, respectively, according to the kit vendor's instructions (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH5-α bacteria (Invitrogen) through standard molecular biology techniques. Plasmid DNA isolated from transformed bacterial clones was sequenced using M13 Forward (5′ \n \nGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT\n \n3′) (SEQ ID NO: 120) and M13 Reverse primers (5′ \n \nCAGGAAACAGCTATGACC\n \n3′) (SEQ ID NO: 121) by Beckman Genomics (Danvers, Mass.), using standard dideoxy DNA sequencing methods to identify the sequence of the variable region sequences. The sequences were analyzed using Vector NTI software (Invitrogen) and the IMGT/V-Quest web server (imgt.cines.fr) to identify and confirm variable region sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid sequences encoding and the protein sequences defining variable regions of the murine monoclonal antibodies are shown below (amino terminal signal peptide sequences are not shown).

Signal sequences for proper secretion of the antibodies (e.g., signal sequences at the 5′ end of the DNA sequences or the amino terminal end of the protein sequences) are not shown in the full length heavy and light chain sequences disclosed herein and are not included in the final secreted protein. Also not shown are stop codons for termination of translation required at the 3′ end of the DNA sequences. It is within ordinary skill in the art to select a signal sequence and/or a stop codon for expression of the disclosed full length IgG heavy chain and light chain sequences. It is also contemplated that the variable region sequences can be ligated to other constant region sequences to produce active full length IgG heavy and light chains.\n\n\n \n

standard protocol. Analyses were performed at 25° C. and 37° C., using PBS containing 0.05% surfactant P20 as running buffer. The antibodies were captured in individual flow cells at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Injection time was varied for each antibody to yield an Rmax between 30 and 60 RU. 250 μg/mL mouse Fc were injected at 30 μl/min for 120 seconds to block non-specific binding of antibodies to Fc portion of the protein when needed. Buffer, rhRon ECD/mFc or rhRON SEMA+PSI diluted in running buffer was injected sequentially over a reference surface (no antibody captured) and the active surface (antibody to be tested) for 300 seconds at 60 μl/minute. The dissociation phase was monitored for up to 3600 seconds. The surface was then regenerated with two 60-second injections of 10 mM Glycine-HCl, pH 1.7, at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. The rhRON ECD/mFc or rhRON SEMA+PSI concentration range tested was 0.625 nM to 20 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinetic parameters were determined using the kinetic function of the BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare) with double reference subtraction. Kinetic parameters for each antibody, k\na \n(association rate constant), k\nd \n(dissociation rate constant) and K\nD \n(equilibrium dissociation constant) were determined.

PC3 cells were used to measure antibody-stimulated internalization of the wild-type RON receptor. HT-29 cells were used for the delta 160 RON receptor variant. Antibodies were first conjugated with R-Phycocerthrin (Prozyme cat. No. PJ31K). All cells were washed with PBS and treated with CytoQ Antibody diluent and FC receptor block (Innovex). Cells were incubated with the antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 2 hours at 37° C. or at 4° C. The cells were transferred to 4° C., washed with an acidic solution (0.5 M NaCl, 0.18 M Acetic Acid, 0.5% Na azide) to strip off the antibody remaining on the cell surface, and fixed using BD cytofix/cytoperm Plus kit (BD Biosciences, cat. No. 555028) to measure antibodies retained intracellularly due to internalization. At 37° C., cells can undergo antibody-mediated receptor internalization, and the process is inhibited at low temperature of 4° C., thus serving as a baseline (no internalization). The cells were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC 500 FACS instrument. A lowered anti-RON median fluorescent intensity (MFI) and a left shift of the histograms at 4° C. compared to that obtained at 37° C. indicate antibody-induced receptor internalization. Receptor internalization was quantified by subtracting MFI at 4° C. from that at 37° C.

HPAF-II pancreatic cancer cells (ATCC) were incubated overnight under low serum conditions (1% FBS, MEM). Cells were trypsinized, counted, and placed at a concentration of 50,000/well in 45 μl of 1% FBS/MEM in the upper chamber of a BD 96-well FluoroBlok™ plate (Becton Dickinson). Antibodies were added at a concentration of 2 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 2 hours. The bottom chamber contained 1% FBS MEM (200 μl) and 1 nM MSP, and cells were incubated for 24 hours. The number of migrated cells was determined by the addition of Calcien Dye at 4 μg/ml final concentration to the bottom chamber, followed by a one-hour incubation. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Wallace 1420 instrument (Perkin Elmer). Baseline fluorescent measurements were done in the absence of MSP. Percent inhibition was determined by comparing antibody-treated and antibody-untreated samples to the baseline using the following formula: 100-(anti-RON antibody treated-baseline)/(control huIgG treated-baseline)*100. Results on inhibition of MSP-induced HPAFII cell migration by antibodies 07F01, 18H09, 29B06, 12B11, and 17F06 are summarized in Table 12 and \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody (2 μg/ml)\n\n\nPercent Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n07F01\n\n\n95.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29B06\n\n\n96.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17F06\n\n\n70.74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18H09\n\n\n106.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12B11\n\n\n98.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results in Table 12 demonstrate that antibodies 07F01, 18H09, 29B06, 12B11 and 17F06 inhibit MSP-dependent cell migration in HPAF-II pancreatic cancer cell lines, even though 12B11 and 17F06 do not effectively block MSP binding to RON.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nInhibition of Growth of Wild-Type RON-Dependent Tumor Model\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of tumor growth was tested in a directed complementation model of wild-type RON-driven tumor growth. “Directed complementation” tumors were obtained as described in Robinson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,556,796. A cDNA encoding wild-type human RON was introduced into BH3 tumor cells by retroviral transfer. Transfected tumor cells were then implanted subcutaneously into recipient mice. Growth of the BH3 tumors was dependent on expression of an inducible HER2 gene, which was not induced. Therefore, tumors would grow only if the RON gene functionally complemented the uninduced HER2 gene. Growth of the directed complementation tumors was observed. Primary tumors were propagated in vivo to generate sufficient tumor material for drug efficacy studies. Quality control for the directed complemented tumors included RT-PCR for RON expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for protein expression. The tumors were stored as frozen archival aliquots of approximately 1.5×10\n5 \ncells/vial. These tumors were thawed, washed once, resuspended in HBS+matrigel and injected subcutaneously. Tumor measurements were taken twice weekly using vernier calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: width×width×length/2. When tumors reached approximately 150 mm\n3\n, the mice were randomized into five groups of ten mice each. Each group (ten mice each) received one of the following antibody treatments: 07F01, 29B06, 12B11, or 18H09, or murine IgG control, all at 20 mg/kg. Treatment was administered by intra-peritoneal injection, twice weekly, for two weeks. Antibodies 29B06 and 07F01 resulted in tumor growth inhibition (“TGI”) greater than 50% (p<0.001), while antibodies 18H09 and 12B11 exhibited TGI of 25% and 29%, respectively (\nFIG. 9\n). All treatments were well-tolerated with no significant loss in body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacodynamic changes in RON receptor levels after 29B06 and 07F01 treatment were evaluated. Tumors were treated with 20 mg/kg of the following antibodies: mIgG (control), 29B06 or 07F01 and tumors were harvested at 24 or 48 hours. After harvest, the tumors were lysed in standard RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts, cat. No. BP-115) containing protease inhibitors (Roche, catalog No. 04693159001) and phosphatase inhibitors I and II (Sigma, cat. Nos. P2350 and P5726). Lysates were cleared and protein concentration was measured. A Western blot for total RON was done using a polyclonal anti-RON antibody (Santa Cruz, cat. No. sc-322). The Western blot analysis showed that antibody 29B06 induced receptor degradation in vivo in RON-DC xenograft at 24 hours, and to a greater extent at 48 hours.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nInhibition of Growth of Delta 160 RON-Driven Tumor Model\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of tumor growth by the antibodies was tested in a directed complementation model of delta 160 RON-driven tumor growth. The model was obtained as described in Example 11, except that the transfected cDNA encoded human delta 160 (oncogenic) form of RON. Growth of the directed complementation tumors was observed. Primary tumors were propagated in vivo to generate sufficient tumor material for drug efficacy studies. Quality control for the directed complimented tumors included RT-PCR for RON expression and IHC for protein expression. The tumors were stored as frozen archival aliquots of approximately 1.5×10\n5 \ncells/vial. These tumors were thawed, washed once, resuspended in HBS plus matrigel, and injected subcutaneously. Tumor measurements were taken twice weekly. When tumors reached approximately 150 mm\n3\n, the mice were randomized into five groups of ten mice each. Each group (ten mice per group) received one of the following treatments: murine IgG control, 07F01, 29B06, 12B11, 17F06, and 18H09, all at 20 mg/kg. Treatment was administered by intra-peritoneal injection, twice weekly, for two weeks. Each treatment group showed similar tumor growth inhibition of greater than 60% (p<0.001) except for 18H09 (TGI 54%) as shown in \nFIG. 10\n. All treatments were well-tolerated, with no significant loss in body weight.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nInhibition of Growth of NCI-H358 Lung Xenograft Tumor Model\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of tumor growth by the 29B06 antibody was tested in an NCI-H358 lung xenograft model. The NCI-H358 cells were grown in culture at 37° C. in an atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n, using RMPI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS. Cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of 8-week old female CB.17 SCID mice with 5×10\n6 \ncells per mouse in 50% matrigel. Tumor measurements were taken twice weekly. When tumors reached approximately 150 mm\n3\n, the mice were randomized into two groups of ten mice each. Each group received one of the following treatments: murine IgG control or 29B06 at 40 mg/kg. Treatment was administered by intra-peritoneal injection three times per week, for three weeks. Antibody 29B06 treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 70% (p<0.001) (\nFIG. 11\n). Treatment was well-tolerated, with no significant loss in body weight.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nHumanization of Anti-RON Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA. Construction of Humanized and Chimeric Anti-RON Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis Example describes the humanization of two murine antibodies, designated 07F01 and 29B06, and the characterization of the resulting humanized antibodies. The humanized anti-RON antibodies were designed using the SUPERHUMANIZATION™ method (Cephalon, Inc. (Arana Therapeutics Ltd.) and Hwang, W. Y. et al. (2005) METHODS 36:35-42), the CDR grafting method with back mutations (some human framework residues were changed to murine residues) (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,530,101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; 6,180,370; 7,022,500), or the HUMAN ENGINEERING™ method (Studnicka et al., Protein Eng. 1994 June; 7(6):805-14; also see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 93/11794 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,766,886; 5,770,196; 5,821,123; and 5,869,619). With the exception of heavy chain CDR1, the Kabat CDR definitions were used for CDR grafting onto human frameworks (SUPERHUMANIZATION™ and CDR grafting with back mutations). In some cases, a combination of Kabat and Chothia definitions were used for grafting heavy CDR1. In some cases, CDR residues (Kabat or Chothia definitions) were changed to human residues to increase humanness. Models of the murine antibodies were created using the SWISS-MODEL web server (swissmodel.expasy.org). Predicted residue contacts were determined using the Contact Map Analysis web server (ligin.weizmann.ac.il/cma/), and residue surface accessibility was determined using the Accessible Molecular Surface web server (swift.cmbi.ru.nl/servers/html/accessres.html). Residues were selected for back mutation based on predicted surface accessibility, contact with CDR residues, and involvement in the interface between heavy and light chains. Additionally, a cysteine residue present in the heavy chain CDR3 of 07F01 was changed to serine to prevent potential aggregation, and in some examples, a predicted N-linked glycosylation consensus site (N-X-S/T) in 07F01 heavy CDR2 (e.g., N58, Y59, T60) was mutated (e.g., T60A) to prevent any possible glycosylation. The designed amino acid sequences were converted to codon-optimized DNA sequences and synthesized by DNA2.0, Inc. to include (in the following order): 5′ HindIII restriction site, Kozak consensus sequence, amino terminal signal sequence, humanized variable region, human IgG1 or Kappa constant region, stop codon, and a 3′ EcoRI restriction site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-RON antibody chains humanized according to the SUPERHUMANIZATION™ method, as described herein, are designated with the prefix “Sh” before the antibody chain name. The anti-RON antibody chains humanized by the CDR grafting method with back mutations, as described herein, are designated with the prefix “Hu” before the antibody chain name. The anti-RON antibody chains humanized by the HUMAN ENGINEERING™ method, as described herein, are designated with the prefix “HE” before the antibody chain name.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-RON antibody heavy chain 07F01 was humanized according to the SUPERHUMANIZATION™ method. Human germline sequence IGHV3-48*01 (also referred to herein as Hv3-48) was selected as the human heavy chain framework. In some embodiments, the human Hv3-48 heavy chain framework sequence was mutated at amino acid position 28 (e.g., D28T). Amino acid numbering is based on the Kabat numbering system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-RON antibody light chain 07F01 was humanized according to the HUMAN ENGINEERING™ method. Human germline sequence IGKV1-9*01 was selected as the human light chain framework.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-RON antibody heavy chain 29B06 was humanized by the CDR grafting method with back mutations. Human germline sequence IGHV4-59*01 (also referred to herein as Hv4-59) was selected as the human framework. The human framework was back-mutated at amino acid positions 27, 30, 39, 44, 47, 48, 67, 71, and 78 to the murine sequence when the Kabat CDR definitions were used. The back-mutated human Hv4-59 framework sequence was further mutated to comprise at least one amino acid substitution at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 27, 30, 48, 67, and 78. Amino acid substitutions in the back-mutated Hv4-59 framework sequence (e.g., amino acid substitution from a murine residue to a human residue, e.g., a human residue found in IGHV4-59) may be selected from the group consisting of D27G, T30S, M48I, I67V and Y78F. Amino acid numbering is based on the Kabat numbering system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-RON antibody light chain 29B06 was humanized according to the SUPERHUMANIZATION™ method. Human germline sequence IGKV2-28*01 was selected as the human light chain framework.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric (murine variable region and human constant region) 07F01 and 29B06 heavy (human IgG1) and light (human Kappa) chains were also constructed. The cysteine residue present in the heavy chain CDR3 of 07F01 was changed to serine to prevent potential aggregation. To generate chimeric antibodies, the murine variable regions were fused to the human constant region using overlap extension PCR, including (in the following order): 5′ HindIII restriction site, Kozak consensus sequence, amino terminal signal sequence, mouse variable region, human IgG1 or Kappa constant region, stop codon, and 3′ EcoRI restriction site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized and chimeric heavy chains were subcloned into pEE6.4 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) via HindIII and EcoRI sites using In-Fusion™ PCR cloning (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.). The humanized and chimeric Kappa light chains were subcloned into pEE14.4 (Lonza) via HindIII and EcoRI sites using In-Fusion™ PCR cloning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody chains or chimeric antibody chains were transiently transfected into 293T cells to produce antibody. Antibody was either purified or used in cell culture media supernatant for subsequent in vitro analysis. Binding of the chimeric and humanized antibodies to human RON was measured as described below. The results are summarized in Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, some humanized antibody heavy and light chain combinations were stably expressed in CHOK1 SV cells using the GS System™ (Lonza) in order to produce large quantities of purified humanized antibody. A single expression vector was constructed by combining pEE6.4 and pEE14.4 based vectors. First, pEE6.4 containing full length humanized heavy chain cDNA was digested with NotI and SalI to isolate the hCMV-MIE promoter+full length humanized heavy chain cDNA+SV40 poly A fragment. This fragment was inserted into the pEE14.4 vector already containing full length humanized light chain cDNA via NotI/SalI sites, thus creating an expression vector that simultaneously expresses heavy and light chains. The combined heavy and light chain vector was linearized and transfected into CHOK1 SV cells. Stable clones were selected in the presence of methionine sulfoximine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the possible combinations of the humanized 07F01 immunoglobulin heavy chain and immunoglobulin light chain variable regions are set forth below in Table 13.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Chain Variable Region\n\n\nHeavy Chain Variable Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHE L 07F01 Kv1-9 Light\n\n\nSh07F01 Hv3-48 Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 135)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 139)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHE L 07F01 Kv1-9 Light\n\n\nSh07F01 Hv3-48 D28T T60A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nL63V E65G Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 139)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 137)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSh07F01 Kv1-9 F1 Light\n\n\nSh07F01 Hv3-48 Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 135)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 141)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSh07F01 Kv1-9 F1 Light\n\n\nSh07F01 Hv3-48 D28T T60A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nL63V E65G Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 141)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 137)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the possible combinations of the humanized 29B06 immunoglobulin heavy chain and immunoglobulin light chain variable regions are set forth below in Table 14.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Chain Variable Region\n\n\nHeavy Chain Variable Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSh29B06 Kv2-28 Kappa Variable\n\n\nSh29B06 Hv4-59 Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 149)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 143)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSh29B06_Kv2-28 Kappa Variable\n\n\nHu29B06 Hv4-59 Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 149)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 145)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSh29B06 Kv2-28 Kappa Variable\n\n\nHu29B06 Hv4-59 D27G T30S M48I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 149)\n\n\nI67V Y78F Heavy Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 147)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid sequences encoding and the protein sequences defining variable regions of the humanized 07F01 and 29B06 antibodies are summarized below (amino terminal signal peptide sequences are not shown).

It is within ordinary skill in the art to select a signal sequence and/or a stop codon for expression of the disclosed full length IgG heavy chain and light chain sequences. It is also contemplated that the variable region sequences can be ligated to other constant region sequences to produce active full length IgG heavy and light chains.\n\n\n \n

Binding Affinities of Humanized and Chimeric Anti-RON Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities and kinetics of interaction of monoclonal antibodies produced in Example 14 against recombinant human RON SEMA and PSI domains (rhRON SEMA+PSI) (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) were measured by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore T100 (Biacore (GE Healthcare), Piscataway, N.J.) instrument.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGoat anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Catalog No. 109-005-098) was immobilized on carboxymethylated dextran CM4 sensor chips (Biacore) by amine coupling (Biacore) using a standard coupling protocol according to the vendor's instructions. The analyses were performed at 37° C. using PBS (Invitrogen) containing 0.05% surfactant P20 (Biacore) as running buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies were captured in individual flow cells at a flow rate of 60 μl/minute. Injection time was varied for each antibody to yield an R\nmax \nbetween 30 and 60 RU. Buffer or rhRON SEMA+PSI diluted in running buffer was injected sequentially over a reference surface (no antibody captured) and the active surface (antibody to be tested) for 300 seconds at 60 μl/minute. The dissociation phase was monitored for up to 1200 seconds. The surface was then regenerated with two 60 second injections of Glycine pH 2.25 (made from Glycine pH 2.0 (Biacore) and pH 2.5 (Biacore)) at 60 μl/minute. For the initial screening, only one or two concentrations of rhRON SEMA+PSI were tested, typically 10.0 and 2.5 nM (results are summarized in Table 20).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinetic parameters were determined using the kinetic function of the BIAevaluation software (Biacore) with double reference subtraction. Kinetic parameters for each antibody, k\na \n(association rate constant), k\nd \n(dissociation rate constant) and K\nD \n(equilibrium dissociation constant) were determined. Certain monoclonal antibodies were screened using cell culture media supernatant containing secreted antibody, and kinetic values of the monoclonal antibodies on rhRON SEMA+PSI at 37° C. are summarized in Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (M)\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh07F01-2\n\n\n2.0E+06\n\n\n7.3E−04\n\n\n3.8E−10\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh07F01-62\n\n\n3.9E+06\n\n\n1.4E−03\n\n\n3.6E−10\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh07F01-69\n\n\n2.3E+06\n\n\n1.2E−03\n\n\n5.6E−10\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh07F01-76\n\n\n2.3E+06\n\n\n1.3E−03\n\n\n5.7E−10\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh07F01-83\n\n\n2.6E+06\n\n\n1.4E−03\n\n\n5.4E−10\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh29B06-1\n\n\n6.7E+05\n\n\n7.6E−04\n\n\n1.1E−09\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh29B06-9\n\n\n8.7E+05\n\n\n2.2E−04\n\n\n2.6E−10\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh29B06-23\n\n\n7.8E+05\n\n\n4.8E−04\n\n\n6.4E−10\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSh29B06-25\n\n\nNo Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results in Table 20 demonstrate that the chimeric and each of the humanized antibodies, except Sh29B06-25, have fast association rates (k\na\n), very slow disassociation rates (k\nd\n) and very high affinities (K\nD\n). In particular, the antibodies have affinities ranging from about 260 pM to about 1.1 nM. No binding was observed for Sh29B06-25. Because Sh29B06-25 does not bind rhRON SEMA+PSI and Sh29B06-23 does, one or more of the back mutations present in the heavy chain of Sh29B06-23 appear to be required for binding with high affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities and kinetics of certain purified monoclonal antibodies were also determined.

The NCI-H358 cells (ATCC) were grown in culture at 37° C. in an atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n, using RMPI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS. Cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of 8-week old female CB.17 SCID mice (Taconic Labs) with 5×10\n6 \ncells per mouse in 50% matrigel (Becton Dickinson).

Each group received one of the following treatments: human IgG (huIgG) control, mu29B06, sh29B06-78, mu07F01, sh07F01-62 and RON8. Treatment was administered by intra-peritoneal injection two times per week at 10 mg/kg for seven weeks. Treatment was well-tolerated, with no significant loss in body weight. Tumor growth inhibition is expressed as percent inhibition (baseline subtracted) to the huIgG control and statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA.

Specifically, mu29B06 antibody treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 89% (P<0.01); sh29B06-78 antibody treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 89% (P<0.01); mu07F01 antibody treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 34% (P>0.05); sh07F01-62 antibody treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 39% (P>0.05); and RON8 antibody treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 38% (P>0.05). These results demonstrate that sh29B06-78 and mu29B06 inhibit tumor growth in a NCI-H358 xenograft model (P<0.01), whereas the mu07F01, sh07F01-62, and RON8 antibodies did not inhibit tumor growth in this model (P>0.05, which is not statically significant).\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nRON Receptor Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \nWestern blots were performed to determine total levels of RON receptor at the end of treatment. Four tumor samples from each of the treatment groups were weighed, lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts), 1 mM EDTA (Boston Bioproducts), 1 mM Sodium OrthoVandadate (Sigma), 1× protease inhibitor (Sigma) and 1× Phosphatase Inhibitor I and II (Sigma). The samples were homogenized using a hand-held electric homogenizer and incubated for 10 minutes on ice. Samples are spun down at 11,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4° C. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using Pierce BCA assay kit according to the manufacturers protocol. The C-20 (Santa Cruz) antibody was used to detect total RON protein. β-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technologies) was blotted as loading control. The Western blots were blocked for one hour in 5% Milk in 1×TBST (TBS-0.1% TWEEN) (Sigma), followed by primary antibody incubation over night at 4° C. in 5\n% BSA\n 1×TBST at 1:1000 for both antibodies. Western blots were washed three times with 1×TBST, incubated with anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), for one hour at room temperature. Western blots were washed three times with 1×TBST and then developed using Dura Signal (Pierce).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results in \nFIG. 19\n demonstrate RON receptor degradation in the mu29B06 and sh29B06-78 treated samples and to a lesser extent in the mu07F01 and sh07F01-62 treated samples.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to 2-aryl imidazoline derivatives useful as medicaments. The compounds act as human QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonists, and are useful as a preventive or remedy for obesity and other diseases.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nQRFP43, a peptide of 43 amino acids, has been reported as an endogenous ligand of QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) through bioinformatics and reverse pharmacology (2003), and it was first isolated from rat brains in 2006 (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1). There are also reports that, for example, 26RFa, a close relative of QRFP43, binds to QRFP43 receptor, and has activity similar to that of QRFP43 (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 and 2). QRFP43 is expressed at high level in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, and has a diversity of functions in the body. Specifically, QRFP43 acts as a centrally-acting appetite promoter, and promotes prominent fat accumulation through secretion of various hormones or actions of the nervous system. It is known that intracerebroventricular successive administration of QRFP43 induces obesity and insulin resistance based on these actions. QRFP43 is also involved in hormone secretion such as in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functions of QRFP43 or 26RFa are expressed upon binding to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) present in the central or peripheral nervous system. It would therefore be possible to inhibit the functional expression of QRFP43 or 26RFa by inhibiting the binding of QRFP43 or 26RFa to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBis-(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-2-methylimidazole disclosed in, for example, Patent Document 3 is a compound relating to the 2-aryl imidazoline derivatives of the present invention. However, in this compound, the moiety corresponding to the Ar of the compounds of the present invention is a methyl, and the compound differs from the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-Patent Document 1: \nThe Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \nVol. 103, pp. 7438-7443, (2006)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent Document 1: WO01/16316\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent Document 2: WO05/65702\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent Document 3: U.S. Pat. No. 3,823,155A\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblems that the Invention is to Solve\n\n\n \n \n \nBecause the inhibition of the QRFP43 or 26RFa binding to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) can inhibit the functional expression of QRFP43 or 26RFa, a substance antagonistic to the QRFP43 binding to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) is expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of various diseases involving QRFP43 or 26RFa, including, for example, cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, arterial sclerosis, renal disease, heart disease, and angiospasm; bulimia; and metabolic disease such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, abnormal hormone secretion, hypercholesteremia, hyperlipidemia, gout, and fatty liver. Such a substance can therefore be provided as a preventive or remedy for, for example, pain, abnormal circadian rhythms, atherosclerosis, obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesteremia, cardiovascular disease (for example, coronary artery heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and sudden death), pain, osteoporosis-related disease, lower back pain, and anesthetic hypersensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an antagonist for QRFP43 receptor (GPR103), which is useful as a preventive or remedy for diseases such as above.\n\n\n \nMeans for Solving the Problems\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors of the present invention have found that a specific compound having a diphenylmethyl substituent at position 1 of imidazoline, and an aryl substituent at position 2 acts as a human QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonist. The present invention was completed based on this finding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the present invention provides:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) A compound represented by Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nand R\n2 \neach independently represent a hydrogen atom, halogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, haloC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, or haloC\n1-6\nalkyloxy;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3a\n, R\n3b\n, R\n4a\n, and R\n4b \neach in dependently represent a hydrogen atom, C\n1-6\nalkyl, or haloC\n1-6\nalkyl; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr represents aryl, wherein the aryl may be substituted with 1 to 3 substituents selected from a group consisting of halogen, cyano, C\n1-6\nalkyl, haloC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, haloC\n1-6\nalkyloxy, hydroxy, amino, monoC\n1-6\nalkylamino, diC\n1-6\nalkylamino, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonylamino, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonylamino, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, C\n1-6\nalkylsulfanyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyloxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) A pharmaceutical composition which contains the compound of (1) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) A preventive or remedy for obesity, which contains the compound of (1) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient.\n\n\n \nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is described below in more detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the “halogen” include fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “C\n1-6\nalkyl” includes straight-chain alkyls having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and branched alkyls having 3 to 6 carbon atoms.

A compound of Formula (I) can therefore be provided as a preventive or remedy for, for example, pain, abnormal circadian rhythms, atherosclerosis, obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesteremia, cardiovascular disease (for example, such as coronary artery heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and sudden death), pain, osteoporosis-related disease, lower back pain, and anesthetic hypersensitivity. A compound of the present invention can be orally or parenterally administered, and can be prepared into a suitable administration form and used as a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention or treatment of diseases such as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn clinical use of a compound of the present invention, the compound may generally be administered after being prepared into various dosage forms with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a manner suitable for the administration form. In this case, a variety of carriers commonly used in the field of pharmaceuticals can be used. Specific examples include gelatin, lactose, sucrose, titanium oxide, starch, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, corn starch, microcrystalline wax, white vaseline, magnesium aluminometasilicate, anhydrous calcium phosphate, citric acid, trisodium citrate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sorbitol, sorbitan fatty acid ester, polysorbate, sucrose fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene, hydrogenated castor oil, polyvinylpyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, light anhydrous silicic acid, talc, vegetable oil, benzyl alcohol, gum arabic, propylene glycol, polyalkylene glycol, cyclodextrin, and hydroxypropylcyclodextrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the dosage forms prepared with the carrier include: solid preparations such as a tablet, a capsule, a granule, a powder, and a suppository; and liquid preparations such as a syrup, an elixir, and an injection.

The drug can be simultaneously, separately, or successively administered for the prevention or treatment of the disease. When using a compound of the present invention simultaneously with one or more co-drugs, they may be prepared as a pharmaceutical composition of a single administration form. However, in combination therapy, the co-drug and a composition containing a compound of the present invention may be simultaneously, separately, or successively administered to a subject in different packages. The packages may be given with a time lag.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of the co-drug may be in accordance with that used in the clinic, and may be appropriately selected according to such factors as the subject, administration route, disease, and combination.
