For example, a polyvalent metal ion is a metal ion having a valency of at least 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Moiety” refers to the radical of a molecule that is attached to another moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe symbol \n whether utilized as a bond or displayed perpendicular to a bond, indicates the point at which the displayed moiety is attached to the remainder of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl,” by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C\n1\n-C\n10 \nmeans one to ten carbons). In some embodiments, the term “alkyl” means a straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals. Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “unsubstituted alkyl” encompasses straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals. Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified, but not limited, by —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, and further includes those groups described below as “heteroalkylene.” Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A “lower alkyl” or “lower alkylene” is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “alkoxy,” “alkylamino” and “alkylthio” (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom. In some embodiments, the term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom. In an exemplary embodiment, the heteroatoms can be selected from the group consisting of B, O, N and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) B, O, N and S may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, —S(O)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S(O)\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH═CH—O—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH═N—OCH\n3\n, and —CH═CH—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, —CH\n2\n—NH—OCH\n3\n. Similarly, the term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— and —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula —C(O)\n2\nR′— represents both —C(O)\n2\nR′— and —R′C(O)\n2\n—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkyl”, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of “alkyl” and “heteroalkyl”, respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “halo” or “halogen,” by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as “haloalkyl,” are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term “halo(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl” is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, substituent that can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings), which are fused together or linked covalently. The term “heteroaryl” refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms. In an exemplary embodiment, the heteroatom is selected from B, N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, 6-quinolyl, dioxaborolane, dioxaborinane and dioxaborepane. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor brevity, the term “aryl” when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes those radicals in which an aryl group is attached through the next moiety to the rest of the molecule. Thus, the term “arylalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, 1-(3-nitrophenyl)ethyl and the like). A substituent such as benzyl or 1-(3-nitrophenyl)ethyl can also be represented by ‘substituted alkyl’ wherein the ethyl radical is substituted with a 3-nitrophenyl moiety. The term “aryloxy” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an oxygen atom. The term “aryloxyalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an oxygen atom which is then attached to an alkyl group (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor brevity, the term “heteroaryl” when used in combination with other terms (e.g., heteroaryloxy, heteroarylthioxy, heteroarylalkyl) includes those radicals in which a heteroaryl group is attached through the next moiety to the rest of the molecule. Thus, the term “heteroarylalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which a heteroaryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., pyridylmethyl and the like). The term “heteroaryloxy” is meant to include those radicals in which a heteroaryl group is attached to an oxygen atom. The term “heteroaryloxyalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an oxygen atom which is then attached to an alkyl group. (e.g., 2-pyridyloxymethyl and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “heteroalkyl,” “aryl” and “heteroaryl”) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) are generically referred to as “alkyl group substituents,” and they can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: —R′, —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO\n2\nR′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R′″, —NR″C(O)\n2\nR′, —NR′″″—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR″″—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)\n2\nR′, —S(O)\n2\nNR′R″, —NR″SO\n2\nR′, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —N\n3\n, —CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to (2m′+1), where m′ is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF\n3 \nand —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH\n3\n, —C(O)CF\n3\n, —C(O)CH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as “aryl group substituents.” The substituents are selected from, for example: —R′, —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO\n2\nR′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R′″, —NR″C(O)\n2\nR′, —NR′″″—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR″″—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)\n2\nR′, —S(O)\n2\nNR′R″, —NR″SO\n2\nR′, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —N\n3\n, —CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)—(CRR′)\nq\n—U—, wherein T and U are independently —NR—, —O—, —CRR′— or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—B—, wherein A and B are independently —CRR′—, —O—, —NR—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)\n2\n—, —S(O)\n2\nNR′— or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula —(CRR′)\ns\n—X—(CR″R′″)\nd\n—, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X is —O—, —NR′—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)\n2\n—, or —S(O)\n2\nNR′—. The substituents R, R′, R″ and R′″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Ring” as used herein, means a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. A ring includes fused ring moieties. The number of atoms in a ring is typically defined by the number of members in the ring. For example, a “5- to 7-membered ring” means there are 5 to 7 atoms in the encircling arrangement. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally includes a heteroatom. Thus, the term “5- to 7-membered ring” includes, for example phenyl, pyridinyl and piperidinyl. The term “5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring”, on the other hand, would include pyridinyl and piperidinyl, but not phenyl. The term “ring” further includes a ring system comprising more than one “ring”, wherein each “ring” is independently defined as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroatom” includes atoms other than carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). Examples include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) sulfur (S), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), aluminum (Al) and boron (B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe symbol “R” is a general abbreviation that represents a substituent group that is selected from substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl and substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “effective” amount of a drug, formulation, or permeant is meant a sufficient amount of a active agent to provide the desired local or systemic effect. A “Topically effective,” “Cosmetically effective,” “pharmaceutically effective,” or “therapeutically effective” amount refers to the amount of drug needed to effect the desired therapeutic result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Topically effective” refers to a material that, when applied to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof produces a desired pharmacological result either locally at the place of application or systemically as a result of transdermal passage of an active ingredient in the material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cosmetically effective” refers to a material that, when applied to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, produces a desired cosmetic result locally at the place of application of an active ingredient in the material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” or “a salt thereof” are meant to include salts of the compounds of the invention which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 66: 1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compounds in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds or complexes described herein readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr, \nJ. Chem. Ed. \n1985, 62: 114-120. Solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a stereocenter unless otherwise noted. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention can exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (−)- and (+)-enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, such as enantiomerically or diastereomerically enriched mixtures, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptically active (R)- and (S)-isomers and d and/isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as an amino group, or an acidic functional group, such as a carboxyl group, diastereomeric salts can be formed with an appropriate optically active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. In addition, separation of enantiomers and diastereomers is frequently accomplished using chromatography employing chiral, stationary phases, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (e.g., formation of carbamates from amines).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to any formulation or carrier medium that provides the appropriate delivery of an effective amount of a active agent as defined herein, does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active agent, and that is sufficiently non-toxic to the host or patient. Representative carriers include water, oils, both vegetable and mineral, cream bases, lotion bases, ointment bases and the like. These bases include suspending agents, thickeners, penetration enhancers, and the like. Their formulation is well known to those in the art of cosmetics and topical pharmaceuticals. Additional information concerning carriers can be found in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005) which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier” and equivalent terms refer to pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, as described herein above, suitable for topical application. An inactive liquid or cream vehicle capable of suspending or dissolving the active agent(s), and having the properties of being nontoxic and non-inflammatory when applied to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof is an example of a pharmaceutically-acceptable topical carrier. This term is specifically intended to encompass carrier materials approved for use in topical cosmetics as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable additive” refers to preservatives, antioxidants, fragrances, emulsifiers, dyes and excipients known or used in the field of drug formulation and that do not unduly interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active agent, and that is sufficiently non-toxic to the host or patient. Additives for topical formulations are well-known in the art, and may be added to the topical composition, as long as they are pharmaceutically acceptable and not deleterious to the epithelial cells or their function. Further, they should not cause deterioration in the stability of the composition. For example, inert fillers, anti-irritants, tackifiers, excipients, fragrances, opacifiers, antioxidants, gelling agents, stabilizers, surfactant, emollients, coloring agents, preservatives, buffering agents, other permeation enhancers, and other conventional components of topical or transdermal delivery formulations as are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “enhancement,” “penetration enhancement” or “permeation enhancement” relate to an increase in the permeability of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof to a drug, so as to increase the rate at which the drug permeates through the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. The enhanced permeation effected through the use of such enhancers can be observed, for example, by measuring the rate of diffusion of the drug through animal skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof using a diffusion cell apparatus. A diffusion cell is described by Merritt et al. Diffusion Apparatus for Skin Penetration, \nJ of Controlled Release, \n1 (1984) pp. 161-162. The term “permeation enhancer” or “penetration enhancer” intends an agent or a mixture of agents, which, alone or in combination, act to increase the permeability of the skin, nail, hair or hoof to a drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “excipients” is conventionally known to mean carriers, diluents and/or vehicles used in formulating drug compositions effective for the desired use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “effective amount” or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a drug or pharmacologically active agent refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or agent to provide the desired effect. In the oral dosage forms of the present disclosure, an “effective amount” of one active of the combination is the amount of that active that is effective to provide the desired effect when used in combination with the other active of the combination. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, the particular active agent or agents, and the appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrases “active ingredient”, “therapeutic agent”, “active”, or “active agent” mean a chemical entity which can be effective in treating a targeted disorder, disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” means moieties or compounds that are, within the scope of medical judgment, suitable for use in humans without causing undesirable biological effects such as undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “oral dosage form” means any pharmaceutical composition administered to a subject via the oral cavity, in which one or more antiplatelet agents and one or more acid inhibitors are administered concurrently in combination, optionally with one or more additional drugs. Exemplary oral dosage forms include tablets, capsules, films, powders, sachets, granules, solutions, solids, suspensions or as more than one distinct unit (e.g., granules, tablets, and/or capsules containing different actives) packaged together for co-administration, and other formulations known in the art. An oral dosage form can be one, two, three, four, five or six units. When the oral dosage form has multiple units, all of the units are contained within a single package, (e.g. a bottle or other form of packaging such as a blister pack). When the oral dosage form is a single unit, it may or may not be in a single package. In a preferred embodiment, the oral dosage form is one, two or three units. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the oral dosage form is one unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “unit”, as used herein, refers to the number of discrete objects to be administered which comprise the dosage form. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention in one capsule. This is a single unit. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention as part of a therapeutically effective dosage of a cream or ointment. This is also a single unit. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention and another active ingredient contained within one capsule, or as part of a therapeutically effective dosage of a cream or ointment or lotion. This is a single unit, whether or not the interior of the capsule includes multiple discrete granules of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention in one capsule, and the active ingredient in a second capsule. This is a two unit dosage form, such as two capsules or tablets, and so such units are contained in a single package. Thus the term ‘unit’ refers to the object which is administered to the animal, not to the interior components of the object.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “prodrug”, as defined herein, is a biologically inactive derivative of a parent drug molecule that exerts its pharmacological effect only after chemical and/or enzymatic conversion to its active form in vivo. Prodrugs include those designed to circumvent problems associated with delivery of the parent drug. This may be due to poor physicochemical properties, such as poor chemical stability or low aqueous solubility, and may also be due to poor pharmacokinetic properties, such as poor bioavailability or poor half-life. Thus, certain advantages of prodrugs may include improved chemical stability, absorption, and/or PK properties of the parent carboxylic acids. Prodrugs may also be used to make drugs more “patient friendly,” by minimizing the frequency (e.g., once daily) or route of dosing (e.g., oral), or to improve the taste or odor if given orally, or to minimize pain if given parenterally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the prodrugs effect a “slow-release” of the active drug, thereby changing the time-course of D-serine increase in a manner that improves the efficacy of the parent compound. For example, compounds of the invention that extend D-serine level increases demonstrate improved efficacy in animal models of cognition (e.g., Contextual Fear Conditioning or Novel Object Recognition).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the prodrugs are chemically more stable than the active drug, thereby improving formulation and delivery of the parent drug, compared to the drug alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs for carboxylic acid analogs of the invention may include a variety of esters. In an exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include a carboxylic acid ester. In an exemplary embodiment, the prodrug is suitable for treatment/prevention of those diseases and conditions that require the drug molecule to cross the blood brain barrier. In an exemplary embodiment, the prodrug enters the brain, where it is converted into the active form of the drug molecule. In one embodiment, a prodrug is used to enable an active drug molecule to reach the inside of the eye after topical application of the prodrug to the eye. Additionally, a prodrug can be converted to its parent compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, a prodrug can be slowly converted to its parent compound when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substrates” means pharmaceutically acceptable particulate materials such as beads, particles, granules, pellets, and the like, in an oral dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “substantially free”, as used herein, refers to a composition which contains none of the substance or less than a therapeutically effective amount of the substance for any known purpose for which the composition is intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “topical administration” refers to the application of a pharmaceutical agent to the external surface of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, such that the agent crosses the external surface of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof and enters the underlying tissues. Topical administration includes application of the composition to intact skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, or to an broken, raw or open wound of skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. Topical administration of a pharmaceutical agent can result in a limited distribution of the agent to the skin and surrounding tissues or, when the agent is removed from the treatment area by the bloodstream, can result in systemic distribution of the agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transdermal delivery” refers to the diffusion of an agent across the barrier of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof resulting from topical administration or other application of a composition. The stratum corneum acts as a barrier and few pharmaceutical agents are able to penetrate intact skin. In contrast, the epidermis and dermis are permeable to many solutes and absorption of drugs therefore occurs more readily through skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof that is abraded or otherwise stripped of the stratum corneum to expose the epidermis. Transdermal delivery includes injection or other delivery through any portion of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof or mucous membrane and absorption or permeation through the remaining portion. Absorption through intact skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof can be enhanced by placing the active agent in an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle before application to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. Passive topical administration may consist of applying the active agent directly to the treatment site in combination with emollients or penetration enhancers. As used herein, transdermal delivery is intended to include delivery by permeation through or past the integument, i.e. skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substrates” means pharmaceutically acceptable particulate materials such as beads, particles, granules, pellets, and the like, in an oral dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “substantially free”, as used herein, refers to a composition which contains none of the substance or less than a therapeutically effective amount of the substance for any known purpose for which the composition is intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “microbial infection” refers to any infection of a host tissue by an infectious agent including, but not limited to, viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, fungus and parasites (see, e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, pp. 93-98 (Wilson et al., eds., 12th ed. 1991); Williams et al., \nJ. of Medicinal Chem. \n42:1481-1485 (1999), herein each incorporated by reference in their entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Biological medium,” as used herein refers to both in vitro and in vivo biological milieus. Exemplary in vitro “biological media” include, but are not limited to, cell culture, tissue culture, homogenates, plasma and blood. In vivo applications are generally performed in mammals, preferably humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “human nail unit”, as defined herein, can be the nail plate, the nail bed, proximal nail fold, lateral nail fold and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “leaving group” means a functional group or atom which can be displaced by another functional group or atom in a substitution reaction, such as a nucleophilic substitution reaction. By way of example, representative leaving groups include triflate, chloro, bromo and iodo groups; sulfonic ester groups, such as mesylate, tosylate, brosylate, nosylate and the like; and acyloxy groups, such as acetoxy, trifluoroacetoxy and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “amino-protecting group” means a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at an amino nitrogen. Representative amino-protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl; acyl groups, for example alkanoyl groups, such as acetyl, trichloroacetyl or trifluoroacetyl; alkoxycarbonyl groups, such as tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc); arylmethoxycarbonyl groups, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc); arylmethyl groups, such as benzyl (Bn), trityl (Tr), and 1,1-di-(4′-methoxyphenyl)methyl; silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl (TMS) and tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS); and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hydroxy-protecting group” means a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a hydroxy group. Representative hydroxy-protecting groups include, but are not limited to, alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, and tert-butyl; acyl groups, for example alkanoyl groups, such as acetyl; arylmethyl groups, such as benzyl (Bn), p-methoxybenzyl (PMB), 9-fluorenylmethyl (Fm), and diphenylmethyl (benzhydryl, DPM); silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl (TMS) and tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS); and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso of use in the present invention are compounds that are poly- or multi-valent species, including, for example, species such as dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher homologs of the compounds of use in the invention or reactive analogues thereof. The poly- and multi-valent species can be assembled from a single species or more than one species of the invention. For example, a dimeric construct can be “homo-dimeric” or “heterodimeric.” Moreover, poly- and multi-valent constructs in which a compound of the invention or a reactive analogue thereof, is attached to an oligomeric or polymeric framework (e.g., polylysine, dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and the like) are within the scope of the present invention. The framework is preferably polyfunctional (i.e. having an array of reactive sites for attaching compounds of use in the invention). Moreover, the framework can be derivatized with a single species of the invention or more than one species of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the present invention includes the use of compounds within the motif set forth in the formulae contained herein, which are functionalized to afford compounds having water-solubility that is enhanced relative to analogous compounds that are not similarly functionalized. Thus, any of the substituents set forth herein can be replaced with analogous radicals that have enhanced water solubility. For example, it is within the scope of the invention to replace a hydroxyl group with a diol, or an amine with a quaternary amine, hydroxy amine or similar more water-soluble moiety. In a preferred embodiment, additional water solubility is imparted by substitution at a site not essential for the activity towards the editing domain of the compounds set forth herein with a moiety that enhances the water solubility of the parent compounds. Methods of enhancing the water-solubility of organic compounds are known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, functionalizing an organic nucleus with a permanently charged moiety, e.g., quaternary ammonium, or a group that is charged at a physiologically relevant pH, e.g. carboxylic acid, amine. Other methods include, appending to the organic nucleus hydroxyl- or amine-containing groups, e.g. alcohols, polyols, polyethers, and the like. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, polylysine, polyethyleneimine, poly(ethyleneglycol) and poly(propyleneglycol). Suitable functionalization chemistries and strategies for these compounds are known in the art. See, for example, Dunn, R. L., et al., Eds. POLYMERIC DRUGS AND DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS, ACS Symposium Series Vol. 469, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. 1991.\n\n\n \nII.

Those skilled in the art will recognize a wide variety of non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable solvents that may be used to prepare solvates of the compounds of the invention, such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, mineral oil, vegetable oil and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be administered orally, topically, ocularly, intraperitoneally, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or rectally in unit dosage forms containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. It is further understood that the best method of administration may be a combination of methods. Oral administration in the form of a pill, capsule, elixir, syrup, lozenge, troche, or the like is particularly preferred. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intradermal, intravascular (e.g., intravenous), intramuscular, spinal, intrathecal injection or like injection or infusion techniques.

Tablets may contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; and extenders and bulking agents, such as microcrystalline cellulose. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; and dispersing or wetting agents, which may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Other dispersing agents include hydrophilic polymers, electrolytes, Tween™ 60 or 80, PEG, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; commercially known as Plasdone™), and the carbohydrate-based dispersing agents such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose ethers (e.g., HPC, HPC-SL, and HPC-L), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ethers (e.g. HPMC K100, HPMC K4M, HPMC K15M, and HPMC K100M), carboxymethylcellulose sodium, methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate stearate, noncrystalline cellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, triethanolamine, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer (Plasdone™, e.g., S-630), 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenol polymer with ethylene oxide and formaldehyde (also known as tyloxapol), poloxamers (e.g., Pluronics F68™, F88™, and F108™, which are block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide); and poloxamines (e.g., Tetronic 9080, also known as Poloxamine 9080, which is a tetrafunctional block copolymer derived from sequential addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to ethylenediamine (BASF Corporation, Parsippany, N.J.)). Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions and water-in-oil emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth; naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol; anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical formulations may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations may also be administered in the form of suppositories, e.g., for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the pharmaceutical formulations can be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations may be administered ocularly. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic formulation contains a liquid vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Such ophthalmic formulations can then be administered to the eye in the form of a droplet. Suitable vehicles, and optional tear substitute components, are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration to non-human animals, the composition containing the therapeutic compound may be added to the animal's feed or drinking water. Also, it will be convenient to formulate animal feed and drinking water products so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the compound in its diet. It will further be convenient to present the compound in a composition as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water. The composition can also added as a food or drink supplement for humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of the order of from about 5 mg to about 250 mg per kilogram of body weight per day and more preferably from about 25 mg to about 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a unit dosage form will vary depending upon the condition being treated and the particular mode of administration. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrequency of dosage may also vary depending on the compound used and the particular disease treated. However, for treatment of most disorders, a dosage regimen of 4 times daily or less is preferred. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the unit dosage form contains from about 1 mg to about 800 mg of a compound of the invention.

Penetration of the blood brain barrier for compounds used to treat CNS disorders is necessary, while low brain levels of compounds used to treat peripheral disorders are often preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Toxicity to cultured hepatocytes may be used to predict compound toxicity. Penetration of the blood brain barrier of a compound in humans may be predicted from the brain levels of laboratory animals that receive the compound intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcova, et al. (Journal of Chromatography B (1996) volume 677, pages 1-27).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound half-life is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of a compound. In vitro half-lives of compounds may be predicted from assays of microsomal half-life as described by Kuhnz and Gieschen (Drug Metabolism and Disposition, (1998) volume 26, pages 1120-1127).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the composition required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular compound selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition described herein includes an additional active ingredient. In another exemplary embodiment, the additional active ingredient is an immunosuppressive agent. In still another exemplary embodiment, the additional active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, azathioprine (6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate and cyclosporine, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, alefacept, efalizumab and anakinra\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the additional active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of cilostazol, rolipram, apremilast, roflumilast, piclamilast, CDP-840 and cilomilast.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another exemplary embodiment, the additional active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of betamethasone, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. In still another exemplary embodiment, the additional active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of an activated vitamin D analog and an arotinoid (an aromatic retinoic acid analog). In still another exemplary embodiment, the additional active ingredient is a carcipotriol, such as Tazorac (tazarotene).\n\n\n \nV. a) Topical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention can be employed through the topical application of the compounds described herein. Topical administration includes for example, transmucosal, transdermal, ungual and transungual routes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention comprises fluid or semi-solid vehicles that may include but are not limited to polymers, thickeners, buffers, neutralizers, chelating agents, preservatives, surfactants or emulsifiers, antioxidants, waxes or oils, emollients, sunscreens, and a solvent or mixed solvent system. The solvent or mixed solvent system is important to the formation because it is primarily responsible for dissolving the drug. The best solvent or mixed solvent systems are also capable of maintaining clinically relevant levels of the drug in solution despite the addition of a poor solvent to the formulation. The topical compositions useful in the subject invention can be made into a wide variety of product types. These include, but are not limited to, lotions, creams, gels, sticks, sprays, ointments, pastes, foams, mousses, masks, eye ointments, eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings, wipes, cleansers including soaps, body washes and shampoos, and make-up products, such as bases, blushes, lipsticks, and eye shadows, among others. These product types can comprise several types of carrier systems including, but not limited to particles, nanoparticles, and liposomes. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Techniques for formulation and administration can be found in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, supra. The formulation can be selected to maximize delivery to a desired target site in the body. The formulations can also include various conventional colorants, fragrances, thickeners, preservatives, humectants, emollients, demulcents, solubilizing excipients, dispersants, penetration enhancers, plasticizing agents, preservatives, stabilizers, demulsifiers, wetting agents, sunscreens, emulsifiers, moisturizers, astringents, deodorants, and the like, which can be added to provide additional benefits such as, for example, improving the feel and/or appearance of the topical preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLotions, which are preparations that are to be applied to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof surface without friction, are typically liquid or semi-liquid preparations in which finely divided solid, waxy, or liquid are dispersed. Lotions will typically contain suspending agents to produce better dispersions as well as compounds useful for localizing and holding the active agent in contact with the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, e.g., methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCreams containing the active agent for delivery according to the present invention are viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions, either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are water-washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase is generally comprised of petrolatum or a fatty alcohol, such as cetyl- or stearyl alcohol; the aqueous phase usually, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation, as explained in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, supra, is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA lotion or cream may include a relatively large aqueous phase and a relatively small oil phase. Furthermore, the lotions and creams of the invention may include the active compound “all-in-solution” in the oil phase so that substantially none of the active compound crystallizes out at room temperature. In one embodiment, the lotion or cream may comprise a biphasic system, that is, a system wherein a portion (from about 30 to about 75% by weight) of the active compound is in solution in the oil phase and the remainder is in suspension in the aqueous phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGel formulations can also be used in connection with the present invention. As will be appreciated by those working in the field of topical drug formulation, gels are semisolid. Single-phase gels contain organic macromolecules distributed substantially uniformly throughout the carrier liquid, which is typically aqueous, but also may be a solvent or solvent blend. In various embodiments, conventional gelling agents can be used. In an exemplary embodiment, cellulose or its derivatives are used. In an exemplary embodiment, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, such as Methocel E4M, is used. Other gelling agents include methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, ethyl cellulose, methyl hydroxy ethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, and cellulose gum. Cellulose based gelling agents, particularly hydroxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, are also useful in some embodiments. In some embodiments, cross-linked acrylic polymers including Carbopol may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the formulation of the invention is viscous enough to form a firm gel. In one embodiment, the viscosity is in the range of 25,000-300,000 cps (centipoise) or 75,000-200,000 cps, based on Brookfield (LV) analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ease of preparation, it may be convenient to prepare a first gel composition, named speed-gel herein, which can be used to add to other components in the formulation of a final composition for topical administration. There are several possible formulations of the speed-gel. For example, a speed-gel may be prepared by mixing lecithin organogel (L.O.), as a 1:1 (m/m) mixture of lecithin and isopropyl myristate, with LID oil (a 1:1 [m/m] mixture of L.O. and docusate sodium), dissolving additional docusate sodium powder into this mixture, and then adding aqueous urea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOintments, which are semisolid preparations, are typically based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. As will be appreciated by the ordinarily skilled artisan, the specific ointment base to be used is one that provides for optimum delivery for the active agent chosen for a given formulation, and, preferably, provides for other desired characteristics as well, e.g., emolliency or the like. As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirritating and non-sensitizing. As explained in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Ed. (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Co., 1995), at pages 1399-1404, ointment bases may be grouped in four classes: oleaginous bases; emulsifiable bases; emulsion bases; and water-soluble bases. Oleaginous ointment bases include, for example, vegetable oils, fats obtained from animals, and semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. Examples of oleaginous ointment bases include White Ointment USP, Yellow Ointment NF, Oleic Acid USP, Olive Oil USP, Paraffin USP, Petrolatum NF, White Petrolatum USP, Spermaceti Wax USP, Synthetic Spermaceti NF, Starch Glycerite NF, White Wax USP, and Yellow Wax USP. Emulsifiable ointment bases, also known as absorbent ointment bases, contain little or no water and include, for example, hydroxystearin sulfate, anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Emulsion ointment bases are either water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, and include, for example, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, lanolin and stearic acid. Preferred water-soluble ointment bases are prepared from polyethylene glycols of varying molecular weight; again, reference may be had to Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra, for further information.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful formulations of the invention also encompass sprays and aerosols. Sprays generally provide the active agent in an aqueous and/or alcoholic solution which can be misted onto the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof for delivery. Such sprays include those formulated to provide for concentration of the active agent solution at the site of administration following delivery, e.g., the spray solution can be primarily composed of alcohol or other like volatile liquid in which the drug or active agent can be dissolved. Upon delivery to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, the carrier evaporates, leaving concentrated active agent at the site of administration. Examples of aerosol technology are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,682,716; 6,716,415; 6,716,417; 6,783,753; 7,029,658; and 7,033,575.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers. Examples of such carriers include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise a suitable emulsifier which refers to an agent that enhances or facilitates mixing and suspending oil-in-water or water-in-oil. The emulsifying agent used herein may consist of a single emulsifying agent or may be a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant or blend of two or more such surfactants; preferred for use herein are nonionic or anionic emulsifiers.

For simplicity, typical counterions are provided above. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, however, that any bioacceptable counterion may be used. For example, although the fatty acids are shown as sodium salts, other cation counterions can also be used, such as, for example, alkali metal cations or ammonium. Formulations of the invention may include one or more of the ionic surfactants above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred for use herein are high molecular weight alcohols such as cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, emulsifying wax, glyceryl monostearate, and oleyl alcohol.

Emollients are materials used for the prevention or relief of dryness, as well as for the protection of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. Useful emollients include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon oils, waxes, silicone, cetyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, stearyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, octyl hydroxystearate, glycerin, other fatty alcohols including short or medium chain fatty alcohols having a carbon length of up to 18, medium or short chain fatty acid triglycerides, esters such as fatty acid esters, lecithins and related polar compounds such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin and the like.

Preferably the preservative is a mixture of methylparaben and proplybarben in a 5/1 ratio. When alcohol is used as a preservative, the amount is usually 15 to 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable chelating agents to form complexes with metal cations that do not cross a lipid bilayer. Examples of suitable chelating agents include ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 8-Amino-2-[(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)methyl]-6-methoxyquinoline-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetrapotassium salt (QUIN-2). Preferably the chelating agents are EDTA and citric acid. A chelating agent may comprise salts of the above, such as edetate disodium, for example.

The neutralizing agent is generally added in whatever amount is required to bring the formulation to the desired pH. In one embodiment, the pH is about 6.0 to about 8.0. In one embodiment, the pH is about 3.0 to about 4.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable thickening or viscosity increasing agents. These components are diffusible compounds capable of increasing the viscosity of a polymer-containing solution through the interaction of the agent with the polymer. For example, CARBOPOL ULTREZ 10, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and fumed silica may be used as a viscosity-increasing agent. These materials are available from Noveon Chemicals, Cleveland, Ohio. Other examples of thickeners include monoglycerides and fatty alcohols, fatty acid esters of alcohols having from about 3 to about 16 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable monoglycerides are glyceryl monostearate and glyceryl monopalmitate. Examples of fatty alcohols are cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. Examples of suitable esters are myristyl stearate and cetyl stearate. The monoglyceride also functions as an auxilliary emulsifier. Other emollients or oleaginous material which may be employed include petrolatum, glyceryl monooleate, myristyl alcohol, and isopropyl palmitate. In one embodiment, the thickener is used in combination with an emulsifying agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the topical formulations of the present invention contain at least one viscosity increasing agent, the total amount of viscosity increasing agent present is from about 0.25% to about 5.0% by weight, preferably from about 0.25% to about 1.0 wt %, and more preferably from about 0.4% to about 0.6% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise a disintegrating agent including starch, e.g., a natural starch such as corn starch or potato starch, a pregelatinized starch such as National 1551 or Amijele™, or sodium starch glycolate such as Promogel™ or Explotab™; a cellulose such as a wood product, microcrystalline cellulose, e.g., Avicel™, Avicel™ PH101, Avicel™ PH102, Avicel™ PH105, Elcema™ P100, Emcocel™, Vivacel™, Ming Tia™, and Solka-Floc™, methylcellulose, croscarmellose, or a cross-linked cellulose, such as cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Ac-Di-Sol™), cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose, or cross-linked croscarmellose; a cross-linked starch such as sodium starch glycolate; a cross-linked polymer such as crosspovidone; a cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone; alginate such as alginic acid or a salt of alginic acid such as sodium alginate; a clay such as Veegum™ HV (magnesium aluminum silicate); a gum such as agar, guar, locust bean, Karaya, pectin, or tragacanth; sodium starch glycolate; bentonite; a natural sponge; a surfactant; a resin such as a cation-exchange resin; citrus pulp; sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium lauryl sulfate in combination starch; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable nail penetration enhancers. Examples of nail penetration enhancers include mercaptan compounds, sulfites and bisulfites, keratolytic agents and surfactants. Nail penetration enhancers suitable for use in the invention are described in greater detail in Malhotra et al., \nJ. Pharm. Sci., \n91:2, 312-323 (2002), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise an anti-foaming anti-whitening agent that increases the elegancy of the cream or lotion and inhibits the formation of a white soapy look upon rubbing the cream or lotion on the skin. An example of such material includes silicone fluid. Other anti-foaming agents include simethicone, polyglycol, and sorbitan sesquioleate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise a post-foaming agent. “Post-foaming” refers to a gel that remains a gel as it is expelled from a container but foams up after it is spread over the skin. Post-foaming agents include saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons having from 4-6 carbon atoms, such as butane, pentane and hexane (in particular is opentane and isobutene). Other suitable post-foaming agents include partially, or wholly halogenated hydrocarbons, such as trichlorofluoroethane. Also, mixtures of aliphatic and halogenated hydrocarbon propellants, or post-foaming agents can be used. Generally suitable post-foaming agents are those substances that have a low solubility in water, for example less than about 20 cc of gas in 100 grams of water at one atmosphere and 20° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe topical pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise one or more suitable solvents. The ability of any solid substance (solute) to dissolve in any liquid substance (solvent) is dependent upon the physical properties of the solute and the solvent. When solutes and solvents have similar physical properties the solubility of the solute in the solvent will be the greatest. This gives rise to the traditional understanding that “like dissolves like.” Solvents can be characterized in one extreme as non-polar, lipophilic oils, while in the other extreme as polar hydrophilic solvents. Oily solvents dissolve other non-polar substances by Van der Wals interactions while water and other hydrophilic solvents dissolve polar substances by ionic, dipole, or hydrogen bonding interactions. All solvents can be listed along a continuum from the least polar, i.e. hydrocarbons such as decane, to the most polar solvent being water. A solute will have its greatest solubility in solvents having equivalent polarity. Thus, for drugs having minimal solubility in water, less polar solvents will provide improved solubility with the solvent having polarity nearly equivalent to the solute providing maximum solubility. Most drugs have intermediate polarity, and thus experience maximum solubility in solvents such as propylene glycol or ethanol, which are significantly less polar than water. If the drug has greater solubility in propylene glycol (for example 8% (w/w)) than in water (for example 0.1% (w/w)), then addition of water to propylene glycol should decrease the maximum amount of drug solubility for the solvent mixture compared with pure propylene glycol. Addition of a poor solvent to an excellent solvent will decrease the maximum solubility for the blend compared with the maximum solubility in the excellent solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen compounds are incorporated into topical formulations the concentration of active ingredient in the formulation may be limited by the solubility of the active ingredient in the chosen solvent and/or carrier. Non-lipophilic drugs typically display very low solubility in pharmaceutically acceptable solvents and/or carriers. For example, the solubility of some compounds in the invention in water is less than 0.00025% wt/wt. The solubility of the same compounds in the invention can be less than about 2% wt/wt in either propylene glycol or isopropyl myristate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of solubilizing excipients include polyethoxylated fatty acids, PEG-fatty acid diesters, PEG-fatty acid mono-ester and di-ester mixtures, polyethylene glycol glycerol fatty acid esters, alcohol-oil transesterification products, polyglycerized fatty acids, propylene glycol fatty acid esters, mixtures of propylene glycol esters-glycerol esters, mono- and diglycerides, sterol and sterol derivatives, polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers, sugar esters, polyethylene glycol alkyl phenols, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, lower alcohol fatty acid esters, ionic surfactants, tocopherol esters, and sterol esters. In one embodiment of the present invention, ethylhexyl hydroxystearate is the solvent used to dissolve the compounds described herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME) is the solvent used to dissolve the compounds described herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME) is the solvent used to dissolve a compound of the invention. The compounds in the invention useful in the present formulation are believed to have a solubility of from about 10% wt/wt to about 25% wt/wt in DGME. In another embodiment a DGME water cosolvent system is used to dissolve the compounds described herein. In another embodiment a DGME water cosolvent system is used to dissolve a compound of the invention. The solvent capacity of DGME drops when water is added; however, the DGME/water cosolvent system can be designed to maintain the desired concentration of from about 0.1% to about 5% wt/wt active ingredient. Preferably the active ingredient is present from about 0.5% to about 3% wt/wt, and more preferably at about 1% wt/wt, in the as-applied topical formulations. Because DGME is less volatile than water, as the topical formulation evaporates upon application, the active agent becomes more soluble in the cream formulation. This increased solubility reduces the likelihood of reduced bioavailability caused by the drug precipitating on the surface of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the vehicle is lipophilic. Lipophilic materials include oleaginous material such as petrolatum, mineral oil thickened or gelled with polyethylene, high molecular weight paraffin waxes, mono and diglycerides of fatty acids gelled with high molecular weight fatty acids or polyamide complex of hydroxystearate, propylene glycol isostearate or isostearyl alcohol gelled with high molecular weight fatty acids, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid forms, such as lotions suitable for topical administration or suitable for cosmetic application, may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, thickeners, penetration enhancers, and the like. Solid forms such as creams or pastes or the like may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, water, oil, alcohol or grease as a substrate with surfactant, polymers such as polyethylene glycol, thickeners, solids and the like. Liquid or solid formulations may include enhanced delivery technologies such as liposomes, microsomes, microsponges and the like. Liposomal formulations, which help allow compounds to enter the skin, are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,169,637; 5,000,958; 5,049,388; 4,975,282; 5,194,266; 5,023,087; 5,688,525; 5,874,104; 5,409,704; 5,552,155; 5,356,633; 5,032,582; 4,994,213; and PCT Publication No. WO 96/40061.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compounds can be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Thus, at least two different dosage forms, each of which contains a compound of the inventon, may be formulated for topical administration by including such dosage forms in an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil emulsion. In such a formulation, the delayed release dosage forms are in the continuous phase, and the delayed sustained release dosage form is in a discontinuous phase. The formulation may also be produced in a manner for delivery of three dosage forms as hereinabove described. For example, there may be provided an oil-in-water-in-oil emulsion, with oil being a continuous phase that contains the third delayed sustained release component, water dispersed in the oil containing a first delayed release dosage form, and oil dispersed in the water containing a second delayed release dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopical treatment regimens according to the practice of this invention comprise applying the composition directly to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof at the application site, from one to several times daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention can be used to treat, ameliorate or prevent conditions or symptoms associated with bacterial infections, acne, inflammation and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation includes a simple solution.

The following agents are known compounds and are readily available commercially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-inflammatory agents include, but are not limited to, bisabolol, mentholatum, dapsone, aloe, hydrocortisone, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVitamins include, but are not limited to, Vitamin B, Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, and the like and vitamin derivatives such as tazarotene, calcipotriene, tretinoin, adapalene and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-aging agents include, but are not limited to, niacinamide, retinol and retinoid derivatives, AHA, Ascorbic acid, lipoic acid, coenzyme Q 10, beta hydroxy acids, salicylic acid, copper binding peptides, dimethylaminoethyl (DAEA), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSunscreens and or sunburn relief agents include, but are not limited to, PABA, jojoba, aloe, padimate-O, methoxycinnamates, proxamine HCl, lidocaine and the like. Sunless tanning agents include, but are not limited to, dihydroxyacetone (DHA). Ultraviolet (UV) light blockers include, for example, amino benzoic acids, benzophenones, camphors, cinnamates, dibenzoyl methanes, salicylates, metal oxides, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsoriasis-treating agents and/or acne-treating agents include, but are not limited to, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, coal tar, selenium sulfide, zinc oxide, pyrithione (zinc and/or sodium), tazarotene, calcipotriene, tretinoin, adapalene and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents that are effective to control or modify keratinization, including without limitation: tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions comprising an compound/active agent described herein, and optionally at least one of these additional agents, are to be administered topically. In a primary application, this leads to the compounds of the invention and any other active agent working upon and treating the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. Alternatively, any one of the topically applied active agents may also be delivered systemically by transdermal routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn such compositions an additional cosmetically or pharmaceutically effective agent, such as an anti-inflammatory agent, vitamin, anti-aging agent, sunscreen, and/or acne-treating agent, for example, is usually a minor component (from about 0.001% to about 20% by weight or preferably from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.\n\n\n \nV. c) Testing\n\n\n \n \n \nPreferred compounds for use in the pharmaceutical formulations described herein will have certain pharmacological properties. Such properties include, but are not limited to, low toxicity, low serum protein binding and desirable in vitro and in vivo half-lives. Assays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Serum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcova et al. (1996, \nJ. Chromat\n. B677: 1-27). Compound half-life is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of a compound. In vitro half-lives of compounds may be predicted from assays of microsomal half-life as described by Kuhnz and Gleschen (Drug Metabolism and Disposition, (1998) volume 26, pages 1120-1127).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the unit dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See, e.g. Fingl et al., 1975, in “The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics”, Ch. 1, p. 1).\n\n\n \nV. d) Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nFor any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays, as disclosed herein. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC\n50 \n(Inhibitory dose causing a 50% decrease) as determined in cell culture, i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of helminth growth or survival or inhibition of an enzyme involved in inflammation. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the compounds prepared by the methods, and from the intermediates, described herein will be administered in a therapeutically or cosmetically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of absorption, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The drug can be administered from once or twice a day, or up to 3 or 4 times a day or, if required, by continuous infusion over a number of days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety that are sufficient to maintain helminth survival inhibition effects. In an exemplary embodiment, usual patient dosages for systemic administration range from 0.1 to 1000 mg/day, preferably, 1-500 mg/day, more preferably 10-200 mg/day, even more preferably 100-200 mg/day. Stated in terms of patient body surface areas, usual dosages can range from 50-91 mg/m\n2\n/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt %) basis, from about 0.01-100 wt % of the drug based on the total formulation, with the balance, if required, being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 0.1-3.0 wt %, more preferably, about 1.0 wt %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation is an ointment, and

C.; Kahn, M.; and Mitra, M. \nJournal of Organic Chemistry, \n1978, 43, 2923-2925. Typical solvents used for flash chromatography or thin layer chromatography were mixtures of chloroform/methanol, dichloromethane/methanol, ethyl acetate/methanol petroleum ether/ethyl acetate and hexanes/ethyl acetate.\n\n\n \nIntermediate 1: Benzo[c][1,2]oxaborole-1,5(3H)-diol\n\n\n \n \n \nInto a 250-mL 3-necked round-bottom flask purged and maintained with an inert atmosphere of nitrogen were placed a solution of 2-bromo-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5 g, 25.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 1,4-dioxane (100 mL), 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (12.7 g, 50.0 mmol, 2.00 equiv), Pd(dppf)\n2\nCl\n2 \n(1.83 g, 2.50 mmol, 0.10 equiv) and KOAc (7.35 g, 75.0 mmol, 3.00 equiv). The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at 100° C. The reaction mixture was cooled and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column and eluted with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1/10). This resulted in 3.12 g (45%) of 5-hydroxy-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzaldehyde as a white solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInto a 100-mL 3-necked round-bottom flask purged and maintained with an inert atmosphere of nitrogen was placed a solution of 5-hydroxy-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzaldehyde (5.5 g, 22 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in methanol (25 mL). This was followed by the addition of NaBH\n4 \n(1.24 g, 32.6 mmol, 1.5 equiv) in several batches at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 10 min at 0° C., then it was concentrated under vacuum to get rid of half methanol at low temperature. To the residual solution was added water (6 mL) and HCl (6M, 14.5 mL) dropwise at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. Then it was concentrated under vacuum at low temperature to remove MeOH. The solid was collected by filtration. This resulted in 2.0 g of benzo[c][1,2]oxaborole-1,5(3H)-diol as a white solid.\n\n\n \nIntermediate 2: 6-Fluorobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborole-1,5(3H)-diol\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of 4-fluoro-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (4.3 g, 28 mmol), potassium bromide (16.6 g, 140 mmol), bromine (3.6 mL, 70 mmol), and water (45 mL) were stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. More bromine (1.4 mL, 28 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight.

The glacier acetic acid was removed under reduced pressure. The solution was neutralized using sodium carbonate. Water was added and the mixture was extracted using ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column using Combiflash to give 2-bromo-4-fluoro-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1.15 g, 64%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of 2-bromo-4-fluoro-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2.0 g, 9.1 mmol) in MeOH (15 mL) was cooled in an ice bath before treatment of NaBH\n4 \n(390 mg, 10.3 mmol). After the complete addition of NaBH\n4\n, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 1 h at room temperature before it was quenched with equal volume of water. EtOAc (20 mL) was added to the reaction solution and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was further extracted with equal volume of EtOAc before the organic layers were combined and dried over anhydrous Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column using Combiflash to give 4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (2.0 g, 83%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtection of the alcohol was carried out by making a solution of 4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (1.37 g, 6.19 mmol), 3,4 dihydro-2H-pyran (1.4 mL, 15 mmol) in 20 mL of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The reaction mixture was then treated with camphor sulfonic acid (58 mg, 0.25 mmol) before stirring at room temperature for 21 hr. The reaction mixture was then quenched with equal volumes of 0.2 M NaOH and EtOAc (1:1, 20 mL) before the layers were separated.

The PDE4 enzyme was partially purified from human U937 myeloid leukemia cells and activity was assayed using a method optimized from Cortijo et al (10, Cortijo 1993) and Nicholson et al. (11, Nicholson, 1991). Test article and/or vehicle was incubated with 0.2 mg of enzyme and 1 μM cAMP containing 0.01 μM [\n3\nH]cAMP in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n) for 20 minutes at 25° C. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 2 minutes and the resulting AMP was converted to adenosine by addition of 10 mg/ml snake venom nucleotidase and further incubation at 37° C. for 10 min. Unhydrolyzed cAMP was bound to AG1-X2 resin, and the remaining [\n3\nH] adenosine in the aqueous phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. Test articles were tested often tested at 9 concentrations using half-log dilutions series. All assays used a substrate concentration below the Km determined for each enzyme so that the Ki approximates the IC\n50\n. The IC\n50 \nvalue of 6-(1-Hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-5-yloxy)-2-(2-isopropoxyethoxy)nicotinonitrile (D140) under similar conditions is 9 nM.

Patent \nB. glabrata \nsnails (6-8 weeks after exposure to 5-10 infectious miracidia) were induced to shed infective larvae (cercariae) under light stimulus into the surrounding water. Cercariae were washed in rounds of ice-cold water and concentrated through and over sieves of varying pore sizes. They were then mechanically sheared (separation of heads from tails) as described in Colley D G, et al. \nExp Parasitol \n1974, 35:44-51, in ice-cold Incomplete Medium 169 (as described in Basch P F. \nJ Parasitol \n1981, 67:179-185, minus FBS and antibiotics) by passing 15 times through a double headed 22-gauge syringe needle connected to two 10 mL syringes. The resulting cercarial heads (schistosomula) were separated from their tails by swirling in a petri dish. Concentrated schistosomula were added to a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and allowed to settle over ice. Schistosomula were transferred to a sterile environment and washed 4 times in Incomplete Medium 169 prior to plating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo sets of screening were performed. In the first set, compounds were screened against schistosomula and observations were made at 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 6 days. In the second set, compounds were screened against schistosomula with observations at 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, and 4 days and adult worms at 7 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, and 6 days.\n\n\n \nPlating and Compound Screening of Schistosomula\n\n\n \n \n \nPlates contain 200 schistosomula/well in 200 pL complete Basch medium and were maintained at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. All compounds were tested in duplicate with at least two experimental replicates. Compounds and control compounds were added to the plates using the Biomek FXp using 96-well disposable tips. Final concentration of DMSO in each well was 0.5%.\n\n\n \nPlating and Compound Screening of Adults\n\n\n \n \n \nGiven the delicacy and size (0.5-1.5 cm in length) of this stage all operations were performed manually by the Sandler Center. 24-well plates were set up with compound (final DMSO concentration=0.5%) containing approximately 5 pairs of worms (\nS. mansoni \nhas separate sexes) in 2 mL complete Basch medium per well. Plates were maintained at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. All compounds were tested in duplicate with at least two experimental replicates.\n\n\n \nPhenotype Scoring In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nA semi-quantitative and controlled nomenclature for phenotypes that can arise as a result of compound insult to both schistosomula and adults was utilized (Abdulla M H, et al., \nPLoS Negl Trop Dis \n2009, 3:e478). Phenotypes were recorded by visual inspection and on a flexible time basis but at least at 24 h and 4 day time-points in the case of large scale screening. Visual recording of phenotypes proved both necessary and reliable in the context of thorough accounting for the multiple and changing phenotypes that were typically evident at any given time and for which death, while desired, was just one of several outcomes. To help eliminate bias, two screen analysts scored phenotypes ‘blind’ both to knowledge of the contents of each screening plate and the phenotypes scored by his/her colleague. Upon completing their individual assessments, each analyst's ‘hit sheet’ was then compared to derive a ‘consensus hit sheet’. Discrepancies in analysts' hit sheets were re-evaluated under the microscope to eventually make a consensus hit call. All phenotypes were compared to those generated by the positive control compounds, PZQ, niclosamide and rafoxanide, which caused dose-dependent, rapid and severe phenotypes in both schistosomula and adult worms.\n\n\n \n \nAdult \nSchistosoma mansoni \nPhenotypic Key:\n\n\nO=overactive; S=slow; Dark; R=round; Deg-M=worms in morphological disarray but still living; D=dead; Partial D=partial killing of worm population; Dying; Sex sep=worm pairs have separated; On Sides=male worms do not adhere to dish bottom; Partial D=Some of the worms in the well have died; Blank means no phenotype out of ordinary observed. Hyper-coiled and coiled represent a verbal description of the visual phenotype as compared to the DMSO control. The + and ++ and +++ means more of the phenotype which preceded it. The − means less of the phenotype which preceded it.\n\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nFirst Set—Tested for Schistosomula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24 h\n\n\nday

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to an indole-2-carboxamide derivative useful as medicines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound acts as a human QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonist and is useful as a preventive or remedy for obesity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nQRFP43 is a peptide comprising 43 amino acids, and in 2003, this was reported to be an endogenous ligand of a QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) through bioinformatics and reverse pharmacological analysis, and later in 2006, this was first isolated from a rat brain (for example, see Non-Patent Reference 1). It is said that a QRFP43 analogue, for example, 26RFa binds to a QRFP43 receptor and exhibits the same activity as that of QRFP43 (for example, see Patent References 1 and 2). QRFP43 is much expressed in a central nervous system, especially in hypothalamus, and controls many functions in living bodies. Specifically, QRFP43 acts as an appetite stimulant in a central system, and remarkably promotes fat accumulation via secretion of various hormones or the action of a nervous system. It is known that continuous intracerebroventricular administration of QRFP43 induces obesity and insulin resistance based on those actions thereof. In addition, QRFP43 is related to secretion of hormones such as hypothalamo-hypophyseal hormone, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQRFP43 or 26RFa expresses its function, when binding to a QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) existing in a central or peripheral nervous system. Accordingly, when QRFP43 or 26RFa is prevented from binding to a QRFP43 receptor (GPR103), then QRFP43 or 26RFa is prevented from expressing its function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds relating to the indole-2-carboxamide derivative of the invention are, for example, in WO2008/002674 (Patent Reference 3). In the compounds in this, a hydrogen atom bonds to the 1-position nitrogen atom of indole; on the other hand, in the compounds of the invention, an alkyl or a haloalkyl is in that site, thus the chemical structure differs in these points. In addition, the compounds described in Patent Reference 3 are a protein kinase inhibitor, and their use differs from those of the QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonist of the invention.\n\n \n \n \n[Non-Patent Reference 1] Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 103, pp. 7438-7443, 2006.\n \n[Patent Reference 1] WO01/16316\n \n[Patent Reference 2] WO05/65702\n \n[Patent Reference 3] WO2008/002674\n \n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblems that the Invention is to Solve\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen QRFP43 or 26RFa is prevented from binding to a QRFP 43 receptor (GPR103), then QRFP43 or 26RFa is prevented from expressing its function; and therefore, a substance antagonistic against the binding of QRFP43 to a QRFP 43 receptor (GPR103) is expected to be useful for prevention and treatment for various QRFP43 or 26RFa-related disorders, for example, circular system disorders such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, renal diseases, heart diseases, vasospasm, etc.; for example, bulimia; metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, hormone secretion abnormality, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, gout, fatty liver, etc. The substance is useful to preventives or remedies for pain, circular rhythm disorders, for example, atherosclerosis, obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), hypertriglyceridemia, hypo-HDL cholesterolemia; circular system disorders such as coronary heart diseases (CRD), cerebrovascular disorders, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases, sudden death, etc.; pain, osteoporosis-related disorders, low back pain, anesthetic hypersensitivity, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a QRFP43 or 26RFa antagonist useful as a preventive or a remedy for the above-mentioned disorders.\n\n\n \nMeans for Solving the Problems\n\n\n \n \n \nAs a result of assiduous studies, the present inventors have found that an indole compound substituted with a specific benzylaminocarbonyl at the 2-position thereof has an excellent human QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonistic activity, and have completed the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the invention provides the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) A compound of a formula (1) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nrepresents a hydrogen atom, a halogen, a C\n1-6 \nalkyl, a halo-C\n1-6 \nalkyl, a C\n1-6 \nalkyloxy, or a halo-C\n1-6 \nalkyloxy;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nrepresents a C\n1-6 \nalkyl, or a halo-C\n1-6 \nalkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3 \nrepresents a hydrogen atom, a C\n1-6 \nalkyl, or a halo-C\n1-6 \nalkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n4 \nrepresents a hydrogen atom, a C\n1-6 \nalkyl, a halo-C\n1-6 \nalkyl, or a C\n3-6 \ncycloalkyl;
