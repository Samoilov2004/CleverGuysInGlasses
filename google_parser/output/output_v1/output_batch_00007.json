No. 61/329,428, filed Apr. 29, 2010, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to azabicycloalkane-indoles, which are melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH-1) receptor antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions including these compounds, and methods of preparation and use thereof. The compounds are useful in the treatment of obesity, anxiety, depression, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nObesity and the multitude of co-morbidities associated with obesity such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers are a major concern for public health. The currently available pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of obesity have limited efficacy and side effects that limit their use. Thus, there is a significant medical need for better pharmacotherapy for obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity has associated with it, economic and social costs. Obese people, an increasing proportion of most western societies, are regarded as having out of control feeding habits often associated with low self-esteem. Moreover, obese persons are more likely to have medical problems associated with or exacerbated by the excess body weight. Examples of medical conditions caused, exacerbated, or triggered by excessive weight include bone fractures, pains in the knee joints, arthritis, increased risk of hypertension, artherosclerosis, stroke, and diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) has been identified as an orexigenic peptide that exerts an effect on food intake and body weight regulation. MCH is a cyclic 19 amino acid neuropeptide expressed in the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus in response to both energy restriction and leptin deficiency. MCH is known to stimulate feeding when injected into the lateral ventricle of rats and the mRNA for MCH is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice (ob/ob) and in fasted control and ob/ob animals. In addition, animals treated with MCH show increases in glucose, insulin and leptin levels, mimicking human metabolic syndrome (Gomori, “Chronic Infusion of MCH Causes Obesity in Mice,” \nAm. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab., \n284:E583 (2002)). Mice lacking MCH are hypophagic and lean with increased metabolic rate, whereas animals over-expressing MCH gain excess weight on both standard and high fat diets. MCH is thought to have effects on other nervous system functions as well (Rocksz, “Biological Examination of Melanin Concentrating Hormone 1: Multi-tasking from the Hypothalamus,” \nDrug News Perspect., \n19(5):273 (2006)). An orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) was recently identified as a receptor for MCH. Disruption of the binding between MCH and the MCH receptor, i.e. MCH antagonism, may thus be used to counteract the effects of MCH (McBriar, “Recent Advances in the Discovery of Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Receptor Antagonists,” \nCurr. Opin. Drug Disc\n. & \nDev., \n9(4):496 (2006)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current preferred treatment for obesity as well as Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes is diet and exercise with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity for diabetics. Patient compliance, however, is usually poor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe problem is compounded by the fact that there are currently only two medications approved for the treatment of obesity (sibutramine (MERIDIA™) and orlistat (XENICAL™)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to overcoming these and other deficiencies in the art.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe

In accordance with the present invention, up to three H atoms in each residue are replaced with alkyl, halogen, haloalkyl, hydroxy, loweralkoxy, carboxy, carboalkoxy (also referred to as alkoxycarbonyl), carboxamido (also referred to as alkylaminocarbonyl), cyano, carbonyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, mercapto, alkylthio, sulfoxide, sulfone, acylamino, amidino, phenyl, benzyl, heteroaryl, phenoxy, benzyloxy, or heteroaryloxy. “Unsubstituted” atoms bear all of the hydrogen atoms dictated by their valency. When a substituent is keto (i.e., =0), then two hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds; by “stable compound” or “stable structure” is meant a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising a compound of formula I and at least one component comprising pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients, or vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents, and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is used to mean any carrier, diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle, as described herein. Examples of suspending agents include ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monosterate and gelatin. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols, suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Examples of excipients include lactose, milk sugar, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, and dicalcium phosphate. Examples of disintegrating agents include starch, alginic acids, and certain complex silicates. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, talc, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means it is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the cells of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms” means dosage forms of the compound of the invention, and includes, for example, tablets, dragees, powders, elixirs, syrups, liquid preparations, including suspensions, sprays, inhalants tablets, lozenges, emulsions, solutions, granules, capsules, and suppositories, as well as liquid preparations for injections, including liposome preparations. Techniques and formulations generally may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., latest edition, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein means those prodrugs of the compounds useful according to the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “prodrug” means compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. Commonly, the conversion of prodrug to drug occurs by enzymatic processes in the liver or blood of the mammal. Many of the compounds of the invention may be chemically modified without absorption into the systemic circulation, and in those cases, activation in vivo may come about by chemical action (as in the acid-catalyzed cleavage in the stomach) or through the intermediacy of enzymes and microflora in the gastrointestinal GI tract. Functional groups which may be rapidly transformed, by metabolic cleavage, in vivo form a class of groups reactive with the carboxyl group of the compounds of this invention. They include, but are not limited to, such groups as alkanoyl (such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, and the like), unsubstituted and substituted aroyl (such as benzoyl and substituted benzoyl), alkoxycarbonyl (such as ethoxycarbonyl), trialkylsilyl (such as trimethyl- and triethysilyl), monoesters formed with dicarboxylic acids (such as succinyl), and the like. Because of the ease with which the metabolically cleavable groups of the compounds useful according to this invention are cleaved in vivo, the compounds bearing such groups act as pro-drugs. The compounds bearing the metabolically cleavable groups have the advantage that they may exhibit improved bioavailability as a result of enhanced solubility and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically cleavable group.

Pharmaceutical acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes of a compound with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polycyclic” or “multi-cyclic” used herein indicates a molecular structure having two or more rings, including, but not limited to, fused, bridged, or spiro rings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTerminology related to “protecting”, “deprotecting,” and “protected” functionalities occurs throughout this application. Such terminology is well understood by persons of skill in the art and is used in the context of processes which involve sequential treatment with a series of reagents. In that context, a protecting group refers to a group which is used to mask a functionality during a process step in which it would otherwise react, but in which reaction is undesirable. The protecting group prevents reaction at that step, but may be subsequently removed to expose the original functionality. The removal or “deprotection” occurs after the completion of the reaction or reactions in which the functionality would interfere. Thus, when a sequence of reagents is specified, as it is in the processes of the invention, the person of ordinary skill can readily envision those groups that would be suitable as “protecting groups.” Suitable groups for that purpose are discussed in standard textbooks in the field of chemistry, such as Greene, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “solvate” refers to a compound of formula I in the solid state, wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in the crystal lattice. A suitable solvent for therapeutic administration is physiologically tolerable at the dosage administered. Examples of suitable solvents for therapeutic administration are ethanol and water. When water is the solvent, the solvate is referred to as a hydrate. In general, solvates are formed by dissolving the compound in the appropriate solvent and isolating the solvate by cooling or using an antisolvent. The solvate is typically dried or azeotroped under ambient conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” is meant to describe an amount of compound of the present invention effective producing the desired therapeutic effect. Such amounts generally vary according to a number of factors well within the purview of ordinarily skilled artisans given the description provided herein to determine and account for. These include, without limitation: the particular subject, as well as its age, weight, height, general physical condition, and medical history, the particular compound used, as well as the carrier in which it is formulated and the route of administration selected for it; and, the nature and severity of the condition being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach chiral center may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-, (−)- and (+)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also envisions the “quaternization” of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. The basic nitrogen can be quaternized with any agents known to those of ordinary skill in the art including, for example, lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides including benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the characterization of some of the substituents, it is recited that certain substituents may combine to form rings. Unless stated otherwise, it is intended that such rings may exhibit various degrees of unsaturation (from fully saturated to fully unsaturated), may include heteroatoms and may be substituted with lower alkyl or alkoxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, R\n1 \nis H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, for example, methyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, R\n2 \nis H.

Radioisotopes of hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous fluorine iodine and chlorine include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n32\nP, \n33\nP, \n125\nI and \n36\nCl, respectively. Compounds that contain those radioisotopes and/or other radioisotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Radiolabeled compounds described herein and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Conveniently, such radiolabeled compounds can be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples and Schemes by substituting a readily available radiolabeled reagent for a non-radiolabeled reagent. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as standards and reagents in determining the binding ability of a potential pharmaceutical. In addition, in the case of stable isotopes, such compounds may have the potential to favorably modify the biological properties, e.g., pharmacological and/or pharmacokinetic properties, of compounds of formula I. The details concerning selection of suitable sites for incorporating radioactive isotopes into the compounds are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention as described herein are useful as MCH-1 receptor antagonists. It may be found upon examination that compounds that are not presently excluded from the claims are not patentable to the inventors in this application. In that case, the exclusion of species and genera in applicants' claims are to be considered artifacts of patent prosecution and not reflective of the inventors' concept or description of their invention. The invention, in a compound aspect, is all compounds of formula I, except those that are in the public's possession.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it may be possible for compounds of formula I to be administered as the raw chemical, it will often be preferable to present them as part of a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Furthermore, when reference is made in an independent claim to a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, it will be understood that claims which depend from that independent claim which refer to such a compound also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound, even if explicit reference is not made to the salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aides, binders, tablet-disintegrating agents, or encapsulating materials. In powders, the carrier may be a finely divided solid which is in admixture with a finely divided compound of formula I. In tablets, the formula I compound may be mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. Said powders and tablets may contain up to 99% by weight of the formula I compound. Solid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes, and ion exchange resins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier suitable for preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs may be employed in the composition of the invention. Compounds of formula I may be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable oil or fat, or a mixture thereof. Said liquid composition may contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, coloring agents, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, osmo-regulators, or the like. Examples of liquid carriers suitable for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) or their derivatives, or oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier may also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate or isopropyl myristate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more other therapeutic adjuncts, e.g., other compounds effective in the treatment of obesity, anxiety, depression, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, that are known to persons of skill in the art. Such other therapeutic adjunts are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with an MCH-1 receptor antagonist. This method involves selecting a patient with a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with an MCH-1 receptor antagonist and administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiseases or conditions which are susceptible to treatment with an MCH-1 receptor antagonist in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, obesity, general anxiety disorders, social phobias, vertigo, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, Parkinson's Disease Psychosis, schizophrenia, cognitive decline and defects in schizophrenia, presenile dementias, Alzheimer's Disease, psychological disorders, depression, substance abuse disorders, dementia associated with neurodegenerative disease, cognition deficits, and epilepsy (see PCT Publication No. WO 2007/010275, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the compounds of the present invention are useful as MCH-1 antagonists. As used in this invention, the term “antagonist” refers to a compound which binds to, and decreases the activity of, a receptor in the presence of an agonist. In the case of a G-protein coupled receptor, activation may be measured using any appropriate second messenger system which is coupled to the receptor in a cell or tissue in which the receptor is expressed. Some specific, but by no means limiting, examples of well-known second messenger systems are adenylate cyclase, intracellular calcium mobilization, ion channel activation, guanylate cyclase, and inositol phospholipid hydrolysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, treatment means any manner in which one or more of the symptoms of a disease or disorder are ameliorated or otherwise beneficially altered. Treatment also encompasses any pharmaceutical use of the compositions herein, such as use for treating diseases or disorders in which MCH-1 receptor activity is implicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the above method further involves administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more therapeutic adjuncts. Suitable therapeutic adjuncts include, but are not limited to, anti-obesity and/or anorectic agents, anti-anxiety agents, anti-depression agents, and anti-non-alcoholic fatty liver disease agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable anti-obesity and/or anorectic adjuncts include, but are not limited to, phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phentermine, a cholecystokinin-A (hereinafter referred to as CCK-A) agonist, a monoamine reuptake inhibitor (such as sibutramine), a sympathomimetic agent, a serotonergic agent (such as dexfenfluramine or fenfluramine), a dopamine agonist (such as bromocriptine), a melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor agonist or mimetic, a melanocyte-stimulating hormone analog, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist or inverse agonist, a melanin concentrating hormone receptor antagonist, a serotonin 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist, a serotonin 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist, the OB protein (hereinafter referred to as “leptin”), a leptin analog, a leptin receptor agonist, the amylin peptide, an amylin analog, an amylin receptor agonist, a neuropeptide Y receptor modulator, a galanin antagonist, or a GI lipase inhibitor or decreaser (such as orlistat).

Description\n\n\n\n\n INDAZOLE DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS ERK INHIBITORS \n\n\nREFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. \n\n\n61/379176 filed on September 1, 2010. \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n This invention related to compounds which can act as inhibitors of kinases, such as ERK, to uses of such compounds and to their preparation \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand-bound cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors such as erbB family, PDGF, FGF, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of the ERK pathway is via a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf, a serine-threonine kinase. \n\n\nActivated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEKl/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK 1/2. When activated, ERK 1/2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation, and it is believed that the ERK MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes, which are upstream of ERK1/2, are mutated in several cancers including colorectal, melanoma, breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition, mutations of BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase of the Raf family, are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas (60%), thyroid cancers (greater than 40%) and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERKl/2 signalling pathway is an attractive pathway for anticancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumors. \n\n\nTherefore, a welcome contribution to the art would be small-molecules (i.e., compounds) that inhibit ERK activity (i.e., ERK1 and ERK2 activity), which small- \n\n molecules would be useful for treating a broad spectrum of cancers, such as, for example, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thryroid cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Such a contribution is provided by this invention. \n\n\n PCT publications WO 2007/070398 Al and WO 2008/153858 Al disclose polycyclic indazole derivatives useful as ER inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: \n\n\n In its many embodiments, the present invention provides a novel class of compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more said compounds, and methods for using said compounds for treating or preventing a disease associated with one or more kinases such as ER l and ERK2. \n\n\n Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a compound of the Formula I: \n\n\n \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or ester thereof, wherein: \n\n\n R is H; \n\n\n R\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of aryl, heterocyclyl and -C(=0)-\n\n\nNR^R^j \n\n\n R\n2\n is H or alkyl; \n\n\n X is selected from the group consisting of -NR\n7\n, -C(R\n8\n)(R\n9\n)-, -0-, -S-, -S(0)-, and -S(0)\n3\n; \n\n\n each R\n3\n independently is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, and -S-alkyl, or wherein two R\n3\n groups together with the same carbon atom to which both are attached form -C(=0)-; \n\n\n m is 0, 1, or 2; \n\n\n n is 0 or 1; \n\n R\n4\n is selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, aryl, -C(=0)-aryl, and -C(=0)-0-aJkyl; \n\n\n R\n5\n, R\n6\n, and R\n7\n independently are H or alkyl; \n\n\n R\n8\n and R\n9\n independently are H, alkyl or aryl; or -C(R\n8\n)(R\n9\n)- together is heterocyclyl. \n\n\n In another aspect, the compounds of Formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof can be useful as protein kinase inhibitors. \n\n\n In another aspect, the compounds of Formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof are useful as protein kinase inhibitors that inhibit the activity of ERK1 and/or the activity of ER 2. \n\n\n In another aspect, the compounds of Formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof are useful as inhibitors of the \n\n\nphosphorylation of ER 1 and ERK2. \n\n\n In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or ester thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n In another aspect, the present invention also provides a method of treating cancer in a patient in need of such treatment, said method comprising administering an effective amount of at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or ester thereof. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n As used above, and throughout this disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings: \n\n\n \"Patient\" includes both human and animals. \n\n\n \"Mammal\" means humans and other mammalian animals. \n\n\n \"At least one\", as used in reference to the number of compounds of this invention means for example 1-6, generally 1-4, more generally 1, 2 or 3, and usually one or two, and more usually one; \n\n \"At least one\", as used in reference to the number of chemotherapeutic agents used, means for example 1-6, generally 1-4, more generally 1, 2 or 3, and usually one or two, or one; \n\n\n \"At least one\", or \"substituted with a (followed by a named substituent)\" as used in reference to the number of substituents attached to a particular group, such as an alkyl group, a cycloalkyi group, a heterocyclyl group, an aryl group and an heteroaryl group, means for example 1-6, generally 1-4, more generally 1, 2 or 3, and usually one or two, or one; \n\n\n \"Alkyl\" means an aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may be straight or branched and comprising about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms in the chain.

Non-limiting examples of suitable heterocyclenyi groups include 1,2,3,4- tetrahydropyridinyl, 1,2-dihydropyridinyI, 1,4-dihydropyridinyl, 1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridinyl, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinyl, 2-pyrrolinyl, 3-pyrrolinyl, 2- imidazolinyl, 2-pyrazolinyl, dihydroimidazolyl, dihydrooxazolyl, dihydrooxadiazolyl, dihydrothiazolyl, 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyranyl\ns\n dihydrofuranyl, fluorodihydrofuranyl, 7- oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenyl, dihydrothiophenyl, dihydrothiopyranyl, and the like. \n\n\n\"Heterocyclenyi\" may also mean a single moiety (e.g., carbonyl) which simultaneously replaces two available hydrogens on the same carbon atom on a ring system. Example of such moiety is pyrrolidinone: \n\n\n \n\n It should be noted that in hetero-atom containing ring systems of this invention, there are no hydroxyl groups on carbon atoms adjacent to a N, O or S, as well as there are no N or S groups on carbon adjacent to another heteroatom. Thus, for example, in the ring: \n\n\n\n\n\n is no -OH attached directly to carbons marked 2 and 5. \n\n\n It should also be noted that tautomeric forms such as, for example, the moieties: \n\n\n\n\n\nare considered equivalent in certain embodiments of this invention. \n\n\n \"Hydroxyalkyl\" means a HOalkyl- group in which alkyl is as previously defined. Preferred hydroxyalkyls contain lower alkyl. Non-limiting examples of suitable hydroxyalkyl groups include hydroxymethyl and 2-hydroxyethyl. \n\n\n \"Acyl\" means an H-C(O)-, alkyl-C(O)- or cycloalkyl-C(O)-, group in which the various groups are as previously described. The bond to the parent moiety is through the carbonyl. Preferred acyls contain a lower alkyl. Non-limiting examples of suitable acyl groups include formyl, acetyl and propanoyl. \n\n\n \"Aroyl\" means an aryl-C(O)- group in which the aryl group is as previously described. The bond to the parent moiety is through the carbonyl. Non-limiting examples of suitable groups include benzoyl and 1- naphthoyl. \n\n\n \"Alkoxy\" means an alkyl-O- group in which the alkyl group is as previously described.

The bond to the parent moiety is through the sulfonyl. \n\n\n \"Arylsulfonyl\" means an aryl-S(0\n2\n)- group. The bond to the parent moiety is through the sulfonyl. \n\n\n The term \"substituted\" means that one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency under the existing circumstances is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. By \"stable compound' or \"stable structure\" is meant a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. \n\n\n The term \"optionally substituted\" means optional substitution with the specified groups, radicals or moieties. \n\n The term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being isolated from a synthetic process (e.g. from a reaction mixture), or natural source or combination thereof. Thus, the term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being obtained from a purification process or processes described herein or well known to the skilled artisan (e.g., chromatography, recrystallization and the like), in sufficient purity to be characterizable by standard analytical techniques described herein or well known to the skilled artisan. \n\n\n It should also be noted that any carbon as well as heteroatom with unsatisfied valences in the text, schemes, examples and Tables herein is assumed to have the sufficient number of hydrogen atom(s) to satisfy the valences. \n\n\n When a functional group in a compound is termed \"protected\", this means that the group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site when the compound is subjected to a reaction. Suitable protecting groups will be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art as well as by reference to standard textbooks such as, for example, T. W. Greene et al, Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York. \n\n\n When any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocyclyl, R\n2\n, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula (I), its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. \n\n\n Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems (1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in \n\n\nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term \"prodrug\" means a compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of \n\n Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and \n\n\nPergamon Press, 1987. \n\n\n For example, if a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (Ci-Csialkyl, (C\n2\n- Cj\n2\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1 -(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1- methyl-l-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, \n\n\nalkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1- (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- 1- (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N- (alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N- (alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4- crotonolactonyl, gamma-bulyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(C i -C2)alkylamino(C2~C3)alkyl (such as β-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C\n1\n-C2)alkyl, N,N-di (Cr \n\n\nC2)alkylcarbamoyl-(Cl-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C\n2\n- C\n3\n)alkyl, and the like. \n\n\n Similarly, if a compound of Formula I contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (Ci~C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, l-((Ci~ \n\n\nC\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1 -methyI-l-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (Q- C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(Ci-C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (Cr C\n6\n)alkanoyl, a-amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkanyl\n!\n arylacyl and a-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a- aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-araino acids, P(0)(OH)\n2\n, -P(0)(0(Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical \n\n resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a \n\n\ncarbohydrate), and the like. \n\n\n If a compound of any one of Formula I incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (Ci-C\n1\no)alkyl, (C3-C7) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl \n\n\n 1 1 is a natural a-aminoacyl or natural a-aminoacyl,— C(OH)C(0)OY wherein Y is H, (Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl or benzyl,™~C(OY\n2\n)Y\n3\n wherein Y\n2\n is (C C\n4\n) alkyl and Y\n3\n is (C \n\n\nC\n6\n)alkyl, carboxy (C C\n6\n)alkyl, amino(C|-C )alkyl or mono-N— or di-N,N-(Cr C6)alkylaminoalkyl\nf\n— C(Y )Y\n5\n wherein Y\n4\n is H or methyl and Y\ns\n is mono-N— or di- N,N-(Cj-C\n6\n)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-l-yl or pyrrolidin-l-yl, and the like. \n\n\n One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \"Solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. \"Hydrate\" is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H\n2\n0. \n\n\n One or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sci., 93(3), 601-611 (2004) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar \n\n\npreparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS PharmSciTech,, 5(1), article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a \n\n rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate). \n\n\n \"Effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the above-noted diseases and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect. \n\n\n The compounds of Formula I can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of Formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of Formulae I may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula I, with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. \n\n\n Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, \n\n\ncamphorsulfonates, ramarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al\n;\n Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) \n\n 1-19; P. Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto. \n\n\n Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quartemized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. \n\n\n All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n- propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, C\n1-\n alkyl, or C\n1-\n alkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, \n\n\nmethanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a C1.20 alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (C\n6-\n24)acyl glycerol. \n\n Compounds of Formula I, and salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention. \n\n\n The compounds of Formula I as set forth herein may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. \n\n\n Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a \n\n\ndiastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula I may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column. \n\n\n It is also possible that the compounds of Formula I may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention. \n\n\n All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and \n\n 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.) Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 974 Recommendations. The use of the terras \"salt\", \"solvate\", \"ester\", \"prodrug\" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds. \n\n\n The present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n,8\n0, \n17\n0, \nI\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n!8\nF, and \n36\nCi, respectively. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. \n\n\nTritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon- 14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopicaliy labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopicaliy labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. \n\n\n Polymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I, are intended to be included in the present invention. \n\n The following abbreviations are used below and have the following meanings:\n\n\nBoc is tert-butoxycarbonyl, dba is dibenzylideneacetone, DMF is N,N- dimethylformamide, DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, EtOAc is ethyl acetate, LCMS is liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, MeOH is methanol, NMR is nuclear magnetic resonance, PBS is phosphate buffered saline, SPA is scintillation proximity assay, Tf is triflate, TFA is trifluoroacetic acid and Xantphos is 9,9-Dimethyl-4,5- bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene.

In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the \"Physicians' Desk \n\n\nReference\" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742, USA), the Physician's Desk Reference, 56\nth\n Edition, 2002 (published by Medical Economics company, Inc. Montvale, NJ 07645-1742), and the Physician's Desk Reference, 57\nth\n Edition, 2003 (published by Thompson PDR, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742); the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. \n\n\n For example, the compounds of formula I can be administered orally (e.g., as a capsule), and the chemotherapeutic agents can be administered intravenously, usually as an intravenous (IV) solution. The use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising more than one drug is within the scope of this invention. \n\n\n The compound of formula I and the chemotherapeutic agents are administered in therapeutically effective dosages to obtain clinically acceptable results, e.g., reduction or elimination of symptoms or of the tumor. Thus, the compound of formula I and chemotherapeutic agents can be administered concurrently or consecutively in a treatment protocol. The administration of the chemotherapeutic agents can be made according to treatment protocols already known in the art. \n\n\n In general when more than one chemotherapeutic agent is used in the methods of this invention, the chemotherapeutic agents are administered on the same day either concurrently or consecutively in their standard dosage form. For example, the chemotherapeutic agents are usually administered intravenously, preferably by an IV drip using IV solutions well known in the art (e.g., isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) or dextrose solution (e.g., 5% dextrose)). \n\n\n When two or more chemotherapeutic agents are used, the chemotherapeutic agents are generally administered on the same day; however, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the chemotherapeutic agents can be administered on different days and in different weeks. The skilled clinician can administer the chemotherapeutic agents according to their recommended dosage schedule from the manufacturer of the agent and can adjust the schedule according to the needs of the patient, e.g., based on \n\n the patient's response to the treatment. For example, when gemcitabine is used in combination with a platinum coordinator compound, such as, for example, cisplatin, to treat lung cancer, both the gemcitabine and the cisplatin are given on the same day on day one of the treatment cycle, and then gemcitabine is given alone on day 8 and given alone again on day 15 \n\n\n The compounds of this invention and chemo therapeutic agents can be administered in a treatment protocol that usually lasts one to seven weeks, and is repeated typically from 6 to 12 times. Generally the treatment protocol can last one to four weeks. Treatment protocols of one to three weeks can also be used. A treatment protocol of one to two weeks can also be used. During this treatment protocol or cycle the compounds of this invention can be administered daily while the chemotherapeutic agents can be administered one or more times a week. Generally, a compound of this invention can be administered daily (i.e., once per day), and in one embodiment twice per day, and the chemotherapeutic agent is administered once a week or once every three weeks. For example, the taxanes (e.g., Paclitaxel (e.g., Taxol\n®\n) or Docetaxel (e.g.,Taxotere\n®\n)) can be administered once a week or once every three weeks. \n\n\n However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that treatment protocols can be varied according to the needs of the patient. Thus, the combination of compounds (drugs) used in the methods of this invention can be administered in variations of the protocols described above. For example, the compounds of this invention can be administered discontinuously rather than continuously during the treatment cycle. Thus, for example, during the treatment cycle the compounds of this invention can be administered daily for a week and then discontinued for a week, with this \n\n\nadministration repeating during the treatment cycle. Or the compounds of this invention can be administered daily for two weeks and discontinued for a week, with this administration repeating during the treatment cycle. Thus, the compounds of this invention can be administered daily for one or more weeks during the cycle and discontinued for one or more weeks during the cycle, with this pattern of administration repeating during the treatment cycle. This discontinuous treatment can also be based upon numbers of days rather than a full week. For example, daily dosing for 1 to 6 \n\n days, no dosing for 1 to 6 days with this pattern repeating during the treatment protocol. The number of days (or weeks) wherein the compounds of this invention are not dosed do not have to equal the number of days (or weeks) wherein the compounds of this invention are dosed. Usually, if a discontinuous dosing protocol is used, the number of days or weeks that the compounds of this invention are dosed is at least equal or greater than the number of days or weeks that the compounds of this invention are not dosed. \n\n\n The chemotherapeutic agent could be given by bolus or continuous infusion. The chemotherapeutic agent could be given daily to once every week, or once every two weeks, or once every three weeks, or once every four weeks during the treatment cycle. If administered daily during a treatment cycle, this daily dosing can be discontinuous over the number of weeks of the treatment cycle. For example, dosed for a week (or a number of days), no dosing for a week (or a number of days, with the pattern repeating during the treatment cycle. \n\n\n For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), Remingto 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth\n Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania. \n\n\n Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. \n\n\n Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen. \n\n Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral \n\n\nadministration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose. \n\n\n The compounds of this invention may also be delivered subcutaneously. \n\n\n Preferably the compound is administered orally or intravenously or intrathecally or some suitable combination(s) thereof. \n\n\n Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. \n\n\n The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.001 mg to about 500 mg. In one embodiment, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is from about 0.01 mg to about 250 mg. In another embodiment, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg. In another embodiment, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is from about 1.0 mg to about 100 mg. In another embodiment, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is from about 1.0 mg to about 50 mg. In still another embodiment, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is from about 1.0 mg to about 25 mg. \n\n\n The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required. \n\n\n The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size \n\n of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical \n\n\nrecommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 0.01 mg day to about 2000 mg/day of the compounds of the present invention. In one embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to 1000 mg/day. In another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to 500 mg/day. In another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 100 mg/day to 500 mg/day. In another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to 250 mg/day. In another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 100 mg/day to 250 mg/day. In still another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to 100 mg/day. In still another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 50 mg/day to 100 mg/day. In a further embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to 50 mg/day. In another embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day. In a further embodiment, a daily dosage regimen for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to 25 mg/day. The daily dosage may be administered in a single dosage or can be divided into from two to four divided doses. \n\n\n If the patient is responding, or is stable, after completion of the therapy cycle, the therapy cycle can be repeated according to the judgment of the skilled clinician. Upon completion of the therapy cycles, the patient can be continued on the compounds of this invention at the same dose that was administered in the treatment protocol. This maintenance dose can be continued until the patient progresses or can no longer tolerate the dose (in which case the dose can be reduced and the patient can be continued on the reduced dose). \n\n\n The chemotherapeutic agents, used with the compounds of this invention, are administered in their normally prescribed dosages during the treatment cycle (i.e., the chemotherapeutic agents are administered according to the standard of practice for the administration of these drugs). For example: (a) about 30 to about 300 mg/m for the taxanes; (b) about 30 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n for Cisplatin; (c) AUC of about 2 to about 8 for Carboplatin; (d) about 2 to about 4 mg/m\n2\n for EGF inhibitors that are antibodies; (e) \n\n about 50 to about 500 mg/m\n2\n for EGF inhibitors that are small molecules; (f) about 1 to about 10 mg m\n2\n for VEGF kinase inhibitors that are antibodies; (g) about 50 to about 2400 mg/m\n2\n for VEGF inhibitors that are small molecules; (h) about 1 to about 20 mg for SERMs; (i) about 500 to about 1250 mg/m\n2\n for the anti-tumor nucleosides 5- Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine and Capecitabine; (j) for the anti-tumor nucleoside \n\n\nCytarabine (Ara-C) 100-200mg/m\n2\n/day for 7 to 10 days every 3 to 4 weeks, and high doses for refractory leukemia and lymphoma, i.e., 1 to 3 gm/m for one hour every 12 hours for 4-8 doses every 3 to four weeks; (k) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Fludarabine (F-ara-A) 10-25mg/m\n2\n/day every 3 to 4 weeks; (1) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Decitabine 30 to 75 mg/m\n2\n for three days every 6 weeks for a maximum of 8 cycles; (m) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA, 2-CdA) 0.05-0.1 mg kg/day as continuous infusion for up to 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks; (n) about 1 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n for epothilones; (o) about 1 to about 350 mg/m\n2\n for topoisomerase inhibitors; (p) about 1 to about 50 mg/m\n2\n for vinca alkaloids; (q) for the folate antagonist Methotrexate (MTX) 20-60 mg/m\n2\n by oral, IV or IM every 3 to 4 weeks, the intermediate dose regimen is 80-250 mg/m\n2\n IV over 60 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks, and the high dose regimen is 250-1000mg/m\n2\n IV given with leucovorin every 3 to 4 weeks; (r) for the folate antagonist Premetrexed (Alimta) 300-600 mg/m (10 minutes IV infusion day 1) every 3 weeks; (s) for the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor \n\n\nHydroxyurea (HU) 20-50 mg/kg/day (as needed to bring blood cell counts down); (t) the platinum coordinator compound Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) 50-100 mg/m\n2\n every 3 to 4 weeks (preferably used for solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer); (u) for the anthracycline daunorubicin 10-50 mg/m /day IV for 3-5 days every 3 to 4 weeks; (v) for the anthracycline Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 50-100 mg/m\n2\n IV continuous infusion over 1-4 days every 3 to 4 weeks, or 10-40 mg/m\n2\n IV weekly; (w) for the anthracycline Idarubicin 10-30 mg m\n2\n daily for 1-3 days as a slow IV infusion over 10-20 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks; (x) for the biologic interferon (Intron-A, Roferon) 5 to 20 million IU three times per week; (y) for the biologic pegylated interferon (Peg-intron, Pegasys) 3 to 4 micrograms/kg/day chronic sub cutaneous (until relapse or loss of activity); (z) for the biologic Rituximab \n\n\n(Rituxan) (antibody used for non-Hodgkm's lymphoma) 200-400mg/m\n2\n IV weekly \n\n over 4-8 weeks for 6 months; (aa) for the alkylating agent temozolomide 75 mg/m\n2\n to\n\n\n250mg/m \"7 , for example, 150 rng/m 2 , or for example, 200 mg/m 2 , such as 200mg/m 2 for 5 days; and (bb) for the ME 1 and/or MEK2 inhibitor PD0325901, 15 mg to 30 mg, for example, 15 mg daily for 21 days every 4 weeks. \n\n\n Gleevec can be used orally in an amount of about 200 to about 800 mg/day.\n\n\nThalidomide (and related imids) can be used orally in amounts of about 200 to about 800 mg/day, and can be contiuously dosed or used until releapse or toxicity. See for example Mitsiades et al, \"Apoptotic signaling induced by immunomodulatory thalidomide analoqs in human multiple myeloma cells; therapeutic implications\", Blood, 99(12):4525-30\ns\n June 15, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. \n\n\n The FPT inhibitor Sarasar® (brand of lomfarnib) can be administered orally (e.g., capsule) in amounts of about 50 to about 200 mg given twice a day, or in amounts of about 75 to about 125 mg given twice a day, or in amounts of about 100 to about 200 mg given twice a day, or in an amount of about 100 mg given twice a day. \n\n\n Paclitaxel (e.g., Taxol\n®\n, for example, can be administered once per week in an amount of about 50 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n and in another example about 60 to about 80 mg/m\n2\n. In another example Paclitaxel (e.g., Taxol\n®\n can be administered once every three weeks in an amount of about 150 to about 250 mg/m and in another example about 175 to about 225 mg/m\n2\n. \n\n\n In another example, Docetaxel (e.g., Taxotere\n®\n) can be administered once per week in an amount of about 10 to about 45 mg/m\n2\n. In another example Docetaxel (e.g., Taxotere\n®\n) can be administered once every three weeks in an amount of about 50 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n. \n\n\n In another example Cisplatin can be administered once per week in an amount of about 20 to about 40 mg/m\n2\n. In another example Cisplatin can be administered once every three weeks in an amount of about 60 to about 100 mg/m . \n\n\n In another example Carboplatin can be administered once per week in an amount to provide an AUC of about 2 to about 3. In another example Carboplatin can \n\n be administered once every three weeks in an amount to provide an AUC of about 5 to about 8. \n\n\n Those skilled in the art will recognize that the actual dosages and protocols for administration employed in the methods of this invention may be varied according to the judgment of the skilled clinician. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. A determination to vary the dosages and protocols for administration may be made after the skilled clinician takes into account such factors as the patient's age, condition and size, as well as the severity of the cancer being treated and the response of the patient to the treatment. \n\n\n The amount and frequency of administration of the compound of formula I and the chemotherapeutic agents will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the cancer being treated. \n\n\n The chemotherapeutic agent can be administered according to therapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent can be varied depending on the cancer being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent on that disease. Also, in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be varied in view of the observed effects of the administered therapeutic agents on the patient, and in view of the observed responses of the cancer to the administered therapeutic agents. \n\n\n The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician. \n\n\n The particular choice of chemotherapeutic agent will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgement of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. \n\n\n The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of the chemotherapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well \n\n within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the cancer being treated and the condition of the patient \n\n\n Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of an chemotherapeutic agent according to the individual patient's needs, as the treatment proceeds. All such modifications are within the scope of the present invention. \n\n\n The particular choice of antihormonal agents, optional chemotherapeutic agents and optional radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. \n\n\n The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of the antihormonal agents, optional chemotherapeutic agents and optional radiation during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the breast cancer being treated and the condition of the patient. \n\n\n Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of antihormonal agents, optional chemotherapeutic agents and optional radiation according to the individual patient's needs, as the treatment proceeds. All such modifications are within the scope of the present invention. \n\n\n The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of cancer-related symptoms (e.g., pain, cough (for lung cancer), and shortness of breath (for lung cancer)), inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MR1 scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention can be made according to the processes described below. \n\n Commonly used Abbreviations \n\n\n ACN Acetonitrile \n\n\n AcOH Acetic acid \n\n\n DAST (diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride \n\n\n DCC Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide \n\n\n DCU Dicyclohexylurea \n\n\n DCM Dichloromethane \n\n\n DIAD Diisopropylazodicarboxylate \n\n\n DIE A Diisopropylethylamine \n\n\n DMAP 4-Dimethylaminopyridine \n\n\n DME Dimethoxyethane \n\n\n DMF Dimethylformamide \n\n\n DMFDMA Ν,Ν-Dirnethylformamide dimethylacetal \n\n\n DMSO Dimethyl sulfoxide \n\n\n DTT Dithiothreitol \n\n\n EDCI 1 -(3 -dimethylamino-propyl)-3 -ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n\n\nEtOAc Ethyl acetate \n\n\n EtOH Ethanol \n\n\n HATU N,N,N',N'-Tetramethyl-0-(7-Azabenzotriazol-l -yl)Uronium hexafluorophosphate \n\n\n H\n2\n0 water \n\n\n Hex hexanes \n\n\n HOBt 1-Hydroxylbenzotriazole \n\n\n HPLC High pressure liquid chromatography \n\n\n LCMS Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry \n\n\n LDA Lithium diisopropylamide \n\n\nmCPBA meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid \n\n\n MeOH Methanol \n\n\n MTT (3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, \n\n\n Thiazolyl blue) \n\n\n NaH Sodium hydride \n\n NMR Nuclear magnetic resonance \n\n\n PFP Pentafiuorophenol \n\n\n PMB p-methoxybenzyl \n\n\n Pyr Pyridine \n\n\n RT Room temperature \n\n\n SEMC1 2-(Trimethylsily)ethoxy methyl chloride \n\n\n TEA Triethylamine \n\n\n Tr Triphenyl methane \n\n\n TrCI Triphenyl methane chloride \n\n\n TFA Trifluoroacetic acid \n\n\n THF Tetrahydrofuran \n\n\n TLC Thin layer chromatography \n\n\n TMS Trimethylsilyl \n\n\nAnalytical method \n\n\nThe LCMS conditions are: (1) column: C-18 reverse phase, Sum, 4.6 x 50 mm, (2) S:PE Sciex API-150EX, and (3) HPLC: Shimadzu LC-10 ADvp, Iml/min, linerar gradient 10% acetonitirle in water to 95% acetonitrile in water, both contain 0.05% TFA \n\n\nCompound Synthesis \n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can be made according to the processes described in the schemes below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R = H\n\n\n 2 = H \n\n\n Scheme 1 \n\n\n5-Nitro-3-(pyridin-4-yi)-l-trifyI-lH-indazoIe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3-Bromo-5-nitro-l-trityl-lH-indazole (1 g, 0.002 mol) was added to a vial containing pyridin-4-ylboronic acid (0.279 g, 0.00227 mol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium (0.1155 g, 0.0001 mol).

The TdF assay was mainly conducted in the 96-well based CHROMO-4 real time fluorescence plate reader (BioRad). The Sypro Orange (Sigma-Aldrich), environmentally sensitive fluorescence dye, was used to monitor the protein folding-unfolding transition. Protein-ligand binding was gauged by the change (or shift) in the \n\n\nunfolding transition temperature (AT\nm\n) acquired at protein alone with respect to protein in the presence of ligand of interest \n\n\n Compound of interest was first prepared in DMSO stock (typical concentration: \n\n\n1 OmM). Sample of 20μΙ. was then added into the 96-well PCR plate, where it consisted of 3μΜ ERK protein and 15, 50 or ΙΟΟμΜ compound (depending on compound's solubility) in buffer (25 raM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH=7.5 and ImM DTT) incorporated with Sypro Orange dye (5X final concentration). Final percentage of DMSO resided in the sample was 2%. The sample plate was heated from 30°C to 90°C with thermal ramping rate of l°C/min. The fluorescence signals were acquired with excitation and emission wavelengths centered at 490 and 560 nm respectively. The instrument thermal stability was ±0.2°C. The melting temperatures (T\nm\n) for ERK protein under aforementioned conditions occurred at 61.0±0.2°C and 64.8±0.2°C respectively. \n\n\nTheoretical basis for TdF-based ligand binding affinity constant \n\n\nThe derivation of TdF-based ligand binding affinity constant (K\nd\n) followed closely those previously formulated by Brandts and Lin [2]. In brief, the binding constant of the ligand at the T\nm\n is expressed as below: \n\n _ {exp{-(Ai¾(7O) / R)(l I Tm - \\ I To) + (ACp» ! R)[ln(T\nm\n ! To) + (To I Tm) - 1]} - 1} where To is the midpoint of unfolding for unliganded protein and T\nm\n is the midpoint of unfolding in presence of ligand. [Lj\nm\n] is free ligand at T\nm\n. The W\nu\n and ACp\nu\n are the enthalpy of unfolding and heat capacity change of unfolding for the protein \n\n\nrespectively. Following algorithm derived by Winsor and coworker [3], the To, AH^ and ACp \nu\n can be determined separately from nonlinear regression fitting the protein alone melting curve: \n\n\n(K + m»(T)) + (r. +mm) exp{-(^¾(l - ¾ + (^¾(Γ ln(~) + To - T)} \n\n\n Rl J O Rl To \n\n\n 1 + exp{-(—— )(1 -— ) + i— r ( ln(— ) + Γο - T)} \n\n\nWhere F(T) is the observed fluorescence intensity at any temperature T, Y\nn\n and Y\nv\n are the predicted fluorescence intensities for fully folded and unfolded protein, \n\n\nrespectively; m\nn\n and m are slope correction for changes in Y\nR\n and Y\nu\n with respect to changes in temperature (analogously replace To with T\nm\n in the above equation for liganded protein to yield T\nm\n). \n\n\nFinally, the ligand binding affinity constant at any temperature T (i.e. 25°C) can be thermodynamicall connected to the preceding Ki(T\nm\n) via [2,3] \n\n\nΚι(Τ) = ΚιίΤ» - JL) + (-¾[ln + 1 - ¾\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere is the van't Hoff enthalpy of ligand binding at temperature T and ACpt is the heat capacity upon ligand binding. For simplicity, the ACp^ and H (T) were set to zero and -7 kcal/mol respectively. The uncertainty in the calculated ligand binding affinity constant was estimated to be ±50%. \n\n References \n\n\n 1. M.W. Pantoliano, E.C. Petrella, J.D. Kwasnoski, V.S. Lobanov, J. Myslik, E.

Ιμΐ of 25x compound was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow an opportunity for the compound to bind to the inactive enzyme. DMSO concentration during initial incubation is 6.7%. ERK2 activity was determined to be insensitive to DMSO concentrations up to 20%. ERK2 was then activated and it's kinase activity measured by the addition of ΙΟμΙ kinase buffer with the following components (final concentration per reaction): 2ng active (phosphorylated) human MEKl protein and 4μΜ (total) ERK2 IMAP substrate peptides (3.9μΜ unlabeled IPXXPIXTTYFFFK-CONH2 and lOOnM IPTXPITTTYFFFK(5-carboxyfluorescein)- CONH2 ) and 30μΜ ATP. DMSO concentration during ERK activation was 4%. After one hour, reactions were terminated by addition of 60 μΐ IMAP detections beads in binding buffer (Molecular Devices). Binding was allowed to equilibrate for 30 \n\n minutes before reading the plate on an LJL Analyst Fluorescence Polarization plate reader. Compound inhibition was calculated relative to DMSO and fully inhibited standards. Active compounds were reconfirmed in an independent assay. \n\n\nActive ERK2 (aERK) Assay: \n\n\n Activated ERK2 activity was also determined in the IMAP assay format using the procedure outlined above. 1 μΐ of 25x compound was added to 14μ1 of kinase buffer containing 0.25ng fully phosphorylated, active Mouse ERK2 protein. Following a 30 minute incubation, the reactions were initiated by addition of ΙΟμΙ of kinase buffer containing ΙμΜ ERK2 IMAP substrate peptide (0.9μΜ unlabeled IPTTPITTTYFFFK- CONH2 and lOOnM IPTTPITTTYFFFK(5-carboxyfluorescein)-CONH2 ) and 30μΜ ATP. Reactions proceeded for 30 minutes before termination by addition of 60 μΐ IMAP detection beads in binding buffer. Plates were read as above after 30 minute binding equilibration. Active compounds were reconfirmed in an independent assay. \n\n\n Values for Kd TdF (nM), cERK IC50 (nM) and aERK IC50 (nM) for individual compounds have been set forth above in above Tables. In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention have aERK IC50 values of from about 0.05 nM to 1 μΜ; and in a preferred embodiment, less than 100 nM (< 100 nM); and in a more preferred embodiment less than 10 nM (< 10 nM). \n\n\n While the present invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and variations thereof will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such alternatives, modifications and variations are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention. \n\n\n Each and every reference publication referred to hereinabove is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes."
