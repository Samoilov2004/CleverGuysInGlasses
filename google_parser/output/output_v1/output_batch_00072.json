Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUpon damage to a blood vessel, subendothelial structures are exposed that mediate platelet adhesion through interaction with von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF forms a bridge between collagen within the damaged vessel wall and the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (gpIb), an interaction especially important under high shear conditions, leading to the formation of a haemostatic plug and thus preventing excessive bleeding (\nBennett S, Thromb Haemost (2001) Mar;85(3):395-400\n). During normal haemostasis, these processes lead to wound healing of the damaged blood vessel wall. In pathological conditions however, excessive platelet function may lead to thrombus formation. The vWF subunit is composed of several homologues domains each covering different functions. vWF interacts through its A3 domain with fibrillar collagen fibers and through its A1 domain with the platelet receptor gplb. Under normal conditions platelets and vWF do not interact. However, when vWF is bound to collagen at high shear rate, it is believed to undergo a conformational change allowing its binding with the platelet receptor gplb. This reversible adhesion allows platelets to roll over the damaged area, which is then followed by a firm adhesion through the collagen receptors on the platelets (gpia/IIa, gpVI, gpIV, p65, TIIICBP) resulting in platelet activation. This leads to activation of the gpIIb/IIIa receptor, fibrinogen binding, and finally to platelet aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet aggregation inhibitors have been isolated from blood sucking organisms such as leech. Saratin, derived from leech \nHirudo medicinalis\n is described in \n \nWO 02/15919 A2\n \n and in \nCruz CP et al ref. Saratin, an inhibitor of von Willebrand factor-dependent platelet adhesion, decreases platelet aggregation and intimal hyperplasia in a rat carotid endarterectomy model. Journal of Vascular Surgery, 2001, 34: 724-729\n and in \nSmith TP et al, Saratin, an inhibitor of collagen-platelet interaction, decreases venous anastomotic intimal hyperplasia in a canine dialysis access model, Vasc Endovascular Surg. 2003 Jul-Aug;37(4):259-69\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-based therapeutics have been developed, some of which are currently used in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbciximab (Chimeric 7E3 Fab; ReoPro; \n \nUS 6,071,514\n \n, \n \n \nEP\n 0 882 453\n \n), the Fab fragment of the mouse human chimeric antibody 7E3 which inhibits ligand binding to the platelet gpIIb/IIIa receptor, was approved for human use as adjunctive therapy to prevent ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary interventions in December 1994. The principle safety issue with gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors is the risk of bleeding, as the potent anti-platelet effect of these drugs may adversely affect haemostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA murine monoclonal antibody was developed against vWF A1 domain (\n \nUS 2002/0028204 A1\n \n ; \n \nUS 6,280,731\n \n and in \n \nWO 00/10601\n \n) and against its active conformation (\n \nUS 6,251,393\n \n). The \nin vivo\n efficacy is described in \nKageyama S, et al :\"\nEffect of a humanized monoclonal antibody to von Willebrand factor in a canine model of coronary arterial thrombosis\n\", Eur J Pharmacol. 2002 May 17;443(1-3):143-9\n, and in \"\nAnti-human vWF monoclonal antibody, AJvW-2 Fab, inhibits repetitive coronary artery thrombosis without bleeding time prolongation in dogs\". Thromb Res., 2001 Mar 1;101 (5):395-404\n. and in \"\nAnti-human von willebrand factor monoclonal antibody AJvW-2 prevents thrombus deposition and neointima formation after balloon injury in guinea pigs\". Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2000 Oct;20(10):2303-8\n). AJvW-2 inhibited high shear stress induced aggregation of human platelets and had no effect on low shear stress induced platelet aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects in baboons of a murine antibody 82D6A3 raised against the A3 domain of human vWF, are disclosed in \n \nWO 02/051351\n \n, and \nDongmei Wu et al, \"\ninhibition of the von Willebrand (VWF)-collagen interaction by an antihuman VWF monoclonal antibody results in abolition of in vivo arterial platelet thrombus formation in baboons\n\". Hemostasis, thrombosis and vascular biology, 2002, 99: 3623-3628\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody 6B4 is a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) raised against purified human gplb. MoAb 6B4 inhibits both ristocetin- and botrocetin-induced, vWF-dependent human platelet agglutination. MoAb 6B4 furthermore blocks shear-induced adhesion of human platelets to collagen I. When injected into baboons, intact IgG and its F(ab')(2) fragments caused almost immediate thrombocytopenia, due to the bivalency of F(ab')(2) which mediates platelet crosslinking, or Fc:Fc receptor interactions which mediate activation of platelet aggregation (\n \nWO 0110911\n \n; \nCauwenberghs N. et a/, Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular biology, 2000, 20: 1347\n and see, for example, \nCadroy Y et al, Blood, 1994, 83: 3218-3224\n, \nBecker BH et al, Blood, 1989, 74: 690-694\n, \nRavanat C. et al, Thromb. Haemost. 1999 , 82 : 528a \nabstract). Platelet deposition onto collagen-rich bovine pericardium was inhibited when Fab fragments were injected into the baboons before a thrombus was generated. However, when the Fab fragments were injected after a thrombus was allowed to form, no inhibition of further thrombosis was observed. The yields of expression of said Fab molecules are very low and the method of production is very labour intensive.\n\n\n \n\n\nTHE AIMS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn aim of the present invention is to provide polypeptides comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed towards vWF, vWF A1 domain, A1 domain of activated vWF, vWF A3 domain, gplb and/or collagen, homologues of said polypeptides, and/or functional portions of said polypeptides, for the treatment for conditions which require a modulation of platelet-mediated aggregation and which overcomes the problems of the prior art.

to a polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies each directed against a target and the finding that the construct has a modulating effect on platelet-mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n\n\nTargets\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, a target is any of vWF, vWF A1 domain, A1 domain of activated vWF, vWF A3 domain, gplb or collagen. Said targets are mammalian, and are derived from species such as rabbits, goats, mice, rats, cows, calves, camels, llamas, monkeys, donkeys, guinea pigs, chickens, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, and preferably humans. The sequence of human vWF is provided in Table 30, SEQ ID NO: 48.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA target is also a fragment of vWF, vWF A1 domain, A1 domain of activated vWF, vWF A3 domain, gplb or collagen, capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of vWF, vWF A1 domain, A1 domain of activated vWF, vWF A3 domain, gplb or collagen, capable of binding to a single domain antibody raised against the 'parent' full length target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% etc.), but comprising 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 x 10\n-6\n M or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantially alter the ability of the target to bind to a single domain antibody raised against the wild-type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single domain antibody directed against a target means single domain antibody that it is capable of binding to its target with an affinity of better than 10\n-6\n M.\n\n\n \n\n\nSingle domain antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSingle domain antibodies are antibodies whose complementary determining regions are part of a single domain polypeptide. Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain antibodies, antibodies naturally devoid of light chains, single domain antibodies derived from conventional 4-chain antibodies, engineered antibodies and single domain scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be any of the art, or any future single domain antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, goat, rabbit, bovine. According to one aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody as used herein is a naturally occurring single domain antibody known as heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain antibodies are disclosed in \n \nWO 9404678\n \n for example. For clarity reasons, this variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a \nVHH\n or \nnanobody\n to distinguish it from the conventional VH of four chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in \nCamelidae\n species, for example in camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca and guanaco. Other species besides \nCamelidae\n may produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain; such VHHs are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVHHs, according to the present invention, and as known to the skilled addressee are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from \nCamelidae\n as described in \n \nWO9404678\n \n (and referred to hereinafter as VHH domains or nanobodies). VHH molecules are about 10x smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, \nin vitro\n expression of VHHs produces high yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, antibodies generated in \nCamelids\n will recognize epitopes other than those recognised by antibodies generated \nin vitro\n through the use of antibody libraries or via immunisation of mammals other than \nCamelids\n (\n \nWO 9749805\n \n). As such, anti-albumin VHH's may interact in a more efficient way with serum albumin which is known to be a carrier protein. As a carrier protein some of the epitopes of serum albumin may be inaccessible by bound proteins, peptides and small chemical compounds. Since VHH's are known to bind into 'unusual' or non-conventional epitopes such as cavities (\n \nWO9749805\n \n), the affinity of such VHH's to circulating albumin may be increased.\n\n\n \n\n\nClasses of VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention further relates to a polypeptide construct, wherein a single domain antibody is a VHH directed to a target mentioned herein, wherein the VHH belongs to a class having human-like sequences. The class is characterised in that the VHHs carry an amino acid from the group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, serine, threonine, asparagine, or glutamine at position 45, such as, for example, L45 according to the Kabat numbering. A VHH sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 3 which bind to vWF, belong to this human-like class of VHH polypeptides. As such, peptides belonging to this class show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the direct administration of a polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3 to a patient in need of the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother human-like class of \nCamelidae\n single domain antibodies represented by SEQ ID No. 16 and 18 have been described in \n \nWO 03/035694\n \n and contain the hydrophobic FR2 residues typically found in conventional antibodies of human origin or from other species, but compensating this loss in hydrophilicity by a number of residues such as the charged arginine residue, serine or uncharged residues such as glycine at position 103 that substitutes the conserved tryptophan residue present in VH from double-chain antibodies. As such, peptides belonging to these two classes show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the VHHs as used by the invention may be of the traditional class or of the classes of human-like \nCamelidae\n antibodies. Said antibodies may be directed against whole targets or a fragment thereof. These polypeptides include the full length \nCamelidae\n antibodies, namely Fc and VHH domains, chimeric versions of heavy chain \nCamelidae\n antibodies with a human Fc domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a target may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a polypeptide construct comprises anti-target single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against the same target, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another aspect of the invention that the polypeptide construct comprises two or more single domain antibodies, wherein any two single domain antibodies are directed against different targets i.e. against any of vWF, vWF A1 domain, A1 domain of activated vWF, vWF A3 domain, gplb and collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a bispecific polypeptide construct comprising a single domain antibody directed against vWF A1 domain, A1 domain of activated vWF, and another single domain antibody directed against vWF A3 domain. Said bispecific polypeptide construct inhibits the interaction between vWF and collagen, and the interaction between vWF and platelets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the present invention a polypeptide construct may comprise two or more single domain antibodies which have been joined. The single domain antibodies may be identical in sequence and directed against the same target or antigen. Depending on the number of VHHs linked, a multivalent VHH may be bivalent (2 VHHs), trivalent (3 VHHs), tetravalent (4 VHHs) or have a higher valency molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that a polypeptide construct as disclosed herein further comprising one or more single domain antibodies each directed against a serum protein of a subject, surprisingly has significantly prolonged half-life in the circulation of said subject compared with the half-fife of the anti-target single domain antibody(ies) when not part of said construct. Furthermore, the said constructs were found to exhibit the same favourable properties of VHHs such as high stability remaining intact in mice, extreme pH resistance, high temperature stability and high target affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such constructs are represented by SEQ ID No. 13 to 15, which comprise anti-vWF VHH and anti-mouse serum albumin VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 13 to 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of such constructs are represented by SEQ ID No. 42 to 45, which comprise humanized anti-vWF VHH and anti-mouse serum albumin VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 42 to 45.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject, or fragment thereof. In one aspect of the invention, the serum protein is serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, or fibrinogen. Depending on the intended use such as the required half-life for effective treatment and/or compartimentalisation of the target antigen, the VHH-partner can be directed to one of the above serum proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of single domain antibodies directed against serum albumin are the sequences represented by the sequences corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 16 to 19 and 49 to 61. Therefore another aspect of the invention is a polypeptide construct further comprising one or more anti-serum single domain antibodes, wherein the sequence of a anti-serum single domain antibody corresponds to any represented by SEQ ID NOs: 16 to 19 and 49 to 61.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch constructs are able to circulate in the subject's serum for several days, reducing the frequency of treatment, the inconvenience to the subject and resulting in a decreased cost of treatment. Furthermore, it is an aspect of the invention that the half-life of the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein may be controller by the number of anti-serum protein single domain antibodies present in the construct. A controllable half-life is desirable in several circumstances, for example, in the application of a timed dose of a therapeutic polypeptide construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct as mentioned herein, further comprising a thrombolytic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaid thrombolytic agent may be non-covalently or covalently attached to a single domain antibody \nvia\n covalent or non-covalent means. Such covalent means are described below. Non-covalent means include \nvia\n a protein interaction such as biotin/strepavidin, or \nvia\n an immunoconjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the thrombolytic agent may be administered simultaneous, separate or sequential in respect of a polypeptide construct of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a composition comprising at least one polypeptide construct as disclosed herein and at least one thrombolytic agent, for simultaneous, separate or sequential administration to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention is a method for treating autoimmune disease comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of at least one polypeptide construct of the invention and at least one thrombolytic agent, simultaneously, separately or sequentially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a kit containing at least one polypeptide construct of the invention and at least one thrombolytic agent for simultaneous, separate or sequential administration to a subject. It is an aspect of the invention that the kit may be used according to the invention. It is an aspect of the invention that the kit may be used to treat the diseases as cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy simultaneous administration means the polypeptide and thrombolytic agent are administered to a subject at the same time. For example, as a mixture or a composition comprising said components. Examples include, but are not limited to a solution administered intraveneously, a tablet, liquid, topical cream, etc., wherein each preparation comprises the components of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy separate administration means polypeptide and thrombolytic agent are administered to a subject at the same time or substantially the same time. The components are present in the kit as separate, unmixed preparations. For example, the polypeptide and thrombolytic agent may be present in the kit as individual tablets. The tablets may be administered to the subject by swallowing both tablets at the same time, or one tablet directly following the other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy sequential administration means the polypeptide and thrombolytic agent are administered to a subject sequentially. The polypeptide and thrombolytic agent are present in the kit as separate, unmixed preparations. There is a time interval between doses. For example, one component might be administered up to 336, 312, 288, 264, 240, 216, 192, 168, 144, 120, 96, 72, 48, 24, 20, 16, 12, 8, 4, 2, 1, or 0.5 hours after the other component.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn sequential administration, one component may be administered once, or any number of times and in various doses before and/or after administration of another component. Sequential administration may be combined with simultaneous or sequential administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe medical uses of the polypeptide construct described below, also apply to the composition comprising a polypeptide construct as disclosed herein and at least one polypeptide thrombolytic agent, for simultaneous, separate or sequential administration to a subject as disclosed here above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombolytic agents according to the invention may include, for example, staphylokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, single chain streptokinase, urokinase and acyl plasminogen streptokinase complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe single domain antibodies may be joined to form any of the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein comprising more than one single domain antibody using methods known in the art or any future method. For example, they may be fused by chemical cross-linking by reacting amino acid residues with an organic derivatisation agent such as described by \nBlattler et al, \n; \n \nEP294703\n \n. Alternatively, the single domain antibody may be fused genetically at the DNA level \ni.e\n. a polynucleotide construct formed which encodes the complete polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies and one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. A method for producing bivalent or multivalent VHH polypeptide constructs is disclosed in \n \nPCT patent application WO 96/34103\n \n. One way of joining multiple single domain antibodies is via the genetic route by linking single domain antibody coding sequences either directly or \nvia\n a peptide linker. For example, the C-terminal end of the first single domain antibody may be linked to the N-terminal end of the next single domain antibody. This linking mode can be extended in order to link additional single domain antibodies for the construction and production of tri-, tetra-, etc. functional constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide constructs disclosed herein may be made by the skilled artisan according to methods known in the art or any future method. For example, VHHs may be obtained using methods known in the art such as by immunising a camel and obtaining hybridoma's therefrom, or by cloning a library of single domain antibodies using molecular biology techniques known in the art and subsequent selection by using phage display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to the finding that polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 7 as in Table 30 derived from \nCamelidae\n VHHs, bind to vWF and inhibit its interaction with collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, one embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct wherein at least one single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 8 to 12. Said sequences correspond to monospecific polypeptide constructs (such as in SEQ ID No. 8 and 11) or heterospecific polypeptide constructs comprising VHHs of different sequences (such as in SEQ ID No. 9, 10 and 12), both directed against vWF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention a polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against vWF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet aggregation is a very complex phenomenon and in an \nin vivo\n situation, the interaction of vWF with collagen only takes place at high shear as observed in small arteries. To assess platelet aggregation under high shear, the inventors performed perfusion experiments. Example 16 represents shear data obtained with the specific vWF-A3 binders SEQ ID No. 1 to 12. This experiment is representative for the interactions that take place upon damage of the vessel wall in a small artery (for example during angioplasty).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, monovalent VHH's perform very well in a platelet aggregation experiment under high shear: 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation was obtained at a concentration between 0.08 and 0.3 µg/ml. In comparison, the IgG vWF-specific antibody inhibiting the interaction with collagen, 82D6A3, inhibits 50% of platelet aggregation at approximately a twenty-fold higher concentration (\nVanhoorelbeke K. et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2003, 278: 37815-37821\n). These results were unexpected given that the IC50 values for the monovalent VHH's are up to 7 times fold worse in ELISA then the IC50 value of the IgG of 82D6A3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis clearly proves that the large size of said antibodies is not suited to interaction with macromolecules which are starting, or are in the process of aggregating, such as those involved in platelet-mediated aggregation. vWF forms multimers of up to 60 monomers (final multimers of up to 20 million dalton in size). Indeed, it has been shown that not all A3 domains are accessible to 82D6A3 (\nDongmei WU, Blood, 2002, 99, 3623 to 3628\n). Furthermore the large size of conventional antibodies, would restrict tissue penetration, for example, during platelet-mediated aggregation at the site of a damaged vessel wall. Nanobodies have a unique structure that consists of a single variable domain. VHH molecules derived from \nCamelidae\n antibodies are among the smallest intact antigen-binding domains known (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) and hence are well suited towards delivery to dense tissues and for accessing the limited space between macromolecules participating in or starting the process of platelet mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that experiments show, that the small size of a nanobody is advantagous over a large intact antibody for inhibition of interactions between such large macromolecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the small size of nanobodies, and thus advantages for penetration, it is still surprising that such a small molecule can inhibit interactions between large polymers such as vWF (up to 60 monomers) and collagen and with such a high efficiency. It has been described that only the large multimeric forms of vWF are hemostatically active (\nFurlan, M,. 1996, Ann. Hematol. 72:341-348\n). Binding of multimeric vWF to collagen occurs with ~100-fold higher affinity than binding of monomeric vWF fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from the high shear experiments indicate that a lower dose may be administered to patients. Therefore, fewer side effects are expected (such as immunogenicity or bleeding problems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that the polypeptides corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs 23 to 31 from single domain llama antibodies, bind to the A1 domain of vWF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies, wherein at least one single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 23 to 31.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 32 to 34. Said sequences correspond to bivalent polypeptide constructs comprising VHHs of the same sequences, both directed against vWF A1 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have performed perfusion experiment a flow chamber, to study the effect of polypeptide constructs comprising sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 23 to 31 upon platelet aggregation under high shear. Example 25 provides shear data obtained with the specific vWF-A1 binders SEQ ID No. 23 to 31\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that the polypeptides corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs 62 to 65 from single domain llama antibodies, bind selectively to the A1 domain of the active conformation of vWF (such as after being bound to collagen) rather than to freely circulating unactivated vWF. This results in antithrombotic agents that are both safer and more efficacious. As used herein, \"selective binding\" in reference to vWF A1 domains means that the llama antibodies have at least a tenfold and preferably a hundredfold greater affinity for the active conformation of vWF compared to the unactivated form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies, wherein at least one single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 62 to 65.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a polypeptide construct comprises one or more single domain antibodies directed to the same target, and further comprises one or more single domain antibodies directed to the same target but to a different epitope in the same domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 9, 10 and 12 are heterospecific polypeptide constructs comprising VHHs directed to different epitopes in the A3 domain of vWF. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 9, 10 and 12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct wherein the number of single domain antibodies directed to the same target is two or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 8 and 11 are polypeptide constructs comprising VHHs directed to the same epitopes in the A3 domain of vWF, wherein the both VHHs have identical sequences. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 8 and 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a polypeptide construct comprises one or more single domain antibodies directed to one domain of the same target, and one or more single domain antibodies directed to the same target but to another domain of the same target. Examples of different domains might be the A1 and A3 domains of vWF\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 20, 21 and 22 are heterospecific polypeptide constructs comprising VHHs directed to epitopes on different domains of vWF \ni.e\n. A1 and A3 of vWF. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 20, 21 and 22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is aspect of the invention that at least one VHH directed to the A1 domain in a heterospecific polypeptide construct recognizes the active conformation of vWF. Such a VHH corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 62 to 65.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch polypeptide constructs may have superior anti-thrombotic effects compared to the monomeric VHH's. Perfusion experiment were performed in a flow chamber, to study platelet aggregation under high shear to study the effects of these polypeptide constructs. Example 30 represents shear data obtained with the heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising anti vWF-A1 VHH and anti-vWF-A3 VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that the polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs 35 to 37 from single domain Ilama antibodies, bind to collagen type I and/or type III.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a polypeptide construct, wherein at least one single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 35 to 37.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a polypeptide construct comprises one or more single domain antibodies directed to the collagen I and/or type III, and one or more single domain antibodies directed to the same target but to a different epitope in the same domain. The sequences represented by 3P1-31_3P2-31 and 3L-41_3P2-31 are heterospecific polypeptide constructs comprising VHHs directed to different epitopes in collagen type I. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention a polypeptide construct corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 46 and 47.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed to the platelet glycoprotein Ib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA murine anti-human vWF monoclonal antibody, AJvW-2 (IgG), was developed that inhibited the interaction between platelet glycoprotein Ib (gpIb) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) during the ristocetin- and botrocetin- induced aggregation of human platelets (\n \nPCT application number WO 00/10601\n \n). AJvW-2 Fab, inhibits repetitive coronary artery thrombosis without bleeding time prolongation in dogs (\nKageyama S et al, Thromb Res., 2001 \n) and prevents thrombus deposition and neointima formation after balloon injury in guinea pigs (\nKageyama S, et al, Arterioscier Thromb Vasc Biol. 2000 Oct;20(10):2303-8\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody 6B4 is a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) raised against purified human gplb (PCT application number \n \nWO 01/10911 A2\n \n). When injected into baboons, intact IgG and its F(ab')2 fragments caused almost immediate thrombocytopenia, due to the bivalency of F(ab')2 which mediates platelet crosslinking, or Fc:Fc receptor interactions which mediate activation of platelet aggregation (\nCauwenberghs N. et al, Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular biology, 2000, 20: 1347\n and see, for example, \nCadroy Y et al, Blood, 1994, 83: 3218-3224\n, \nBecker BH et al, blood, 1989, 74: 690-694\n, \nRavanat C. et al, Thromb. Haemost. 1999 , 82 : 528a\n abstract). Platelet deposition onto collagen-rich bovine pericardium was inhibited when Fab fragments were injected into the baboons before a thrombus was generated. However, when the Fab fragments were injected after a thrombus was allowed to form, no inhibition of further thrombosis was observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was shown that the affinity of the Fab fragment for the gplb receptor on the platelet dropped by a factor of 10 as compared to the intact IgG or F(ab')2 (KD= 49.2 nM, 4.7 nM and 6.4 nM respectively). Also the IC50 value for ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation was up to 10-fold worse for Fab as compared to IgG or F(ab')2 (IC50 of 40 nM, 4.5 nM and 7.7 nM respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt might be expected that the undesirable thrombocytopenia caused by Fc:Fc receptor mediated activation of platelet aggregation and/or F(ab')2-mediated crosslinking of platelets which has been observed when using intact IgG or F(ab')2 therapeutically \nin vivo,\n will be avoided by the use of VHH, since VHH contains no Fc and it is not bivalent. No loss of affinity and activity will be obtained as observed with the Fab fragment of 6B4 as nanobodies are already single domain molecules.\n\n\n \n\n\nHumanised antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe discovery of naturally occurring single domain antibodies in llama, dromedary and camel revealed a new class of therapeutic molecules which combine the advantages of monoclonal antibodies for example specificity, low toxicity with the advantages of small molecules for example tissue penetration and stability. Unfortunately, the development of appropriate therapeutic products based on these proteins has the drawback of being \nCamelidae\n derived, and thus not human. Non-human proteins contain amino acid residues that can be immunogenic when injected into a human patient. Although studies have shown that \nCamelidae\n-derived VHH are not immunogenic when injected in mice, replacing \nCamelidae\n residues by human residues is preferable. These humanized polypeptides should be substantially non-immunogenic in humans, but retain the affinity and activity of the wild type polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy humanised is meant mutated so that immunogenicity upon administration in human patients is minor or nonexistent. Humanising a polypeptide, according to the present invention, comprises a step of replacing one or more of the \nCamelidae\n amino acids by their human counterpart as found in the human consensus sequence, without that polypeptide losing its typical character, \ni.e\n. the humanisation does not significantly affect the antigen binding capacity of the resulting polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have determined the amino acid residues of the antibody variable domain (VHH) which may be modified without diminishing the native affinity of the domain for antigen and while reducing its immunogenicity with respect to a heterologous species; the use of VHHs having modifications at the identified residues which are useful for administration to heterologous species; and to the VHH so modified. More specifically, the invention relates to the preparation of modified VHHs, which are modified for administration to humans, the resulting VHH themselves, and the use of such \"humanized\" VHHs in the treatment of diseases in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventor have also found that humanization of VHH polypeptides requires the introduction and mutagenesis of only a limited number of amino acids in a single polypeptide chain without dramatic loss of binding and/or inhibition activity. This is in contrast to Humanization of scFv, Fab, (Fab)2 and IgG, which requires the introduction of amino acid changes in two chains, the light and the heavy chain and the preservation of the assembly of both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA humanisation technique may be performed by a method comprising the replacement of any of the following residues either alone or in combination: FR1 positions 1, 5, 28 and 30, the hallmark amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 37, 44, 45 and 47 in FR2, FR3 residues 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94 and positions 103, 104, 108 and 111 in FR34 ; numbering according to the Kabat numbering. Examples of such humanized sequences are given in Table 30, SEQ ID No. 2, 38 to 41.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides represented in example 63 and 64 have a high degree of homology to human germline VH DP-47. Further humanization required the introduction and mutagenesis of a limited amount of amino acids in a single polypeptide chain. This is in contrast to humanization of scFv, Fab, (Fab)2 and IgG, which requires the introduction of amino acid changes in two chains, the light and the heavy chain and the preservation of the assembly of both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides contain human-like residues in FR2. Humanization required mutagenesis of residues in FR1 at \n \nposition\n \n 1 and 5 which were introduced by the primer used for repertoire cloning and do not occur naturally in the llama sequence. Mutagenesis of those residues did not result in loss of binding and/or inhibition activity. Humanization of FR1 also required mutagenesis of position 28 and 30. Mutagenesis of those residues also did not result in loss of binding and/or inhibition activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanization also required mutagenesis of residues in FR3 at position 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93, 94. Mutagenesis of those residues did not result in loss of binding and/or inhibition activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanization also required mutagenesis of residues in FR4 at position 104, 108 and 111. Mutagenesis of Q108L resulted in lower production level in Escherichia coli. Position 108 is solvent exposed in camelid VHH, while in human antibodies this position is buried at the VH-VL interface (Spinelli, 1996; Nieba, 1997). In isolated VHs position 108 is solvent exposed. The introduction of a non-polar hydrophobic Leu instead of polar uncharged Gin can have a drastic effect on the intrinsic foldability/stability of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a method for humanizing a VHH comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) replacing of any of the following residues either alone or in combination:\n\n \nFR1 positions 1, 5, 28 and 30,\n \nthe hallmark amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 37, 44, 45 and 47 in FR2,\n \nFR3 residues 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94 ,\n \nand positions 103, 104, 108 and 111 in FR4 ;\n \n \n \n\nnumbering according to the Kabat numbering.\n    \nExamples of such humanized sequences are given in Table 30, SEQ ID No. 2, 38 to 41.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of antibodies derived from sources such as mouse, sheep, goat, rabbit etc., and humanised derivatives thereof as a treatment for conditions which require a modulation of platelet-associated aggregation, is problematic for several reasons. Traditional antibodies are not stable at room temperature, and have to be refrigerated for preparation and storage, requiring necessary refrigerated laboratory equipment, storage and transport, which contribute towards time and expense. Refrigeration is sometimes not feasible in developing countries. The yields of expression of said Fab molecules are very low and the method of production is very labor intensive. Furthermore, the manufacture or small-scale production of said antibodies is expensive because the mammalian cellular systems necessary for the expression of intact and active antibodies require high levels of support in terms of time and equipment, and yields are very low. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon pH, and hence are unsuitable for use in environments outside the usual physiological pH range such as, for example, in treating gastric bleeding, gastric surgery. Furthermore, traditional antibodies are unstable at low or high pH and hence are not suitable for oral administration. However, it has been demonstrated that camelid antibodies resist harsh conditions, such as extreme pH, denaturing reagents and high temperatures (\nEwert S et al, Biochemistry 2002 Mar 19;41 (11):3628-36\n), so making them suitable for delivery by oral administration. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon temperature, and hence are unsuitable for use in assays or kits performed at temperatures outside biologically active-temperature ranges (\ne.g\n, 37 ± 20°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide constructs represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 47 and 49 to 65 and their derivatives not only possess the advantageous characteristics of conventional antibodies, such as low toxicity and high selectivity, but they also exhibit additional properties. They are more soluble, meaning they may be stored and/or administered in higher concentrations compared with conventional antibodies. They are stable at room temperature meaning they may be prepared, stored and/or transported without the use of refrigeration equipment, conveying a cost, time and environmental savings (described in example 61). Other advantageous characteristics as compared to conventional antibodies include short half-life in the circulation which may be modulated according to the invention by, for example, albumin-coupling, a bispecific nanobody with one specificity against albumin and the other against the target, Fc coupling, VHH coupling (bivalent VHHs) or by pegylation (described in example 41 until 54). A short and controllable half-life is desirable for surgical procedures, for example, which require an inhibition of platelet-mediated aggregation for a limited time period. Also, when bleeding problems occur or other complications, dosage can be lowered immediately. The polypeptides of the present invention also retain binding activity at a pH and temperature outside those of usual physiological ranges, which means they may be useful in situations of extreme pH and temperature which require a modulation of platelet-mediated aggregation, such as in gastric surgery, control of gastric bleeding, assays performed at room temperature etc. The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit a prolonged stability at extremes of pH, meaning they would be suitable for delivery by oral administration. The polypeptides of the present invention may be cost-effectively produced through fermentation in convenient recombinant host organisms such as \nEscherichia coli\n and yeast; unlike conventional antibodies which also require expensive mammalian cell culture facilities, achievable levels of expression are high. Examples of yields of the polypeptides of the present invention are 1 to 10 mg/ml (\nE. coli\n) and up to 1g/l (yeast). The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit high binding affinity for a broad range of different antigen types, and ability to bind to epitopes not recognised by conventional antibodies; for example they display long CDR-based loop structures with the potential to penetrate into cavities and exhibit enzyme function inhibition. Furthermore, since binding often occurs through the CDR3 loop only, it is envisaged that peptides derived from CDR3 could be used therapeutically (\nDesmyter et al., J Biol Chem, 2001, 276: 26285-90\n). The preparation of such peptide is described in Example 65. The polypeptides of the invention are also able to retain full binding capacity as fusion protein with an enzyme or toxin. Furthermore, it might be expected that the undesirable thrombocytopenia caused by Fc:Fc receptor mediated activation of platelet aggregation and/or F(ab')(2)-mediated crosslinking of platelets which has been observed when using intact IgG or F(ab')(2) therapeutically \nin vivo\n (see \nCauwenberghs N. et al, Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular biology, 2000, 20: 1347\n), will be avoided in the use of VHH, since VHH contains no Fc and it is not bivalent. Thus the polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 15, 20 to 47, 62 to 65, homologues or functional portions thereof provide a considerable cost and time saving in the treatment and diagnosis of conditions related to platelet-mediated aggregation, and the patient in need of said polypeptides would encounter fewer of the problems associated with conventional agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet-mediated aggregation is the process wherein vWF-bound collagen adheres to platelets and/or platelet receptors (examples of both are gpIa/IIa, gpIb, or collagen), ultimately resulting in platelet activation. Platelet activation leads to fibrinogen binding, and finally to platelet aggregation.

Conventional antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity, however, they have one important drawback: they are relatively unstable, and are sensitive to breakdown by proteases. This means that conventional antibody drugs cannot be administered orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation because they are not resistant to the low pH at these sites, the action of proteases at these sites and in the blood and/or because of their large size. They have to be administered by injection (intravenously, subcutaneously, etc.) to overcome some of these problems. Administration by injection requires specialist training in order to use a hypodermic syringe or needle correctly and safely. It further requires sterile equipment, a liquid formulation of the therapeutic polypeptide, vial packing of said polypeptide in a sterile and stable form and, of the subject, a suitable site for entry of the needle. Furthermore, subjects commonly experience physical and psychological stress prior to and upon receiving an injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the present invention overcomes these problems of the prior art, by providing the polypeptides constructs of the present invention. Said constructs are sufficiently small, resistant and stable to be delivered orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation substantial without loss of activity.

When identified in an assay that measures binding or said polypeptide displacement alone, agents will have to be subjected to functional testing to determine whether they act as modulators of platelet-mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an example of a displacement experiment, phage or cells expressing vWF or a fragment thereof are incubated in binding buffer with, for example, a polypeptide represented by-SEQ ID NO: 1 which has been labeled, in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a candidate modulator. To validate and calibrate the assay, control competition reactions using increasing concentrations of said polypeptide and which is unlabeled, can be performed. After incubation, cells are washed extensively, and bound, labelled polypeptide is measured as appropriate for the given label (\ne.g\n., scintillation counting, fluorescence, etc.). A decrease of at least 10% in the amount of labelled polypeptide bound in the presence of candidate modulator indicates displacement of binding by the candidate modulator, Candidate modulators are considered to bind specifically in this or other assays described herein if they displace 50% of labelled polypeptide (sub-saturating polypeptide dose) at a concentration of 1 µM or less. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 15, 20 to 47 and 62 to 65 or the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, binding or displacement of binding can be monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Surface plasmon resonance assays can be used as a quantitative method to measure binding between two molecules by the change in mass near an immobilized sensor caused by the binding or loss of binding of , for example, the polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO:1 from the aqueous phase to a vWF, or fragment thereof immobilized in a membrane on the sensor. This change in mass is measured as resonance units versus time after injection or removal of the said polypeptide or candidate modulator and is measured using a Biacore Biosensor (Biacore AB). vWF, or fragment thereof can be for example immobilized on a sensor chip (for example, research grade CM5 chip; Biacore AB) in a thin film lipid membrane according to methods described by Salamon et al. (\nSalamon et al., 1996, Biophys J. 71: 283-294\n; \nSalamon et al., 2001, Biophys. J. 80: 1557-1567\n; \nSalamon et al., 1999, Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 213-219\n, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.). Sarrio \net al.\n demonstrated that SPR can be used to detect ligand binding to the GPCR A(1) adenosine receptor immobilized in a lipid layer on the chip (\nSarrio et al., 2000, Mol. Cell. Biol. 20: 5164-5174\n, incorporated herein by reference). Conditions for the binding of a polypeptide construct of the invention in an SPR assay can be fine-tuned by one of skill in the art using the conditions reported by Sarrio \net al,\n as a starting point. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSPR can assay for modulators of binding in at least two ways. First, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, for example, can be pre-bound to immobilized vWF, or fragment thereof, followed by injection of candidate modulator at a concentration ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 µM. Displacement of the bound polypeptide can be quantitated, permitting detection of modulator binding. Alternatively, the membrane-bound vWF, or fragment thereof can be pre-incubated with a candidate modulator and challenged with, for example, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 1. A difference in binding affinity between said polypeptide and vWF, or fragment thereof pre-incubated with the modulator, compared with that between said polypeptide and vWF, or fragment thereof in absence of the modulator will demonstrate binding or displacement of said polypeptide in the presence of modulator. In either assay, a decrease of 10% or more in the amount of said polypeptide bound in the presence of candidate modulator, relative to the amount of said polypeptide bound in the absence of candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of vWF, or fragment thereof and said polypeptide. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 15, 20 to 47 and 62 to 65 or the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb, or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother method of detecting inhibition of binding of, for example, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45 or 62 to 65 to vWF, or fragments thereof uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs between a fluorescence donor (D) and a fluorescence acceptor (A) in close proximity to each other (usually < 100 Å of separation) if the emission spectrum of D overlaps with the excitation spectrum of A. The molecules to be tested, \ne.g\n. a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 and a vWF, or fragment thereof , are labelled with a complementary pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores. While bound closely together by the vWF : polypeptide interaction, the fluorescence emitted upon excitation of the donor fluorophore will have a different wavelength from that emitted in response to that excitation wavelength when the said polypeptide and vWF, or fragment thereof are not bound, providing for quantitation of bound versus unbound molecules by measurement of emission intensity at each wavelength. Donor fluorophores with which to label the vWF, or fragment thereof are well known in the art. Of particular interest are variants of the A. Victoria GFP known as Cyan FP (CFP, Donor (D)) and Yellow FP (YFP, Acceptor (A)). As an example, the YFP variant can be made as a fusion protein with vWF, or fragment thereof. Vectors for the expression of GFP variants as fusions (Clontech) as well as flurophore-labeled reagents (Molecular Probes) are known in the art. The addition of a candidate modulator to the mixture of fluorescently-labelled polypeptide and YFP-vWF will result in an inhibition of energy transfer evidenced by, for example, a decrease in YFP fluorescence relative to a sample without the candidate modulator. In an assay using FRET for the detection of vWF : polypeptide interaction, a 10% or greater decrease in the intensity of fluorescent emission at the acceptor wavelength in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to samples without the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the vWF:polypeptide interaction. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptides represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 15, 20 to 47, 62 to 65 or the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variation on FRET uses fluorescence quenching to monitor molecular interactions. One molecule in the interacting pair can be labeled with a fluorophore, and the other with a molecule that quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore when brought into close apposition with it. A change in fluorescence upon excitation is indicative of a change in the association of the molecules tagged with the fluorophore:quencher pair. Generally, an increase in fluorescence of the labeled vWF, or fragment thereof is indicative that the polypeptide molecule (\ne.g\n. a polypeptide construct of the invention) bearing the quencher has been displaced. For quenching assays, a 10% or greater increase in the intensity of fluorescent emission in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to samples without the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits vWF : polypeptide interaction. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the surface plasmon resonance and FRET methods, fluorescence polarization measurement is useful to quantitate binding. The fluorescence polarization value for a fluorescently-tagged molecule depends on the rotational correlation time or tumbling rate. Complexes, such as those formed by vWF, or fragment thereof associating with a fluorescently labelled polypeptide (\ne.g\n. a fluorescently-labeled polypeptide represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45 and 62 to 65), have higher polarization values than uncomplexed, labelled polypeptide. The inclusion of a candidate inhibitor of the vWF:polypeptide interaction results in a decrease in fluorescence polarization, relative to a mixture without the candidate inhibitor, if the candidate inhibitor disrupts or inhibits the interaction of vWF, or fragment thereof with said polypeptide. Fluorescence polarization is well suited for the identification of small molecules that disrupt the formation of vWF: polypeptide complexes. A decrease of 10% or more in fluorescence polarization in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to fluorescence polarization in a sample lacking the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the vWF: polypeptide interaction. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother alternative for monitoring vWF : polypeptide interactions uses a biosensor assay. ICS biosensors have been described in the art (Australian Membrane Biotechnology Research Institute; \nCornell B, Braach-Maksvytis V, King L, Osman P, Raguse B, Wieczorek L, and Pace R. \"\nA biosensor that uses ion-channel switches\n\" Nature 1997, 387, 580\n). In this technology, the association of vWF, or fragment thereof and a polypeptide (e.g. a polypeptide represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45 and 62 to 65) is coupled to the closing of gramacidin-facilitated ion channels in suspended membrane bilayers and thus to a measurable change in the admittance (similar to impedence) of the biosensor. This approach is linear over six orders of magnitude of admittance change and is ideally suited for large scale, high throughput screening of small molecule combinatorial libraries. A 10% or greater change (increase or decrease) in admittance in a sample containing a candidate modulator, relative to the admittance of a sample lacking the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of vWF, or fragment thereof and said polypeptide. It is important to note that in assays testing the interaction of vWF, or fragment thereof with a polypeptide (such as for example, a polypeptide represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45 and 62 to 65), it is possible that a modulator of the interaction need not necessarily interact directly with the domain(s) of the proteins that physically interact with said polypeptide. It is also possible that a modulator will interact at a location removed from the site of interaction and cause, for example, a conformational change in the vWF. Modulators (inhibitors or agonists) that act in this manner are nonetheless of interest as agents to modulate platelet-mediated aggregation. Of course, the above method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the binding assays described can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample, e.g., a tissue sample, that binds to vWF, or fragment thereof, or that affects the binding of, for example, a polypeptide represented by any of SEQ ID NO:1 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45 or 62 to 65 to the vWF. To do so a vWF, or fragment thereof is reacted with said polypeptide in the presence or absence of the sample, and polypeptide binding is measured as appropriate for the binding assay being used. A decrease of 10% or more in the binding of said polypeptide indicates that the sample contains an agent that modulates the binding of said polypeptide to the vWF, or fragment thereof. Of course, the above generalised method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, and macromolecules involved in platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF, gplb or collagen, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\nCells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA cell that is useful according to the invention is preferably selected from the group consisting of bacterial cells such as, for example, \nE\n. \ncoli,\n yeast cells such as, for example, \nS. cerevisiae, P. pastoris,\n insect cells or mammalian cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cell that is useful according to the invention can be any cell into which a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide comprising any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 47 and 49 to 65 or a polypeptide construct of the invention according to the invention can be introduced such that the polypeptide is expressed at natural levels or above natural levels, as defined herein. Preferably a polypeptide of the invention that is expressed in a cell exhibits normal or near normal pharmacology, as defined herein. Most preferably a polypeptide of the invention that is expressed in a cell comprises the nucleotide sequence capable of encoding the amino acid sequences presented in Table 30 or capable of encoding a amino acid sequence that is at least 70% identical to the amino acid sequence presented in Table 30.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a cell is selected from the group consisting of COS7-cells, a CHO cell, a LM (TK-) cell, a NIH-3T3 cell, HEK-293 cell, K-562 cell or a 1321 N1 astrocytoma cell but also other transfectable cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, \"therapeutically effective amount\", \"therapeutically effective dose\" and \"effective amount\" means the amount needed to achieve the desired result or results (treating or preventing platelet aggregation). One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the potency and, therefore, an \"effective amount\" can vary for the various compounds that inhibit platelet-mediated aggregation used in the invention. One skilled in the art can readily assess the potency of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"compound\" refers the polypeptide constructs disclosed herein, or to a nucleic acid capable of encoding said polypeptide, or an agent identified according to the screening method described herein or said polypeptide comprising one or more derivatised amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is meant a materials that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, \ni.e.,\n the material may be administered to an individual along with the compound without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is useful for treating or preventing a condition of platelet-mediated aggregation, in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition that inhibits BTK and that inhibits platelet-mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is useful for treating or preventing the first steps of thrombus formation, in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is useful for treating or preventing restenosis, in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is the use of compounds of the invention for treating or preventing a condition of platelet-mediated aggregation, in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound in combination with another, such as, for example, aspirin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is the use of compounds of the invention for treating or preventing a condition of platelet-mediated aggregation, in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound in combination with another, such as, for example, a thrombolytic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention is a use of a compound of the invention for treating or preventing plaque or thrombus in an individual. Said plaque or thrombus formation may be under conditions of high sheer. In both thrombosis and reocclusion, the reversible adhesion or tethering of the platelets at high shear rate is followed by a firm adhesion through the collagen receptor on platelets resulting in platelet activation; the tethering of platelets by vWF to collagen exposed in the damaged vessel wall is especially important under high shear conditions. The inventors have found that polypeptide constructs of the present invention unexpected performed well under high sheer conditions (\ne.g\n. Example 16.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not limited to the administration of formulations comprising a single compound of the invention. It is within the scope of the invention to provide combination treatments wherein a formulation is administered to a patient in need thereof that comprises more than one compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditions of platelet-mediated aggregation include, but are not limited to, unstable angina, stable angina, angina pectoris, embolus formation, deep vain thrombosis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, thrombolytic complications, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular comgelopathy, thrombosis, coronary heart disease, thromboembolic complications, myocardial infarction, restenosis, and atrial thrombosis formation in atrial fibrillation, chronic unstable angina, transient ischemic attacks and strokes, peripheral vascular disease, arterial thrombosis, pre-eclampsia, embolism, restenosis and/or thrombosis following angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy, anastomosis of vascular grafts, and chronic exposure to cardiovascular devices. Such conditions may also result from thromboembolism and reocculsion during and after thrombolytic therapy, after angioplasty, and after coronary artery bypass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art how to determine the inhibition of platelet-mediated aggregation using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests. Preferably, the method would result in at least a 10% reduction in platelet-mediated aggregation, including, for example, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%,60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or any amount in between, more preferably by 90%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, the method would result in at least a 10% reduction in intracellular calcium mobilization including, for example, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%. 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Similarly, the method would result in at least a 10% reduction in the level of phosphorylated \nPLCg\n 2 including, for example, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reduction can be measured, for example, by comparing the optical impedence in a chronology platelet aggregometer. Any other known measurement method may also be used. For example, (1) upon collagen stimulation, the level of collagen-induced intracellular calcium mobilization increases over time and so the measurement may include measuring the level of collagen-induced intracellular calcium or (2) upon collagen stimulation, the level of phosphorylated \nPLCg\n 2 increases over time and so the measurement may include measuring the level of phosphorylated \nPLCg\n 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells can be contacted in vitro, for example, by adding a compound of the invention to the culture medium (by continuous infusion, by bolus delivery, or by changing the medium to a medium that contains the compound) or by adding the compound to the extracellular fluid \nin vivo\n (by local delivery, systemic delivery, inhalation, intravenous injection, bolus delivery, or continuous infusion). The duration of \"contact\" with a cell or population of cells is determined by the time the compound is present at physiologically effective levels or at presumed physiologically effective levels in the medium or extracellular fluid bathing the cell or cells. Preferably, the duration of contact is 1-96 hours, and more preferably, for 24 hours, but such time would vary based on the half life of the compound and could be optimized by one skilled in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound useful in the present invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient or a domestic animal in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, \ni.e\n., orally or parenterally, by intra-nasally by inhalation, intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See, \ne.g\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,399,346\n \n, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery, primary cells transfected with the gene for the compound of the present invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs, tissue, grafts, tumors, or cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present compound may be systemically administered, \ne.g\n., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the present compound may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, hydroxyalkyis or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compound can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compound to the skin are known to the art; for example, see \n \nJacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392\n \n), \n \nGeria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478\n \n), \n \nSmith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157\n \n) and \n \nWortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the compound can be determined by comparing their \nin vitro\n activity, and \nin vivo\n activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the compound(s) in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semisolid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the compound varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, \ne.g\n., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By \"long-term\" is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E.W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA\n. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides for an agent that is a modulator of platelet-mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe candidate agent may be a synthetic agent, or a mixture of agents, or may be a natural product (\ne.g\n. a plant extract or culture supernatant). A candidate agent according to the invention includes a small molecule that can be synthesized, a natural extract, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidate modulator agents from large libraries of synthetic or natural agents can be screened. Numerous means are currently used for random and directed synthesis of saccharide, peptide, and nucleic acid based agents. Synthetic agent libraries are commercially available from a number of companies including Maybridge Chemical Co. (Trevillet, Cornwall, UK), Comgenex (Princeton, NJ), Brandon Associates (Merrimack, NH), and Microsource (New Milford, CT). A rare chemical library is available from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Combinatorial libraries are available and can be prepared. Alternatively, libraries of natural agents in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available from e.g., Pan Laboratories (Bothell, WA) or MycoSearch (NC), or are readily producible by methods well known in the art. Additionally, natural and synthetically produced libraries and agents are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical, and biochemical means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful agents may be found within numerous chemical classes. Useful agents may be organic agents, or small organic agents. Small organic agents have a molecular weight of more than 50 yet less than about 2,500 daltons, preferably less than about 750, more preferably less than about 350 daltons. Exemplary classes include heterocycles, peptides, saccharides, steroids, and the like. The agents may be modified to enhance efficacy, stability, pharmaceutical compatibility, and the like. Structural identification of an agent may be used to identify, generate, or screen additional agents. For example, where peptide agents are identified, they may be modified in a variety of ways to enhance their stability, such as using an unnatural amino acid, such as a D-amino acid, particularly D-alanine, by functionalizing the amino or carboxylic terminus, e.g. for the amino group, acylation or alkylation, and for the carboxyl group, esterification or amidification, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor primary screening, a useful concentration of a candidate agent according to the invention is from about 10 mM to about 100 µM or more (i.e. 1 mM, 10 µM, 100 mM, 1 M etc.). The primary screening concentration will be used as an upper limit, along with nine additional concentrations, wherein the additional concentrations are determined by reducing the primary screening concentration at half-log intervals (e.g. for 9 more concentrations) for secondary screens or for generating concentration curves.\n\n\n \n\n\nHigh throughout screening kit\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA high throughput screening kit according to the invention comprises all the necessary means and media for performing the detection of an agent that modulates platelet-mediated aggregation by interacting with a target of the invention, such as for example vWF, or fragment thereof in the presence of a polypeptide (for example, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NOs; 1 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45, 62 to 65 or a polypeptide construct), preferably at a concentration in the range of 1µM to 1 mM. The kit comprises the following. Recombinant cells of the invention, comprising and expressing the nucleotide sequence encoding vWF, or fragment thereof, which are grown according to the kit on a solid support, such as a microtiter plate, more preferably a 96 well microtiter plate, according to methods well known to the person skilled in the art especially as described in \n \nWO 00/02045\n \n. Alternatively vWF, or fragment thereof is supplied in a purified form to be immobilized on, for example, a 96 well microtiter plate by the person skilled in the art. Alternatively vWF, or fragment thereof is supplied in the kit pre-immobilized on, for example, a 96 well microtiter plate. Alternatively, in cases where the macromolecule to be screened against is gpIb, gpIa/IIa, or collagen, the above embodiments would carry gplb, gpIa/IIa, or collagen polypeptide or polynucleic acid respectively in place of vWF. Kit may contain more than one macromolecule (e.g. vWF, gpfb or collagen macromolecule and/or polynucleic acid). Modulator agents according to the invention, at concentrations from about 1 µM to 1 mM or more, are added to defined wells in the presence of an appropriate concentration of polypeptide construct said concentration of said polypeptide preferably in the range of 1 µM to 1 mM. Kits may contain more than one polypeptide\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding assays are performed as according to the methods already disclosed herein and the results are compared to the baseline level of, for example vWF, or fragment thereof binding to a polypeptide, such as, for example, a polypeptide represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 15, 20 to 34, 38 to 45 or 62 to 65, but in the absence of added modulator agent. Wells showing at least 2 fold, preferably 5 fold, more preferably 10 fold and most preferably a 100 fold or more increase or decrease in vWF-polypeptide binding (for example) as compared to the level of activity in the absence of modulator, are selected for further analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Kits Useful According to the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides for kits useful for screening for modulators of platelet-mediated aggregation, as well as kits useful for diagnosis of diseases or disorders characterised by dysregulation platelet-mediated aggregation. Kits useful according to the invention can includes an isolated vWF, or fragment thereof. Alternatively, or in addition, a kit can comprise cells transformed to express vWF, or fragment thereof. In a further embodiment, a kit according to the invention can comprise a polynucleotide encoding vWF, or fragment thereof. In a still further embodiment, a kit according to the invention may comprise the specific primers useful for amplification of vWF, or fragment thereof. Alternatively, in cases where the macromolecule to be screened against is gplb, or collagen, the above embodiments would carry gplb, gpla/IIa, or collagen polypeptide or polynucleic acid, or fragment thereof respectively in place of vWF.

All kits according to the invention will comprise the stated items or combinations of items and packaging materials therefore. Kits will also include instructions for use.\n\n\n \n\n\nMedical devices\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides for invasive medical devices coated with a polypeptide construct of the invention or an agent resulting from a screening method of the invention for use in devices requiring the same.

The immunization scheme is summarized in Table 1\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Repertoire cloning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated by centrifugation on a density gradient (Ficoll-Paque Plus Amersham Biosciences). PBLs were used to extract total RNA (Chamczynski and Sacchi 1987). cDNA was prepared on 100 µg total RNA with MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco BRL) using oligo d(T) oligonucleotides. The cDNA was purified with a phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by an ethanol precipitation and subsequently used as template to amplify the VHH repertoire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first PCR, the repertoire of both conventional (1.6 kb) and heavy-chain (1.3 kb) antibody gene segments were amplified using a leader specific primer (5' - GGCTGAGCTCGGTGGTCCTGGCT- 3') and the oligo d(T) primer (5'-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'). The resulting DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the 1.3 kb fragment, encoding heavy-chain antibody segments was purified from the agarose gel. A second PCR was performed using a mixture of FR1 reverse primers and the same oligo d(T) forward primer. The PCR products were digested with \nSfil\n (introduced in the FR1 primer) and \nBstE\nll (naturally occurring in FR4). Following gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment of approximately 400 basepairs were purified from gel and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of phagemid pAX004 to obtain a library of cloned VHHs after electroporation of \nEscherichia coli\n TG1. The size of the library was 1.4 x 10\n7\n cfu, and all clones contained insert of the correct size.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples 3: Rescue of the library, phage preparation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe library was grown at 37°C in 10 ml 2xTY medium containing 2% glucose, and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, until the OD600nm reached 0.5. M13KO7 phages (10\n12\n) were added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 x 30 minutes, first without shaking, then with shaking at 100 rpm. Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 2xTY medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin, and incubated overnight at 37°C with vigorously shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight cultures were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10000 rpm at 4°C. Phages were PEG precipitated (20% poly-ethylene-glycol and 1.5 M NaCl) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml PBS. Phages were again PEG precipitated and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20000 rpm and 4°C. The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml PBS-1% casein. Phages were titrated by infection of TG1 cells at OD600nm= 0.5 and plating on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. The number of transformants indicates the number of phages (= pfu). The phages were stored at -80°C with 15% glycerol.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSelection for binders for vWF inhibiting the interactions with collagen (Figure 2)\n Examples 4: Selection for binders for vWF inhibiting the interaction with collagen: first and second round of panning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 2 µg/ml vWF or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at RT. 200 µl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10x with PBS-Tween and 10x with PBS, Phages were specifically eluted with 100 µl of 100 µg/ml collagen type III. Elutions were performed for overnight at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. This experiment was repeated for a second round of panning, under the same conditions as described above. The results from the panning are presented in Table 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples 5: Functional characterization of vWF binders: inhibition of binding of vWF to collagen by VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4°C with collagen type III at 25 µg/ml in PBS. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with PBS containing 1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. 100 µl of 2 µg/ml vWF (vWF is pre-incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes) was mixed with 20 µl periplasmic extract containing a VHH antibody (described in Example 6) and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature in the wells of the microtiterplate. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. An anti-vWF-HRP monoclonal antibody (DAKO) was diluted 3,000-fold in PBS and incubated for 1 hour. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and vWF-binding was detected with ABTSS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The results are presented in Table 3, showing that inhibitors are obtained after the first and second round of panning.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6: Expression and purification of VHH)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid was prepared for binders for vWF inhibiting the interaction with collagen typelll and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 ml TB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C or overnight at 28°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at -20°C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 20000 rpm. The supernatant containing the VHH was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity. The yield of VHH was calculated according to the extinction coefficient. Results are summarized in Table 4.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples 7: ELISA: binding to vWF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 2 µg/ml vWF, overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Dilution series of all purified samples were incubated for 2 hours at RT. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of VHH was detected by incubation with \nmouse anti-myc mAB\n 1/2000 in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nHRP conjugate\n 1/1000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The binding as a function of concentration of purified VHH is indicated in \nFigure 3\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8: Specificity of the VHHs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMicrotiterplates were coated with 2 µg/ml vWF and 3 other antigens not involved in platelet aggregation, but that were also immunized in llama 002. ELISA was performed as described in Example 7 with 670, 67 and 6.7 nM VHH. Results are summarized in Table 5. The results show that the inhibitory VHH are specific for vWF.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9: Inhibition ELISA with purified VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition ELISA was performed as described in Example 5 but with decreasing concentrations of VHH and with human plasma at a dilution of 1/60 instead of with purified vWF or with human undiluted plasma. Results are represented in \nfigure 4\n. The concentration of VHH resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) is given in Table 6.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples 10: Sequencing of the clones\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nClones were sequenced with M13 universal reverse primer.

The gene coding for the A3 domain of vWF (201aa) was amplified by PCR using the A3for and A3back PCR primers.\n\n \n \n \nA3for: CTG GTG CTG CAG AGG TGA AGC TTC GGA GAG GGG CTG CAG ATC\n \nA3back: ATC CAT GCA AAT CCT CTA GAA TCC AGA GCA CAG TTT GTG GAG\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFragment and vector were digested with HindIII and Xbal, ligated and transformed in UT5600 (= pBAD-vWFA1/pBAD-vWFA3). Transformed cells were plated on LB agar plates containing 20 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml spectinomycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pBAD-vWFA3 plasmid was transformed in UT5600 F- cells and plated on LB agar plates with 20 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml spectinomycin. A single colony was used to inoculate LB medium with 20 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml spectinomycin. Cells were grown overnight at 37°C at 200 rpm. The next day, cells were induced with 0.2% arabinose and incubated for 1 more hour at 37°C at 150 rpm. Total cell lysates were boiled in reducing sample buffer, loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Transferred proteins were detected using a monoclonal anti-Opri antibody (SH2.2) (\nCote-Sierra et al, 1998, Gene, 221: 25-34\n). An anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was applied (Sigma), and the blots were developed with BCIP/NBT (\nFigure 5\n). The pBAD-vWF-A3 plasmids were transformed in UT5600 F- cells and plated on LB agar plates with 20 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml spectinomycin. A single colony was used to inoculate LB medium with 20 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml spectinomycin. Cells were grown overnight at 37°C at 200 rpm. The next day, cells were induced with 0.2% arabinose and incubated for 1 more hour at 37°C at 150 rpm. A microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4°C with the monoclonal anti-Oprl antibody (SH2.2) diluted 1/1000 in PBS and blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS containing 1% casein. After induction, total cells were allowed to bind to the plate for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Phage preparations of single colonies were allowed to bind for two hours at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. An anti-M13 HRP conjugate was used for detection of phage binding to \nE\n. \ncoli\n cells expressing the A3 domain or to an irrelevant antigen on their surface. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n and signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are summarized in Table 7.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples 12: Bivalent and bispecific VHHs: expression and purification\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe \nE. coli\n production vector pAX11 was designed (\nFigure 6\n), which allows the two-step cloning of bivalent or bispecific VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carboxy terminal VHH is cloned first with PstI and BstElI, while in the second step the other VHH is inserted by SfiI and NotI, which do not cut within the first gene fragment. The procedure avoids the enforcement of new sites by amplification and thus the risk of introducing PCR errors. The sequence is shown in Table 30 (\nSEQ ID numbers\n 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein was expressed and purified as described in Example 6. An extra purification step was needed on superdex 75 for removal of some monovalent degradation product (5-10%). Yields obtained for 1 liter expression and purification of bivalent protein in \nE\n. \ncoli\n are summarized in Table 8.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 13: Binding in ELISA to vWF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding to vWF was tested in ELISA as described in Example 7 and compared to binding of monovalent VHH. The results are shown in \nFigure 7\n. It is clear from the results that bivalent and bispecific VHH show stronger binding to VWF when compared to monovalent VHH.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 14: Inhibition ELISA with purified VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition for binding of vWF to collagen was tested for monovalent as compared to bivalent VHHs as described in Example 5. Instead of using purified vWF, human, baboon and pig plasma was used in parallel at a dilution of 1/60. IC50 values are summarized in Table 9.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 15: Stability of bivalent or bispecific constructs in human plasma\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStability of bivalent constructs was tested by incubation at 37°C in human plasma. AM-4-15-3/AM2-75 was incubated in human plasma at a concentration of 38 µg/ml at 37°C. A sample was removed after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 hours incubation. Samples were diluted 10-fold and analyzed by Western blot. Results are summarized in \nFigure 8\n and show that the bivalent construct is stable for at least 24 hours at 37°C in human plasma.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples 16: Evaluation of inhibition by VHH at high shear.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGlass coverslips (18x18 mm, Menzel Gläser) were cleaned overnight by a chromosulfuric acid (2% chromium trioxide) solution and rinsed with distilled water before spraying. Monomeric collagen type III was solubilized in 50 mmol/L acetic acid and sprayed with a density of 30 µg/cm\n2\n on glass coverslips with a retouching airbrush (\nBadger model\n 100, Badger Brush Co). After the spraying procedure, the collagen surface was blocked for 1 hour with 1% human albumin in PBS (10 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.15 mol/L NaCl) to prevent nonspecific protein binding during the subsequent perfusion. Perfusion studies over collagen type III were carried out in a specially devised small parallel-plate perfusion chamber with well-defined rheological characteristics accommodating a glass coverslip. Whole blood was obtained by venipuncture from volunteers. Blood was drawn through the perfusion chamber by a Harvard infusion pump (pump 22, model 2400-004; Harvard, Natick, MA). The perfusion time was 5 minutes. Triplicate coverslips were inserted in the chamber. Five milliliters of whole blood was pre-warmed at 37°C for 5 minutes with or without addition of VHH, and then recirculated through the chamber for 5 minutes at a wall shear rate of 300 s\n-1\n or 1600 s\n-1\n. The coverslips were removed, rinsed , fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated with methanol, and stained with May-Grünwald/Giemsa. Platelet adhesion was quantitated with a light microscope (1,000x magnification) connected to a computerized image analyzer (AMS 40-10, Saffron Walden, UK). Platelet adhesion was expressed as the percentage of the surface covered with platelets. Results are summarized in Table 10 and 11.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSelection of binders for vWF inhibiting the interaction with platelets (figure 9).\n Example 17: Selection of binders for vWF inhibiting the interaction with platelets: panning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nImmunotubes were coated with 2 µg/ml vWF or with PBS containing 1% casein.

Results were compared to VHH stored at -20°C and are presented in \nFigure 24\n. Shown for comparison are the activities of a scFv against B3 antigen (\nReiter et al, Protein Engineering, 1994, 7: 697-704\n), and said scFv modified by the introduction of a disulphide bond between framework residues 44 and 105 to enhance its stability (dsFv). The dsFv lost 40% of its activity after 60 hours incubation at 37°C. After one year of incubation at 37°C, C37 was analyzed for its inhibitory properties as compared to C37 stored in the freezer. The ELISA was performed as described in Example 5 with human plasma at a final dilution of 1/200. The results are shown in \nFigure 25\n and indicate that functionality is fully retained (IC50 value of 0.085 versus 0.1 µg/ml for C37 stored at 37°C versus -20°C). Therefore, it is expected that VHH will have a long shelf-life.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 62: VHH immobilized in a polymer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA mixture was prepared of 0.5 ml of 30% acrylamide; 1 ml of 1M Tris pH= 7.5; 3.5 ml H2O; 35 µl of 10% APS; 3.5 µl TEMED. In some wells, VHH C37 was added at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. The mixture was allowed to polymerize in the wells of a 96-well plate for 3 hours at RT. Human plasma was added at different dilutions starting with undiluted plasma. After 1 hour incubation at RT, the plate was washed and anti-vWF-HRP (DAKO) was added at 1/2000, for 1 hour at RT. After washing the plate, substrate (ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n) was added and OD405nm was measured. The result is shown in \nFigure 26\n. The results indicate that VHH remain functional upon immobilization in a polymer.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHumanisation of C37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 63: Alignment of C37 with DP-47\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlignment of the C37 nanobody (SEQ ID number 1) and a human VH3 germline (DP-47) revealed a high degree of homology:\n\n \n \n \n○ 4 AA changes in FR1 on \n \nposition\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30\n \n○ 4 AA changes in FR3 on position 74, 75, 84 and 94\n \n○ 3 AA changes in FR4 on position 104, 108 and 111\n \n\nas is shown in \nFigure 27\n\n\n\n\nExample 64: Mutagenesis of C37\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nC37 was mutated by using a non-PCR based site-directed mutagenesis method as described by Chen and Ruffner (\nChen and Ruffner, Amplification of closed circular DNA in vitro, Nucleic Acids Research, 1998, 1126-1127\n) and commercialized by Stratagene (Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasmid DNA was used as template in combination with 2 mutagenic primers (table 29) introducing the desired mutation(s). The 2 primers are each complementary to opposite strands of the template plasmid DNA. In a polymerase reaction using the \nPfu\n DNA polymerase each strand is extended from the primer sequence during a cycling program using a limited amount of cycles. This results in a mixture of wild type and mutated strands. Digestion with \nDpnl\n results in selection of mutated \nin vitro\n synthesized DNA. The DNA was precipitated and transformed to \nE\n. \ncoli\n and analyzed for the required mutation by sequence analysis. The clone with the correct sequence was named C37-hum, the amino acid sequence is in Table 30 \nSEQ ID number\n 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and purification of C37-hum was performed as described in Example 6. inhibition of binding of vWF to collagen for C37 was compared to C37-hum as described in Example 5. Results are shown in \nFigure 28\n. It clearly shows that the humanized version of C37 remains fully functional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe positions that still need to be humanized are: Q1, Q5, D104, Q198 and I111. We can humanize \n \nposition\n \n 1 and 5 without loss of inhibition since these amino acids were introduced by the FR1 primer and do not occur naturally in the Ilama sequence. We can also humanize position 111 since we isolated a VHH identical to C37 except for I111V (AM-2-75 SEQ ID number 3) with the same functional characteristics (Example 9 and Table 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosition 108 is solvent exposed in camelid VHH, while in human antibodies this position is buried at the VH-VL interface (Spinelli, 1996; Nieba, 1997). In isolated VHs position 108 is solvent exposed. The introduction of a non-polar hydrophobic Leu instead of polar uncharged Gin can have a drastic effect on the intrinsic foldability/stability of the molecule.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFragments of antiVWF VHHs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 65: Expression of a VHH-CDR3 fragment of vWF-C37\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CDR3 region of C37 was amplified by using a sense primer located in the framework 4 region (Forward: CCCCTGGTCCCAGTTCCCTC) and an anti-sense primer located in the \nframework\n 3 region (Reverse: TGTGCTCGCGGGGCCGGTAC),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to clone the CDR-3 fragment in pAX10, a second round PCR amplification was performed with following primers introducing the required restriction sites:\n\n \n \n \nReverse primer Sfi1: GTCCTCGCAACTGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCTGTGCTCGCGGGGCCGGTAC\n \nForward primer Not1: GTCCTCGCAACTGCGCGGCCGCCCCCTGGTCCCAGTTCCCTC\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe PCR reactions were performed in 50 ml reaction volume using 50pmol of each primer. The reaction conditions for the primary PCR were 11 min at 94°C, followed by 30/60/120 sec at 94/55/72 °C for 30 cycles, and 5 min at 72°C. All reaction were performed wit 2.5 mM MgCl2 , 200 mM dNTP and 1.25U AmpliTaq God DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter cleavage with Sfi1 and Not1 the PCR product was cloned in pAX10,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIsolation of conformation-specific anti-vWF VHH's\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 66: Selection via first and second round biopanning on recombinant A1 (rA1)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiter plate was coated with 5 µg/ml recombinant A1 domain of vWF (rA1), or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at RT. 200 µl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10x with PBS-Tween and 10x with PBS. Bound phages were eluted with 100 µl 0.2 M glycin buffer, pH 2.4. Elutions were performed for 20 minutes at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing \nE\n. \ncoli\n TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. A second round was performed with the same conditions as described above but phages were re-suspended in 10 µg/ml vWF. The wells of the microtiterplate were washed 7 times for 30 minutes with 10 µg/ml vWF. Results are summarized in Table 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 67: Screening of individual clones after biopanning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELISA: binding to rA1 and vWF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in TB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C or overnight at 28°C. Cultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at -20°C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 20.000 rpm. The supernatant containing the VHH was used for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 2 µg/ml rA1 or with 1 µg/ml vWF, overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1 % casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Periplasmic fraction was prepared for 192 individual clones after the second round of selection, and allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiter plate. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of nanobody was detected by incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-nanobody (1/2000 dilution) in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by goat anti-rabbit-\nHRP conjugate\n 1/2000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate ABTS/H2O2 and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are summarized in Table 32. We can conclude that 50 clones bind to rA1 and not to vWF.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 68: Hinfl pattern and sequencing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA PCR was performed on positive clones for rA1 and negative for vWF, after the second round of panning, with a set of primers binding to a sequence in the vector. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme Hinfl and loaded on a agarose gel. 30 clones were selected with a different Hinfl-pattern for further evaluation. Those clones were tested in more detail by ELISA as described in example 67. Out of the 30 clones, 4 were shown to clearly have a much higher affinity for rA1 than for vWF. The data are shown in \nFigures 29\n (binding to rA1) and 30 (binding to vWF). These clones were sequenced, and results are summarized in Table 30 (SEQ ID numbers 62 to 65).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 69: Inhibition ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \ninhibition by nanobodies for binding of vWF to gpIb was determined by ELISA. A microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4°C with an antibody specific for platelet receptor gplb at 5µg/ml in PBS. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween, and blocked with 300 µl PBS-1% casein for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween. Plasma was applied to the wells of the microliter plate at a ½ dilution and allowed to bind for 1.5 hours at 37C. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween. VHH was added at decreasing concentration. Plasma containing vWF was pre-incubated at a dilution of 1/50 at 37°C for 5 minutes. Ristocetin was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and added to the VHH. This mixture was incubated for 1 hour 37C. 50 µl of this mixture was then applied to a microtiter plate well and incubated for 90 minutes at 37C. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween.

They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTMl) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPCl (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPVl, TRPV2, TRPV3 or TRPV4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRP V3 and is more closely related to TRPVl and TRPV2 than to TRP V5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPMl (melastatin or LTRPCl), TRPM3 (KIAAl 616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMRl), TRPM5 (MTRl or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPMLl (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPPl (PKDl, PCl), PKD-REJ and PKD-ILl are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTMl. \n\n It is believed TRPAl is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPAl is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice.TRPAl is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson, L. J. et al., Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAl ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAl receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAl is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals\n\n\nThe difference between TRPAl and other TRP receptors is that TRPAl ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required.\n\n\nWO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions.\n\n\nIn efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPAl.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein,\n\n\nR\n1\n and R\n2\n, which may be the same or different, are independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, (CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\nOR\nx\n, COR\nX\n, COOR\nX\n, CONR\nx\nR\ny\n, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nNR\nx\nR\ny\n, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCHR\nx\nR\ny\n, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nNR\nx\nR\ny\n and (CH\n2\n)\nn\nNHCOR\nx\n;\n\n\nR\n3\n is selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl and cycloalkenyl;\n\n\nZi and Z\n2\n are independently oxygen or CR\na\n;

For instance, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are suitable for treatment or prophylaxis of the following diseases, conditions and disorders mediated or associated with the activity of TRPAl receptors: pain, chronic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid \n\n arthritic pain, osteoarthritic pain, back pain, visceral pain, cancer pain, algesia, neuralgia, migraine, neuropathies, chemotherapy - induced neuropathies, eye - irritation, bronchial - irritation, skin - irritation (atopic dermatitis), Frost - bites (cold - bite), spasticity, catatonia, catalepsy, parkinsons, diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, HIV-related neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration, stroke, post stroke pain, multiple sclerosis, respiratory diseases, asthma, cough, COPD, inflammatory disorders, oesophagitis, gastroeosophagal reflux disorder (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic hypersensitivity, urinary incontinence, cystitis, burns, psoriasis, eczema, emesis, stomach duodenal ulcer and pruritus. The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPAl is illustrated, for example, in Story, G. M. et al. Cell, 2003, 112, 819-829; McMahon, S.B. and Wood, J. N., Cell, 2006, 124, 1123-1125; Voorhoeve, P. M. et al. Cell, 2006, 124, 1169-1181; Wissenbach, U, Niemeyer, B. A. and Flockerzi, V. Biology of the Cell, 2004, 96, 47-54; and the references cited therein.\n\n\nPain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett & F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed., 1996, 100-107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as \"nociceptors\". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and Aδ fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal and proton (pH<6) modalities. Nociceptors are the nerves which sense and respond to parts of the body which suffer from damage. They signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain.\n\n\nChronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually \n\n time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited).\n\n\nGeneral Methods of Preparation\n\n\nThe compounds of the general formula (I), (Ia), (Ib) and (Ic) and specific examples to demonstrate embodiments of the invention can be prepared by methods described below in Schemes 1-8. However, those skilled in the art should, in light of the methods described herein, can prepare these compounds through similar approaches without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, in the following synthetic schemes, where specific acids, bases, reagents, coupling agents, solvents, etc. are mentioned, it is understood that other suitable acids, bases, reagents, coupling agents etc. may be used and are included within the scope of the present invention. The compounds obtained by using the general reaction sequences may be of insufficient purity. These compounds can be purified by using any of the methods for purification of organic compounds known to persons skilled in the art, for example, crystallization or silica gel or alumina column chromatography using different solvents in suitable ratios. All possible stereoisomers are envisioned within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of furopyrimidinyl acetamides of the general formula (I), wherein Z\n1\n, Z\n2\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, U, V and L are as defined above in description is prepared as described in Scheme 1. Coupling reaction of the compounds of the formula (1) (wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl) with amines of the formula (2) in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) and base in suitable solvent gives compounds of the formula (3). The selective N-alkylation of the compounds of the formula (3) where X is halogen, with suitable alkylating agent of the formula (4) in the presence of base in a suitable solvent gives compounds of the general formula (I).\n\n\nScheme 1\n\n\n \n\n A general approach for the synthesis of furo[2,3-fiT]pyrimidinyl acetamides of formula (Ia) wherein R\na\n is hydrogen and U, V, R\n1\n and R\n2\n are as defined above is prepared as shown is Scheme 2. Coupling reaction of 1,3-dialkylbarbituric acid derivative of the formula (5) with chloroacetyl chloride derivative (6) in the presence of a suitable base like sodium hydride and in a suitable solvent like THF gives 5-(chloroacetyl)-6-hydroxy- l,3-dialkylpyrimidine-2,4(lH,3H)-dione as an intermediate which on cyclisation in the presence of triethylamine gives furo[2,3-<i]pyrimidinetrione of formula (7). A similar approach is described by Strekowski, L. et al. in J. Heterocyclic Chem. 2001, 38, 359- 363. Furo[2,3-<i]pyrimidinetrione compounds of formula (7) was converted into furo[2,3-fiT]pyrimidinedione ester of compounds of general formula (8) by reaction with the lithium salt of ethyl acetate (generated from dry ethyl acetate and Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide [LHMDS]) followed by dehydration and isomerization under acidic conditions. Direct coupling of compounds of the general formula (8) with appropriate amines of formula (2) by using suitable base (e.g., sodium hydride) and in suitable solvent (e.g. toluene, tetrahydrofuran) gives compounds of the general formula (Ia). Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (Ia) can be prepared in two steps by hydrolysis of (8) under basic conditions to give the carboxylic acid (9) followed by coupling with amine of the general formula (2) using a suitable coupling agents [e.g., N- ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), benzotriazol- 1 - yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP] in suitable solvent or mixture of solvents (e.g., N,N-dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane etc. to give compounds of the general formula (Ia).\n\n\nScheme 2\n\n\n \n\n Alternatively, the carboxylic acid intermediate of the general formula (9) can be prepared as described in scheme 3. Thus, reaction of cyanomethyl lithium with furo[2,3- βT]pyrimidinetrione of formula (7) (where R\na\n is hydrogen or alkyl) in a suitable solvent gives furo[2,3-(i]pyrimidinyl acetonitrile of the formula (10). This intermediate on hydrolysis under acidic conditions gives intermediates of the formula (9) required for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (Ia).\n\n\nScheme 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuro[2,3-<i]pyrimidinedione ester of the formula (8a) where R\na\n is hydrogen or alkyl can also be prepared through a Wittig reaction on intermediate (7) as shown in Scheme 4. Thus, reaction of intermediate (7) with trimethyl phosphonoacetate in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide or w-butyl lithium in suitable solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dimethhyl sulfoxide) gives ester of the formula (11). The ester (11) is then isomerized under acidic conditions to give intermediates of the formula (8a) useful for the preparation of compounds of the present invention represented by the formula (Ia).\n\n\nScheme 4\n\n\nisomerisation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach for the preparation of intermediates of the general formula (8b) is given in Scheme 5. Thus, Reformatsky reaction on intermediate (7) (where R\na\n is hydrogen or alkyl) by using BrZnCH\n2\nCO\n2\nR where R is alkyl (prepared from Zn and BrCH\n2\nCChR) followed by in-situ dehydration of the carbinol intermediate gives intermediate (12). Double bond isomerization of intermediate (12) under acidic conditions gives the ester intermediate (8b). \n\n Scheme 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral approach for the synthesis of compound of foumula (Ic) (wherein R\na\n is hydrogen or methyl and R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above) is depicted in scheme 6. Direct coupling of compounds of the general formula (8) with appropriate amines of formula (23) by using suitable base (e.g., sodium hydride) and in suitable solvent (e.g. toluene, tetrahydrofuran) gives compounds of the general formula (Ic). Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (Ic) can be prepared in two steps by hydrolysis of (8) under basic conditions to give the carboxylic acid (9) followed by its coupling with amine of the general formula (23) using a suitable coupling agents [e.g., N- ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), benzotriazol-1- yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP]) in suitable solvent or mixture of solvents (e.g., N,N-dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane etc. to give compounds of the general formula (Ic).\n\n\nScheme 6\n\n\nb \n\n\n\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of furo[3,4-(/]pyrimidinyl acetamides of formula (Ib) wherein R\na\n, U, V, R\n1\n and R\n2\n are as defined above is prepared as shown is Scheme 7. 5-Methyl-4H-furo[3,4-ύT|[l,3]oxazine-2,4(lH)-dione of the formula (13) can \n\n be prepared according to the procedure described by Press, J. B., et al. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1989, 24, 627-630 starting from dialkyl 2-methylfuran-3,4-dicarboxylate. The intermediate of the formula (1) is treated with alkyl amine of the formula R^-NH\n2\n to give the urea derivative (14) through a ring opening reaction. Cyclisation of intermediate (14) using 1 , 1 '-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in suitable solvent followed by alkylation with R X in the presence of a suitable solvent gives 3,5-dialkylfuro[3,4-<i]pyrimidine-2,4(lH,3H)- dione of the formula (16) via intermediate (15). Intermediate (16) is deprotonated with a strong base such as sodium hydride or n-butyl lithium and reacted with dialkyl carbonate to give the ester (17). Coupling reaction of ester of the formula (17) with appropriate amines of formula (2) in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in the presence of suitable solvent such as dry toluene or xylene gives compounds of general formula (Ib).\n\n\nScheme 7 R\n2\nX base, solvent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of substituted 2-amino-4-aryl thiazoles of the formula (23) (wherein R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above) from benzoic acid derivatives is given in Scheme 8. Thus, benzoic acid of formula (18) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (19) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. The acid chloride of formula (19) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula (21) by treating with N,0- dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride of formula (20) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of methyl magnesium iodide to Weinreb amide of formula (21) afforded acetophenone derivative of formula (22).\n\n\nConversion of acetophenone derivative of formula (22) to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole of the formula (23) can be effected by two approaches (Scheme 8). In the first case acetophenone was converted to the corresponding phenacyl bromide, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. \n\n Alternatively, acetophenone derivative of formula (22) can be converted to 2-amino-4- aryl thiazole (23) in one step by its reaction with thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanol (Carroll, K. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950, 3722 and Naik, S. J.; Halkar, U. P., ARKIVOC 2005, xiii, 141-149).\n\n\nScheme 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\nUnless otherwise stated, work-up includes distribution of the reaction mixture between the organic and aqueous phase indicated within parentheses, separation of layers and drying the organic layer over sodium sulphate, filtration and evaporation of the solvent.

The reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue obtained was acidified to pH 6.0 by addition of 1 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n). The residue obtained after evaporation of the solvent was purified by silica gel column chromatography using suitable ethyl acetate and petroleum ether mixture to obtain the desired products. Method B:\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of furopyrimidinyl acetic acid derivative (1.0 equiv.) in 1,2- dichloroethane (5 vol.) was added EDCI (1.2 equiv.), HOBt (0.3 equiv.) and A- dimethylaminopyridine (0.1 equiv.) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10-15 min. An appropriate amine (1.0 equiv.) was then added and mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 48 h. Excess of solvent was evaporated and the residue obtained was diluted with ethyl acetate and 2 N HCl. Two layers were seperated. The organic layer was washed with water, brine, dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n) and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 30 % ethyl acetate in petroleum ether to afford the desired compound. \n\n Example 1\n\n\nNl-[4-(4-Trifluoromethylphenoxy)phenyl]-2-(l,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-l, 2,3,4- tetrahydrofuro[2,3-<i]pyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe title compound was prepared according to the general procedure (Method B) by coupling Intermediate 2 (60 mg, 0.252 mmol) with 4-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]aniline (64 mg, 0.252 mmol) in the presence of EDCI hydrochloride (58 mg, 0.302 mmol), HOBt (10 mg, 0.075 mmol) and DMAP (3.1 mg, 0.025 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (5 ml) to give 17 mg of the product as a white solid;

The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of G-418. Rat TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 μM (for human TRPAl) and / or 10 μM (for rat TRPAl) and 5 μCi/ml \n45\nCa\n+2\n for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant.
