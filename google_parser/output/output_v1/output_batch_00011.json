More specifically, the invention concerns anti-EphB4 antibodies, and uses of same.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDevelopment of a vascular supply is a fundamental requirement for many physiological and pathological processes. Actively growing tissues such as embryos and tumors require adequate blood supply. They satisfy this need by producing pro-angiogenic factors, which promote new blood vessel formation via a process called angiogenesis. Vascular tube formation is a complex but orderly biological event involving all or many of the following steps: a) endothelial cells (ECs) proliferate from existing ECs or differentiate from progenitor cells; b) ECs migrate and coalesce to form cord-like structures; c) vascular cords then undergo tubulogenesis to form vessels with a central lumen; d) existing cords or vessels send out sprouts to form secondary vessels; e) primitive vascular plexus undergo further remodeling and reshaping; and f) peri-endothelial cells are recruited to encase the endothelial tubes, providing maintenance and modulatory functions to the vessels; such cells including pericytes for small capillaries, smooth muscle cells for larger vessels, and myocardial cells in the heart. \nHanahan, Science 277:48-50 (1997\n); \nHogan & Kolodziej, Nat. Rev. Genet. 3:513-23 (2002\n); \nLubarsky & Krasnow, Cell 112:19-28 (2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now well established that angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders. These include solid tumors and metastasis, atherosclerosis, retrolental fibroplasia, hemangiomas, chronic inflammation, intraocular neovascular diseases such as proliferative retinopathies, e.g., diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular glaucoma, immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. \nFolkman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:10931-34 (1992\n); \nKlagsbrun et al., Annu. Rev. Physiol. 53:217-39 (1991\n); and \nGarner A., \"\nVascular diseases,\n\" In: Pathobiology of Ocular Disease. A Dynamic Approach, Garner A., Klintworth GK, eds., 2nd Edition (Marcel Dekker, NY, 1994), pp 1625-1710\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of tumor growth, angiogenesis appears to be crucial for the transition from hyperplasia to neoplasia, and for providing nourishment for the growth and metastasis of the tumor. \nFolkman et al., Nature 339:58 (1989\n). The neovascularization allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage and proliferative autonomy compared to the normal cells. A tumor usually begins as a single aberrant cell which can proliferate only to a size of a few cubic millimeters due to the distance from available capillary beds, and it can stay 'dormant' without further growth and dissemination for a long period of time. Some tumor cells then switch to the angiogenic phenotype to activate endothelial cells, which proliferate and mature into new capillary blood vessels. These newly formed blood vessels not only allow for continued growth of the primary tumor, but also for the dissemination and recolonization of metastatic tumor cells. Accordingly, a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors. \nWeidner et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 324:1-6 (1991\n); \nHorak et al., Lancet 340:1120-24 (1992\n);\n Macchiarini et al., Lancet 340:145-46 (1992\n). The precise mechanisms that control the angiogenic switch is not well understood, but it is believed that neovascularization of tumor mass results from the net balance of a multitude of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors (\nFolkman, Nat. Med. 1(1):27-31 (1995\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process of vascular development is tightly regulated. To date, a significant number of molecules, mostly secreted factors produced by surrounding cells, have been shown to regulate EC differentiation, proliferation, migration and coalescence into cord-like structures. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as the key factor involved in stimulating angiogenesis and in inducing vascular permeability. \nFerrara et al., Endocr. Rev. 18:4-25 (1997\n). The finding that the loss of even a single VEGF allele results in embryonic lethality points to an irreplaceable role played by this factor in the development and differentiation of the vascular system. Furthermore, VEGF has been shown to be a key mediator of neovascularization associated with tumors and intraocular disorders. \nFerrara et al., Endocr. Rev. supra\n \n.\n The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined. \nBerkman et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:153-59 (1993\n); \nBrown et al., Human Pathol. 26:86-91 (1995\n); \nBrown et al., Cancer Res. 53:4727-35 (1993\n); \nMattern et al., Brit. J. Cancer 73:931-34 (1996\n);\n Dvorak et al., Am. J. Pathol. 146:1029-39 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the concentration levels of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies. \nAiello et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 331:1480-87 (1994\n). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD. \nLopez et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 37:855-68 (1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines in nude mice (\nKim et al., Nature 362:841-44 (1993\n); \nWarren et al., J. Clin. Invest. 95:1789-97 (1995\n); \nBorgström et al., Cancer Res. 56:4032-39 (1996\n); \nMelnyk et al., Cancer Res. 56:921-24 (1996\n)) and also inhibit intraocular angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders (\nAdamis et al., Arch. Ophthalmol. 114:66-71 (1996\n)). Therefore, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of VEGF action are promising candidates for the treatment of tumors and various intraocular neovascular disorders. Such antibodies are described, for example, in \n \nEP 817,648, published January 14, 1998\n \n; and in \n \n \nWO\n 98/45331\n \n and \n \n \nWO\n 98/45332, both published October 15, 1998\n \n. One anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, has been approved by the FDA for use in combination with a chemotherapy regimen to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). And bevacizumab is being investigated in many ongoing clinical trials for treating various cancer indications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe EphB4 receptor (\"EphB4\" or \"EphB4R\") is a member of the eph receptor family, which constitutes the largest family of tyrosine kinase receptors in the human genome (reviewed in \nDodelet, Oncogene, 19: 5614-5619, 2000\n). The human eph receptor tyrosine kinases are categorized by sequence identity into an A class and a B class with corresponding A-type and B-type ligands referred to as ephrins. Signaling can occur in a forward manner, in which the receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by the ligand, and in a reverse manner, in which the transmembrane ephrinB ligands are activated by interaction with receptors. Eph receptor ligand interactions have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions including axon guidance, tissue border formation, vasculogenesis, and cell motility (\nKullander et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol., 3: 475-486, 2002\n;\n Cheng et al. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev., 13: 75-85, 2002\n; \nCoulthard et al. Int. J. Dev. Biol., 46: 375-384, 2002\n). EphB4 binds ligands such as ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, and ephrin-B3. The EphB4 receptor has an extracellular region with a cysteine-rich motif extending over its amino-terminal half followed by two fibronectin type II motifs. There is an intracellular domain featuring a conserved kinase region and a transmembrane domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is clear that there continues to be a need for agents that have clinical attributes that are optimal for development as therapeutic agents. The invention described herein meets this need and provides other benefits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is in part based on the identification of a variety of EphB4 binding agents (such as immunoconjugates, antibodies, and fragments thereof).

In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are used to treat a tumor, a cancer, and/or a cell proliferative disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention find utility as reagents for detection and/or isolation of EphB4, such as detention of EphB4 in various tissues and cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides methods of making anti-EphB4 antibodies, and polynucleotides encoding anti-EphB4 antibodies\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGeneral techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are generally well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art, such as, for example, the widely utilized methodologies described in \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd. edition (2001) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y\n. \nCURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (F. M. Ausubel, et al. eds., (2003\n)); the series \nMETHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY (Academic Press, Inc.\n): \nPCR 2: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (M. J. MacPherson, B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds. (1995\n)), \nHarlow and Lane, eds. (1988) ANTIBODIES, A LABORATORY MANUAL, and ANIMAL CELL CULTURE (R. I. Freshney, ed. (1987\n)).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody \nin situ\n within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat\" or \"amino acid position numbering as in Kabat\", and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991\n). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after \nresidue\n 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"substantially similar,\" or \"substantially the same\", as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50%, preferably less than about 40%, preferably less than about 30%, preferably less than about 20%, preferably less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the \"Kd\" or \"Kd value\" according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (\nChen, et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881\n). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23°C). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in \nPresta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599\n). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 % Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5ug/ml (~0.2uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately 25ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., \nChen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881\n. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6\n M\n-1\n S\n-1\n by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25°C of a 20nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"on-rate\" or \"rate of association\" or \"association rate\" or \"k\non\n\" according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5ug/ml (~0.2uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately 25ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., \nChen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881\n. However, if the on-rate exceeds 10\n6\n M\n-1\n S\n-1\n by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25°C of a 20nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"vector,\" as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a \"plasmid\", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"recombinant expression vectors\" (or simply, \"recombinant vectors\"). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \"plasmid\" and \"vector\" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Polynucleotide,\" or \"nucleic acid,\" as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase, or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis, such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, \"caps\", substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, intemucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S(\"thioate\"), P(S)S (\"dithioate\"), \"(O)NR\n2\n (\"amidate\"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH\n2\n (\"formacetal\"), in which each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-O-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Oligonucleotide,\" as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single stranded, generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms \"oligonucleotide\" and \"polynucleotide\" are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 program is provided in Table A below. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code shown in Table A below has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n \n \n \n100 times the fraction X/Y\n \n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.\n    \n \n \n \nUnless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"EphB4\" (interchangeably termed \"EphB4R\"), as used herein, refers, unless specifically or contextually indicated otherwise, to any native or variant (whether native or synthetic) EphB4 polypeptide. The term \"native sequence\" specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms (e.g., an extracellular domain sequence), naturally occurring variant forms (e.g., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants. The term \"wild type EphB4\" generally refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring EphB4 protein. The term \"wild type EphB4 sequence\" generally refers to an amino acid sequence found in a naturally occurring EphB4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"antibody\" and \"immunoglobulin\" are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (for e.g., full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity) and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be human, humanized and/or affinity matured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991\n)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')\n2\n fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a \"dimeric\" \" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')\n2\n antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cystemes between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"light chains\" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, s, γ, and µ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibody fragments\" comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion preferably retains at least one, preferably most or all, of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g., such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"hypervariable region\", \"HVR\", or \"HV\", when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (\nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991\n)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (\nChothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987\n)). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The \"contact\" hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.

The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat \net al., supra\n for each of these definitions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Framework\" or \"FR\" residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Humanized\" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Chimeric\" antibodies (immunoglobulins) have a portion of the heavy and/or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984\n)). Humanized antibody as used herein is a subset of chimeric antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see \nPluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"antigen\" is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, lipid, hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably, the target antigen is a polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"human antibody\" is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"affinity matured\" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. \nMarks et al. Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992\n) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: \nBarbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813 (1994\n); \nSchier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995\n); \nYelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995\n); \nJackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995\n); and \nHawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody \"effector functions\" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (\ne.g.\n B cell receptor); and B cell activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\" or \"ADCC\" refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (\ne.g\n. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies \"arm\" the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcyRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of \nRavetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991\n). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an \nin vitro\n ADCC assay, such as that described in \n \nUS Patent No. 5,500,362\n \n or \n \n5,821,337\n \n or \n \nPresta U.S. Patent No. 6,737,056\n \n may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed \nin vivo,\n e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in \nClynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Human effector cells\" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least FcγRIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g. from blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fc receptor\" or \"FcR\" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an \"activating receptor\") and FcγRIIB (an \"inhibiting receptor\"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see review M. in \nDaëron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997\n)). FcRs are reviewed in \nRavetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991\n); \nCapel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994\n); and \nde Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41 (1995\n). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \"FcR\" herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (\nGuyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976\n) and \nKim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994\n)) and regulates homeostasis of immunoglobulins. \n \nWO00/42072 (Presta\n \n) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of that patent publication is specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nShields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie 1997, Hinton 2004). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Complement dependent cytotoxicity\" or \"CDC\" refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro \net al., J. Immunol. Methods\n 202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in \n \nUS patent No. 6,194,551B1\n \n and \n \nWO99/51642\n \n. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nIdusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Fc region-comprising polypeptide\" refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin (see definitions below), which comprises an Fc region. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly, a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447, with all K447 removed, or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"blocking\" antibody or an \"antagonist\" antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"agonist antibody\", as used herein, is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"acceptor human framework\" for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework, or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework \"derived from\" a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present, preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less, or 3 or less, pre-existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those changes are only at three, two or one of positions 71 H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"human consensus framework\" is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat \net al.\n In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat \net al.\n In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat \net al.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"VH subgroup III consensus framework\" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of \nKabat et al.\n In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (SEQ ID NO:42)-H1-WVRQAPGKGLEWV (SEQ ID NO:43)-H2-RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC (SEQ ID NO:44)-H3-WGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:45).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"VL subgroup I consensus framework\" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat \net al.\n In one embodiment, the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (SEQ ID NO:46)-L1-WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY (SEQ ID NO:47)-L2-GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYC (SEQ ID NO:48)-L3-FGQGTKVEIK (SEQ ID NO:49).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"disorder\" or \"disease\" is any condition that would benefit from treatment with a substance/molecule or method of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; carcinoma, blastoma, and sarcoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"cell proliferative disorder\" and \"proliferative disorder\" refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Tumor\", as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. The terms \"cancer\", \"cancerous\", \"cell proliferative disorder\", \"proliferative disorder\" and \"tumor\" are not mutually exclusive as referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"cancer\" and \"cancerous\" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth/proliferation. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, gastric cancer, melanoma, and various types of head and neck cancer. Dysregulation of angiogenesis can lead to many disorders that can be treated by compositions and methods of the invention. These disorders include both non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions. Neoplastics include but are not limited those described above. Non-neoplastic disorders include but are not limited to undesired or aberrant hypertrophy, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, psoriatic plaques, sarcoidosis, atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic plaques, diabetic and other proliferative retinopathies including retinopathy of prematurity, retrolental fibroplasia, neovascular glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal graft neovascularization, corneal graft rejection, retinal/choroidal neovascularization, neovascularization of the angle (rubeosis), ocular neovascular disease, vascular restenosis, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), meningioma, hemangioma, angiofibroma, thyroid hyperplasias (including Grave's disease), corneal and other tissue transplantation, chronic inflammation, lung inflammation, acute lung injury/ARDS, sepsis, primary pulmonary hypertension, malignant pulmonary effusions, cerebral edema (e.g., associated with acute stroke/ closed head injury/ trauma), synovial inflammation, pannus formation in RA, myositis ossificans, hypertropic bone formation, osteoarthritis (OA), refractory ascites, polycystic ovarian disease, endometriosis, 3rd spacing of fluid diseases (pancreatitis, compartment syndrome, bums, bowel disease), uterine fibroids, premature labor, chronic inflammation such as IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), renal allograft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, nephrotic syndrome, undesired or aberrant tissue mass growth (non-cancer), hemophilic joints, hypertrophic scars, inhibition of hair growth, Osler-Weber syndrome, pyogenic granuloma retrolental fibroplasias, scleroderma, trachoma, vascular adhesions, synovitis, dermatitis, preeclampsia, ascites, pericardial effusion (such as that associated with pericarditis), and pleural effusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"treatment\" refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"neurodegenerative disease\" and \"neurodegenerative disorder\" are used in the broadest sense to include all disorders the pathology of which involves neuronal degeneration and/or dysfunction, including, without limitation, peripheral neuropathies; motorneuron disorders, such as amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease), Bell's palsy, and various conditions involving spinal muscular atrophy or paralysis; and other human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's chorea, Down's Syndrome, nerve deafness, and Meniere's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Peripheral neuropathy\" is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, most often manifested as one or a combination of motor, sensory, sensorimotor, or autonomic dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathies may, for example, be genetically acquired, can result from a systemic disease, or can be induced by a toxic agent, such as a neurotoxic drug, e. g. antineoplastic agent, or industrial or environmental pollutant. \"Peripheral sensory neuropathy\" is characterized by the degeneration of peripheral sensory neurons, which may be idiopathic, may occur, for example, as a consequence of diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), cytostatic drug therapy in cancer (e.g. treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, or taxanes, e.g. paclitaxel [TAXOL®, Bristol- Myers Squibb Oncology, Princeton, N.J.] and doxetaxel [TAXOTERE®, Rhône- Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France]), alcoholism, acquired immunodeficiency syndrom (AIDS), or genetic predisposition. Genetically acquired peripheral neuropathies include, for example, Refsum's disease, Krabbe's disease, Metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabry's disease, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, Abetalipoproteinemia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) Disease (also known as Proneal Muscular Atrophy or Hereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN)) . Most types of periphseral neuropathy develop slowly, over the course of several months or years. In clinical practice such neuropathies are called chronic. Sometimes a peripheral neuropathy develops rapidly, over the course of a few days, and is referred to as acute. Peripheral neuropathy usually affects sensory and motor nerves together so as to cause a mixed sensory and motor neuropathy, but pure sensory and pure motor neuropathy are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"individual\" is a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals (such as cows), sport animals, pets (such as cats, dogs and horses), primates, mice and rats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Mammal\" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, \netc.\n Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a substance/molecule of the invention, agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the substance/molecule, agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance/molecule, agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cytotoxic agent\" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents e.g. methotrexate, adriamicin, vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide), doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents, enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes, antibiotics, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof, and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below. Other cytotoxic agents are described below. A tumoricidal agent causes destruction of tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"chemotherapeutic agent\" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

They may be hormones themselves. Examples include anti-estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including, for example, tamoxifen (including NOLVADEX® tamoxifen), EVISTA® raloxifene, droloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, trioxifene, keoxifene, LY117018, onapristone, and FARESTON® toremifene; anti-progesterones; estrogen receptor down-regulators (ERDs); agents that function to suppress or shut down the ovaries, for example, leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as LUPRON® and ELIGARD®) leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, buserelin acetate and tripterelin; other anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide; and aromatase inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme aromatase, which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands, such as, for example, 4(5)-imidazoles, aminoglutethimide, MEGASE® megestrol acetate, AROMASIN® exemestane, formestanie, fadrozole, RIVISOR® vorozole, FEMARA® letrozole, and ARIMIDEX® anastrozole. In addition, such definition of chemotherapeutic agents includes bisphosphonates such as clodronate (for example, BONEFOS® or OSTAC®), DIDROCAL® etidronate, NE-58095, ZOMETA® zoledronic acid/zoledronate, FOSAMAX® alendronate, AREDIA® pamidronate, SKELID® tiludronate, or ACTONEL® risedronate; as well as troxacitabine (a 1,3-dioxolane nucleoside cytosine analog); antisense oligonucleotides, particularly those that inhibit expression of genes in signaling pathways implicated in abherant cell proliferation, such as, for example, PKC-alpha, Raf, H-Ras, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R); vaccines such as THERATOPE® vaccine and gene therapy vaccines, for example, ALLOVECTIN® vaccine, LEUVECTIN® vaccine, and VAXID® vaccine; LURTOTECAN® topoisomerase 1 inhibitor; ABARELIX® rmRH; lapatinib ditosylate (an ErbB-2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase small-molecule inhibitor also known as GW572016); and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"growth inhibitory agent\" when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell (such as a cell expressing EphB4) either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells (such as a cell expressing EphB4) in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in \nThe Molecular Basis of Cancer, Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., \n. The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE®, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL®, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Doxorubicin\" is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is (8S-cis)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-lyxo-hexapyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"anti-neoplastic composition\" refers to a composition useful in treating cancer comprising at least one active therapeutic agent, e.g., \"anti-cancer agent\". Examples of therapeutic agents (anti-cancer agents, also termed \"anti-neoplastic agent\" herein) include, but are limited to, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, agents used in radiation therapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, toxins, and other-agents to treat cancer, e.g., anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody, VEGF antagonist, anti-HER-2, anti-CD20, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), HER1/EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, a COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), interferons, cytokines, antagonists (e.g., neutralizing antibodies) that bind to one or more of the ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, or VEGF receptor(s), inhibitors for receptor tyrosine kinases for platet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and/or stem cell factor (SCF) (e.g., imatinib mesylate (Gleevec ® Novartis)), TRAIL/Apo2, and other bioactive and organic chemical agents, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"prodrug\" as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., \nWilman, \"\nProdrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy\n\" Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986\n) and \nStella et al., \"\nProdrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,\n\" Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985\n). The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, beta-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"anti-angiogenesis agent\" or \"angiogenesis inhibitor\" refers to a small molecular weight substance, a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, or undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. For example, an anti-angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to VEGF receptors, small molecules that block VEGF receptor signaling (e.g., PTK787/ZK2284, SU6668, SUTENT/SU11248 (sunitinib malate), AMG706). Anti-angiogensis agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g., angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g., \nKlagsbrun and D'Amore, Annu. Rev. Physiol., 53:217-39 (1991\n); \nStreit and Detmar, Oncogene, 22:3172-3179 (2003\n) (e.g., Table 3 listing anti-angiogenic therapy in malignant melanoma); \nFerrara & Alitalo, Nature Medicine 5(12):1359-1364 (1999\n); \nTonini et al., Oncogene, 22:6549-6556 (2003\n) (e.g., Table 2 listing antiangiogenic factors); and, \nSato Int. J. Clin. Oncol., 8:200-206 (2003\n) (e.g., Table 1 lists Anti-angiogenic agents used in clinical trials).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCompositions of the invention and methods of making same\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, comprising an anti-EphB4 antibody; and polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding an anti-EphB4 antibody. As used herein, compositions comprise one or more antibodies that bind to EphB4, and/or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more antibodies that bind to EphB4. These compositions may further comprise suitable carriers, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses isolated antibody and polynucleotide embodiments. The invention also encompasses substantially pure antibody and polynucleotide embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention are preferably monoclonal. Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are Fab, Fab', Fab'-SH and F(ab')\n2\n fragments of the anti-EphB4 antibodies provided herein. These antibody fragments can be created by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or may be generated by recombinant techniques. Such antibody fragments may be chimeric or humanized. These fragments are useful for the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes set forth below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to EphB4 generally are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of EphB4 and an adjuvant. EphB4 may be prepared using methods well-known in the art, some of which are further described herein. For example, recombinant production of EphB4 is described below. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with a derivative of EphB4 that contains the extracellular domain (ECD) of EphB4 fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In a preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with an EphB4-IgG1 fusion protein. Animals ordinarily are immunized against immunogenic conjugates or derivatives of EphB4 with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)/trehalose dicrynomycolate (TDM) (Ribi Immunochem. Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT) and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti-EphB4 titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized \nin vitro.\n Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (\nKozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against EphB4. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an \nin vitro\n binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of \nMunson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986\n)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in \nvivo\n as ascites tumors in an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-EphB4 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda MD (1991), vols. 1-3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as \"Fv phage clones\" or \"Fv clones\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Altematively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993\n). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFilamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by \nMarks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in \nHoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-EphB4 clones is desired, the subject is immunized with EphB4 to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-EphB4 clones is obtained by generating an anti-EphB4 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that EphB4 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against EphB4. The generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-EphB4 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing EphB4-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation with EphB4 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled EphB4 followed by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which EphB4 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in \nOrlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989\n), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in \nOrlandi et al.\n (1989) and in \nWard et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989\n). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in \nJones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991\n), and forward primers within the constant region as described in \nSastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989\n). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in \nOrlandi et al.\n (1989) or \nSastry et al.\n (1989). Preferably, the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n) or as described in the method of \nOrum et a/., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993\n). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in \nOrlandi et al.\n (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nTomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992\n)), and mapped (reported in \nMatsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993\n); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992\n). Human V\nK\n and Vλ segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nWilliams and Winter, Eur. J Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993\n)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of \nHoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in \nHogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993\n), or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n). The \nin vivo\n recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE. coli\n transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12\n clones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n-8\n M).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, \"in cell PCR assembly\" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in \nEmbleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked \nin vitro\n by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in \nWinter et al.\n (1994), \nsupra.\n For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in \nLeung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989\n)) in the method of \nHawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992\n) or in the method of \nGram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992\n). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. \n \nWO 9607754 (published 14 March 1996\n \n) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10\n-9\n M range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEphB4 nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are known in the art. Nucleic acid sequence encoding the EphB4 can be designed using the amino acid sequence of the desired region of EphB4. Alternatively, the cDNA sequence (or fragments thereof) of GenBank Accession Nos. NM_004444, or disclosed in \n \nU.S. patent No. 5,635,177\n \n, can be used. DNAs encoding EphB4 can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in \nEngels et al., Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 28: 716-734 (1989\n), such as the triester, phosphite, phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate methods. In one embodiment, codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the EphB4 encoding DNA. Alternatively, DNA encoding the EphB4 can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing construction of the DNA molecule encoding the EphB4, the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector, such as a plasmid, wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general, plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Suitable vectors for expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known in the art and some are further described herein. Eukaryotic organisms, such as yeasts, or cells derived from multicellular organisms, such as mammals, may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the DNA encoding the EphB4 is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII, ecotin, lamB, herpes GD, lpp, alkaline phosphatase, invertase, and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A (\nAbrahmsen et al., EMBO J., 4: 3901 (1985\n \n)).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO\n4\n precipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell. Methods for transfection are well known in the art, and some are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. Methods for transformation are well known in the art, and some are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells used to produce the EphB4 can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook \net al., supra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mammalian host cells used to produce the EphB4 can be cultured in a variety of media, which is well known in the art and some of which is described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in \nin vitro\n culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of EphB4 may be accomplished using art-recognized methods, some of which are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe purified EphB4 can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads, acrylamide beads, glass beads, cellulose, various acrylic copolymers, hydroxyl methacrylate gels, polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers, nylon, neutral and ionic carriers, and the like, for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the EphB4 protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in \nMethods in Enzymology, vol. 44 (1976\n). A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices, e.g. agarose, dextran or cellulose, involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand's primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, EphB4 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other art-known method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized EphB4 under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or by alkali, e.g. as described in \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or by EphB4 antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n, and a low coating density of antigen as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for EphB4. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting EphB4, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants, phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated EphB4, but with the biotinylated EphB4 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for EphB4. The high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such \"equilibrium capture\" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-EphB4 cones may be activity selected. In one embodiment, the invention provides anti-EphB4 antibodies that block the binding between an EphB4 ligand (such as ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2 and/or ephrin-B3) and EphB4, but do not block the binding between an EphB4 ligand and a second protein (such as \nEphB\n 1, EphB3, EphB4, EphB5 and/or EphB6). Fv clones corresponding to such anti-EphB4 antibodies can be selected by (1) isolating anti-EphB4 clones from a phage library as described above, and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host; (2) selecting EphB4 and a second protein against which blocking and non-blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti-EphB4 phage clones to immobilized EphB4; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize EphB4-binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. \ncoli\n cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include \nSkerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5: 256 (1993\n) and \nPluckthun, Immunol. Revs, 130: 151 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and/or light chain constant regions (e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat \net al.,\n supra) to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and/or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. A Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human) species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence(s) for \"hybrid\", full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the definition of \"chimeric\" and \"hybrid\" antibody as used herein. In a preferred embodiment, a Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence(s) for all human, full or partial length heavy and/or light chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding anti-EphB4 antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone (e.g. as in the method of \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984\n)). DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone-derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone-derived antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAntibody Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses antibody fragments. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., \nMorimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992\n); and \nBrennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985\n)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (\nCarter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992\n)). According to another approach, F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab')\n2\n fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046\n \n. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See \n \nWO 93/16185\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894\n \n; and \n \n5,587,458\n \n. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See \nAntibody Engineering, ed. Borrebaeck, supra\n. The antibody fragment may also be a \"linear antibody\", e.g., as described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870\n \n for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHumanized Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \"import\" residues, which are typically taken from an \"import\" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (\nJones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522-525\n; \nRiechmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-327\n; \nVerhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239:1534-1536\n), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \"humanized\" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called \"best-fit\" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (\nSims et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:2296\n; \nChothia et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901\n. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (\nCarter et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285\n; \nPresta et al. (1993) J. Immunol., 151:2623\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies arc prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, \ni.e.\n, the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHuman antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s) as described above. Alternatively, human monoclonal anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by \nKozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n); and \nBoerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., \nJakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 90: 2551 (1993\n); \nJakobovits et al., Nature, 362: 255 (1993\n); \nBruggermann el al., Year in Immunol., 7: 33 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human, e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called \"epitope imprinting\", either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described above is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see \n \nPCT WO 93/06213 published April 1, 1993\n \n). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBispecific Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for EphB4 and the other is for any other antigen. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the EphB4 protein. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express EphB4. These antibodies possess an EphB4-binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (\ne.g\n. saporin, anti-interferon-α, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (\ne.g\n. F(ab')\n2\n bispecific antibodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, \nNature,\n \n305\n: 537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in \n \nWO 93/08829 published May 13, 1993\n \n, and in\n Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10: 3655 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different and more preferred approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in \n \nWO 94/04690\n \n. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, \nSuresh et al., Methods in Enzymology,, 121:210 (1986\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another approach, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \"cavities\" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (\ne.g.\n alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \"heteroconjugate\" antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (\n \nUS Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n), and for treatment of HIV infection (\n \nWO 91/00360\n \n, \n \nWO 92/00373\n \n, and \n \nEP 03089\n \n). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in \n \nUS Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. \nBrennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985\n) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab')\n2\n fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from \nE. coli\n, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. \nShalaby et al., J. Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992\n) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')\n2\n molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli\n and subjected to directed chemical coupling \nin vitro\n to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. \nKostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992\n). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \"diabody\" technology described by \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993\n) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See \nGruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. \nTutt et al. J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMultivalent Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fe region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n -VD2-(X2)n -Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAntibody Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085\n. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (\ne.g\n., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation \nper se\n need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (\ne.g\n. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No \n \nUS 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.\n \n). See also \n \nUS 2004/0093621\n \n (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in \n \nWO 2003/011878\n \n, Jean-Mairet \net al.\n and \n \nUS Patent No. 6,602,684\n \n, Umana \net al.\n Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in \n \nWO 1997/30087, Patel et al.\n \n See, also, \n \nWO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.\n \n) and \n \nWO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.\n \n) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also \n \nUS 2005/0123546 (Umana et al\n \n.) on antigen-binding molecules with modified glycosylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred glycosylation variant herein comprises an Fc region, wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally, the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC, for example, substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (Eu numbering of residues). Examples of publications related to \"defucosylated\" or \"fucose-deficient\" antibodies include: \n \nUS 2003/0157108\n \n; \n \nWO 2000/61739\n \n; \n \nWO 2001/29246\n \n; \n \nUS 2003/0115614\n \n; \n \nUS 2002/0164328\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0093621\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0132140\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0110704\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0110282\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0109865\n \n; \n \nWO 2003/085119\n \n; \n \nWO 2003/084570\n \n; \n \nWO 2005/035586\n \n; \n \nWO 2005/035778\n \n; \n \nWO2005/053742\n \n; \nOkazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004\n);\n Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004\n). Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (\nRipka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986\n); US Pat Appl No \n \nUS 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L\n \n; and \n \nWO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al\n \n., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, \nFUT8\n,knockout CHO cells (\nYamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"preferred substitutions\". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \nOriginal\n \n \n \nExemplary\n \n \n \nPreferred\n \n \n \n \n \nResidue\n \n \n \nSubstitutions\n \n \n \nSubstitutions\n \n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nVal; Leu; Ile\n \nVal\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nLys; Gln; Asn\n \nLys\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \nGln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg\n \nGln\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nGlu; Asn\n \nGlu\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nSer; Ala\n \nSer\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nAsn; Glu\n \nAsn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nAsp; Gln\n \nAsp\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nAla\n \nAla\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nAsn; Gln; Lys; Arg\n \nArg\n \n \n \nIle (I)\n \nLeu; Val; Met; Ala;\n \nLeu\n \n \n \n \n \nPhe; Norleucine\n \n \n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nNorleucine; Ile; Val;\n \nIle\n \n \n \n \n \nMet; Ala; Phe\n \n \n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \nArg; Gln; Asn\n \nArg\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nLeu; Phe; Ile\n \nLeu\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nTrp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr\n \nTyr\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nAla\n \nAla\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nThr\n \nThr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nVal; Ser\n \nSer\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \nTyr; Phe\n \nTyr\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \nTrp; Phe; Thr; Ser\n \nPhe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nIle; Leu; Met; Phc; Ala; Norleucine\n \nLeu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n \n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n \n(4) basic: his, lys, arg;\n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n \n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (\ne.g\n. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (\ne.g\n. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (\ne.g\n. binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention, thereby generating a Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (\ne.g\n., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (\ne.g\n. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine. In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody used in methods of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example, it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in \n \nWO99/51642\n \n.

The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nShields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001\n). Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (\nGuyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976\n) and \nKim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994\n)), are described in \n \nUS2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.\n \n). These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in \n \nUS patent No. 6,194,551B1\n \n, \n \nWO99/51642\n \n. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nIdusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAntibody Derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymers are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nScreening for antibodies with desired properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical/chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art. In some embodiments, antibodies are characterized for any one or more of reduction or blocking of EphB4 activation, reduction or blocking of EphB4 downstream molecular signaling, reduction or blocking of EphB4 ligand activation, reduction or blocking or EphB4 ligand downstream molecular signaling, disruption or blocking of ligand (e.g., ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, and/or ephrin-B3) binding to EphB4, EphB4 phosphorylation and/or EphB4 multimerization, and/or EphB4 ligand phosphorylation, and/or treatment and/or prevention of a tumor, cell proliferative disorder or a cancer; and/or treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with EphB4 expression and/or activity (such as increased EphB4 expression and/or activity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe purified antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, non-denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the antibodies produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \"sandwich\" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays. Illustrative antigen binding assay are provided below in the Examples section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another embodiment, the invention provides anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibodies that compete with 30.35, 30.35.1D2 and/or 30.35.2D8 antibody for binding to EphB4. Such competitor antibodies include antibodies that recognize an EphB4 epitope that is the same as or overlaps with the EphB4 epitope recognized by antibody 30.35, 30.35.1D2 and/or 30.35.2D8. Such competitor antibodies can be obtained by screening anti-EphB4 hybridoma supernatants for binding to immobilized EphB4 in competition with labeled 30.35, 30.35.1D2 and/or 30.35.2D8 antibody. A hybridoma supernatant containing competitor antibody will reduce the amount of bound, labeled antibody detected in the subject competition binding mixture as compared to the amount of bound, labeled antibody detected in a control binding mixture containing irrelevant (or no) antibody. Any of the competition binding assays described herein are suitable for use in the foregoing procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibody that comprises one or more (such as 2, 3, 4, 5, and/or 6) HVRs of the 30.35, 30.35.1D2 or 30.35.2D8 antibody. An anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibody that comprises one or more HVR(s) of 30.35, 30.35.1D2 and/or 30.35.2D8 can be constructed by grafting one or more HVR(s) of 30.35, 30.35.1D2 and/or 30.35.2D8 onto a template antibody sequence, e.g. a human antibody sequence which is closest to the corresponding murine sequence of the parental antibody, or a consensus sequence of all human antibodies in the particular subgroup of the parental antibody light or heavy chain, and expressing the resulting chimeric light and/or heavy chain variable region sequence(s), with or without accompanying constant region sequence(s), in recombinant host cells as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention possessing the unique properties described herein can be obtained by screening anti-EphB4 hybridoma clones for the desired properties by any convenient method. For example, if an anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibody that blocks or does not block the binding of EphB4 ligands to EphB4 is desired, the candidate antibody can be tested in a binding competition assay, such as a competitive binding ELISA, wherein plate wells are coated with EphB4, and a solution of antibody in an excess of the Eph ligand of interest is layered onto the coated plates, and bound antibody is detected enzymatically, e.g. contacting the bound antibody with HRP-conjugated anti-Ig antibody or biotinylated anti-Ig antibody and developing the HRP color reaction., e.g. by developing plates with streptavidin-HRP and/or hydrogen peroxide and detecting the HRP color reaction by spectrophotometry at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an anti-EphB4 antibody that inhibits or activates EphB4 activation is desired, the candidate antibody can be testing an EphB4 phosphorylation assay. Such assays are known in the art and one such assay is described in the Examples section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an anti-EphB4 antibody inhibits cell growth is desired, the candidate antibody can be tested in in vitro and/or in vivo assays that measure inhibition of cell growth. Such assays are known in the art and are further described and exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of \nRavetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991\n). An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in \n \nUS Patent No. 5,500,362\n \n or \n \n5,821,337\n \n. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in \nClynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998\n). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in \nGazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996\n), may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art, e.g. those described in the Examples section.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally, preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.\n\n\n \na. Generating antibodies using prokaryotic host cells:\n\n\n\n\ni. Vector Construction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in \n \nCarter et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,648,237\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example, bacteriophage such as λGEM.TM.-11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as E. coli LE392.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs, encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream (5') to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the β-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains (\nSiebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269\n) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains (e.g., the E. coli trxB- strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. \nProba and Pluckthun Gene, 159:203 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include Escherichia (e.g., E. coli), Bacilli (e.g., B. subtilis), Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas species (e.g., P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla, or Paracoccus. In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used. In one embodiment, E. coli cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of E. coli strains include strain W3110 (\nBachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219\n; ATCC Deposit No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 ΔfhuA (ΔtonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ΔompTΔ(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635\n \n). Other strains and derivatives thereof, such as E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), E. coli B, E. coliλ 1776 (ATCC 31,537) and E. coli RV308(ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, \nBass et al., Proteins, 8:309-314 (1990\n). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.\n\n\n \n\n\nii. Antibody Production\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For E. coli growth, for example, the preferred temperature ranges from about 20°C to about 39°C, more preferably from about 25°C to about 37°C, even more preferably at about 30°C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. For E. coli, the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4, and more preferably about 7.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly, the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. Preferably, the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium (see, e.g., \nSimmons et al., J. Immunol. Methods (2002), 263:133-147\n). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity, preferably about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (the preferred carbon/energy source). Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD550 of about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. \nChen et al. (1999) J Bio Chem 274:19601-19605\n; \n \nGeorgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,083,715\n \n; \n \nGeorgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,027,888\n \n; \nBothmann and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:17100-17105\n; \nRamm and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:17106-17113\n; \nArie et al. (2001) Mol. Microbiol. 39:199-210\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some E. coli protease-deficient strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; \n \nGeorgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,264,365\n \n; \n \nGeorgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,508,192\n \n; \nHara et al., Microbial Drug Resistance, 2:63-72 (1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, E. coli strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\niii. Antibody Purification\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStandard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41kD cell wall protein from Staphylococcus aureas which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. \nLindmark et al (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13\n. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface, more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column has been coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the first step of purification, the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.\n\n\n \nb. Generating antibodies using eukaryotic host cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n\n\n(i) Signal sequence component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Origin of replication\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Selection gene component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,965,199\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Promoter component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,419,446\n \n. A modification of this system is described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,601,978\n \n. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n \n\n\n(v) Enhancer element component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTranscription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also \nYaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982\n) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.\n\n\n \n\n\n(vi) Transcription termination component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See \n \nWO94/11026\n \n and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n\n\n(vii) Selection and transformation of host cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, \nGraham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977\n)) ; baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, \nUrlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980\n)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, \nMather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980\n)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (\nMather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982\n)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n\n\n(viii) Culturing the host cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in \nHam et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979\n), \nBarnes et al., Anal. Biochem. 102:255 (1980\n), \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704\n \n; \n \n4,657,866\n \n; \n \n4,927,762\n \n; \n \n4,560,655\n \n; or \n \n5,122,469\n \n; \n \nWO 90/03430\n \n; \n \nWO 87/00195\n \n; or \n \nU.S. Patent Re. 30,985\n \n may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ix) Purification of antibody\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (\nLindmark et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13 (1983\n)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (\nGuss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986\n)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImmunoconjugates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides immunoconjugates (interchangeably termed \"antibody-drug conjugates\" or \"ADC\"), comprising any of the anti-OX40L antibodies described herein conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (\nSyrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614\n; \nNiculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26:151-172\n; \n \nU.S. patent 4,975,278\n \n) allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (\nBaldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05\n; \nThorpe, (1985) \"\nAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\n\" in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506\n). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (\nRowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87\n). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (\nMandler et al (2000) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581\n; \nMandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028\n; \nMandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791\n), maytansinoids (\n \nEP 1391213\n \n; \nLiu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623\n), and calicheamicin (\nLode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928\n; \nHinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342\n). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and \n111\nIn or \n90\nY radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (\nWiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77\n;\n Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42\n; \nWitzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63\n; \nWitzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69\n). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; \n \nUS Patent Nos. 4970198\n \n; \n \n5079233\n \n; \n \n5585089\n \n; \n \n5606040\n \n; \n \n5693762\n \n; \n \n5739116\n \n; \n \n5767285\n \n; \n \n5773001\n \n). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas) and cAC10 (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies) (\nDoronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784\n) and are under therapeutic development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein (eg., above). Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. See, e.g., \n \nWO 93/21232 published October 28, 1993\n \n. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include \n212\nBi, \n131\nI, \n131\nIn, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in \nVitetta et al., Science, 238: 1098 (1987\n). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See \n \nWO94/11026\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, dolastatins, aurostatins, a trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, are also contemplated herein.\n\n\n \ni. Maytansine and maytansinoids\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody (full length or fragments) of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,896,111\n \n). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,151,042\n \n). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,137,230\n \n; \n \n4,248,870\n \n; \n \n4,256,746\n \n; \n \n4,260,608\n \n; \n \n4,265,814\n \n; \n \n4,294,757\n \n; \n \n4,307,016\n \n; \n \n4,308,268\n \n; \n \n4,308,269\n \n; \n \n4,309,428\n \n; \n \n4,313,946\n \n; \n \n4,315,929\n \n; \n \n4,317,821\n \n; \n \n4,322,348\n \n; \n \n4,331,598\n \n; \n \n4,361,650\n \n; \n \n4,364,866\n \n; \n \n4,424,219\n \n; \n \n4,450,254\n \n; \n \n4,362,663\n \n; and \n \n4,371,533\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification, derivatization of fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates containing maytansinoids, methods of making same, and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,208,020\n \n, \n \n5,416,064\n \n and European Patent \n \nEP 0 425 235 B1\n \n, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. \nLiu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623 (1996\n) described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. \nChari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992\n) describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA. that binds the HER-2/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3 x 10\n5\n HER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n (the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference). An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n or \n \nEP Patent 0 425 235 B1\n \n, \nChari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992\n), and \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 10/960,602, filed Oct. 8, 2004\n \n, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 10/960,602, filed Oct. 8, 2004\n \n. The linking groups include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents, disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Particularly preferred coupling agents include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (\nCarlsson et al., Biochem. J. 173:723-737 (1978\n)) and N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.\n\n\n \nii. Auristatins and dolastatins\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives, the auristatins (\n \nUS Patent Nos. 5635483\n \n; \n \n5780588\n \n). Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (\nWoyke et al (2001) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584\n) and have anticancer (\n \nUS 5663149\n \n) and antifungal activity (\nPettit et al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-2965\n). The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety (\n \nWO 02/088172\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary auristatin embodiments include the N-terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF, disclosed in \"Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands\", \n \nUS Ser. No. 10/983,340, filed Nov. 5, 2004\n \n, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see \nE. Schröder and K. Lübke, \"\nThe Peptides\n\", \n) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of: \n \nUS 5635483\n \n; \n \nUS 5780588\n \n; \nPettit et al (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:5463-5465\n; \nPettit et al (1998) Anti-Cancer Drug Design 13:243-277\n; \nPettit, G.R., et al. Synthesis, 1996, 719-725\n; and \nPettit et al (1996) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5:859-863\n. See also \nDoronina (2003) Nat Biotechnol 21(7):778-784\n; \"Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands\", \n \nUS Ser. No. 10/983,340, filed Nov. 5, 2004\n \n, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety (disclosing, e.g., linkers and methods of preparing monomethylvaline compounds such as MMAE and MMAF conjugated to linkers).\n\n\n \niii. Calicheamicin\n\n\n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see \n \nU.S. patents 5,712,374\n \n, \n \n5,714,586\n \n, \n \n5,739,116\n \n, \n \n5,767,285\n \n, \n \n5,770,701\n \n, \n \n5,770,710\n \n, \n \n5,773,001\n \n, \n \n5,877,296\n \n (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, γ\n1\n \nI\n, α\n2\n \nI\n, α\n3\n \nI\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \nI\n, PSAG and θ\nI\n \n1\n (\nHinman et al., Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993\n), \nLode et al., Cancer Research 58:2925-2928 (1998\n) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.\n\n\n \niv. Other cytotoxic agents\n\n\n \n \n \nOther antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozoicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively LL-E33288 complex described in \n \nU.S. patents 5,053,394\n \n, \n \n5,770,710\n \n, as well as esperamicins (\n \nU.S. patent 5,877,296\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, \n \nWO 93/21232 published October 28, 1993\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor selective destruction of the tumor, the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212\n and radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc\n99m\n or I\n123\n, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tc\n99m\n or I\n123\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n and In\n111\n can be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (\nFraker et al (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57\n) can be used to incorporate iodine-123. \"\nMonoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy\" (Chatal,CRC Press 1989\n) describes other methods in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in \nVitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987\n). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See \n \nWO94/11026\n \n. The linker may be a \"cleavable linker\" facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (\nChari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992\n); \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n) may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with crosslinker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL., U.S.A). See \npages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.\n \n\n\n \nv. Preparation of antibody drug conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the antibody drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention, an antibody (Ab) is conjugated to one or more drug moieties (D), e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, through a linker (L). The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein.\n\n\n\n        Ab-(L-D)\np\n I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (\"MC\"), maleimidopropanoyl (\"MP\"), valine-citrulline (\"val-cit\"), alanine-phenylalanine (\"ala-phe\"), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (\"PAB\"), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (\"SPP\"), N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (\"SMCC'), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate (\"SIAB\"). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also \"Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands\", \n \nUS Ser. No. 10/983,340, filed Nov. 5, 2004\n \n, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (\nGeoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146\n; \n \nUS 5362852\n \n). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a \"receptor\" (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a \"ligand\" (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).\n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th edition (2000\n)), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th edition (2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations to be used for \nin vivo\n administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, \ne.g.\n, films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37°C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \n\n\nUses\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn antibody of the present invention may be used in, for example, \nin vitro\n, \nex vivo\n and \nin vivo\n therapeutic methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing a tumor, a cancer, and/or a cell proliferative disorder associated with increased expression and/or activity of EphB4, the methods comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-EphB4 antibody to a subject in need of such treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for reducing, inhibiting, or preventing growth of a tumor or cancer, the methods comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-EphB4 antibody to a subject in need of such treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEphB4 has been implicated in motoaxon guidance and neural crest cell migration in the developing embryo. Accordingly, the antibodies of the invention are also useful in the treatment (including prevention) of disorders the pathology of which involves cellular degeneration or disfunction, such as treatment of various (chronic) neurodegenerative disorders and acute nerve cell injuries. Such neurodegenerative disorders include, without limitation, peripheral neuropathies; motorneuron disorders, such as amylotrophic lateral schlerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease), Bell's palsy, and various conditions involving spinal muscular atrophy or paralysis; and other human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple schlerosis, Huntington's chorea, Down's Syndrome, nerve deafness, and Meniere's disease, and acute nerve cell injuries, for example due to trauma or spinal cord injury.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention are also useful for inhibiting angiogenesis. In some embodiments, the site of angiogenesis is a tumor or cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for inhibiting angiogenesis comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-EphB4 antibody to a subject in need of such treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a pathological condition associated with angiogenesis comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-EphB4 antibody to a subject in need of such treatment. In some embodiments, the pathological condition associated with angiogenesis is a tumor, a cancer, and/or a cell proliferative disorder. In some embodiments, the pathological condition associated with angiogenesis is an intraocular neovascular disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, at least some of the antibodies of the invention can bind antigen from other species. Accordingly, the antibodies of the invention can be used to bind specific antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing the antigen, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts (e.g. chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus and rhesus, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for binding an antigen in a subject suffering from a disorder associated with increased antigen expression and/or activity, comprising administering to the subject an antibody of the invention such that the antigen in the subject is bound. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject. Alternatively, the subject can be a mammal expressing the antigen with which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which the antigen has been introduced (e.g., by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene). An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing an antigen with which the immunoglobulin cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit, delay progression of, prevent/delay recurrence of, ameliorate, or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with expression and/or activity of one or more antigen molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary disorders include carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, cancer of the urinary tract, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma and B-cell lymphoma, brain, as well as head and neck cancer, and associated metastases. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas, melanoma, breast carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) is administered to the patient. In some embodiments, the immunoconjugate and/or antigen to which it is bound is/are internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with microtubule polymerization. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein (such as a maytansinoid, auristatin, dolastatin, or a calicheamicin), a radioactive isotope, or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance, an antibody of the invention may be co-administered with another antibody, chemotherapeutic agent(s) (including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents), other cytotoxic agent(s), anti-angiogenic agent(s), cytokines, and/or growth inhibitory agent(s). Where an antibody of the invention inhibits tumor growth, it may be particularly desirable to combine it with one or more other therapeutic agent(s) which also inhibits tumor growth. Alternatively, or additionally, the patient may receive combined radiation therapy (e.g. external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent, such as an antibody). Such combined therapies noted above include combined administration (where the two or more agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to, and/or following, administration of the adjunct therapy or therapies.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \nAs indicated above, the invention provides combined therapies in which an anti-EphB4 antibody is administered with another therapy. For example, anti-EphB4 antibodies are used in combinations with anti-cancer therapeutics or an anti-neovascularization therapeutics to treat various neoplastic or non-neoplastic conditions. In one embodiment, the neoplastic or non-neoplastic condition is characterized by pathological disorder associated with aberrant or undesired angiogenesis. The anti-EphB4 antibody can be administered serially or in combination with another agent that is effective for those purposes, either in the same composition or as separate compositions. Alternatively, or additionally, multiple inhibitors of EphB4 can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of the anti-EphB4 antibody can be done simultaneously, e.g., as a single composition or as two or more distinct compositions using the same or different administration routes. Alternatively, or additionally, the administration can be done sequentially, in any order. In certain embodiments, intervals ranging from minutes to days, to weeks to months, can be present between the administrations of the two or more compositions. For example, the anti-cancer agent may be administered first, followed by the EphB4 inhibitor. However, simultaneous administration or administration of the anti-EphB4 antibody first is also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amounts of therapeutic agents administered in combination with an anti-EphB4 antibody will be at the physician's or veterinarian's discretion. Dosage administration and adjustment is done to achieve maximal management of the conditions to be treated. The dose will additionally depend on such factors as the type of therapeutic agent to be used and the specific patient being treated. Suitable dosages for the anti-cancer agent are those presently used and can be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the anti-cancer agent and the anti-EphB4 antibody. In certain embodiments, the combination of the inhibitors potentiates the efficacy of a single inhibitor. The term \"potentiate\" refers to an improvement in the efficacy of a therapeutic agent at its common or approved dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the anti-EphB4 antibodies and anti-cancer agents are suitable for the same or similar diseases to block or reduce a pathological disorder such as tumor growth or growth of a cancer cell. In one embodiment the anti-cancer agent is an anti-angiogenesis agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntiangiogenic therapy in relationship to cancer is a cancer treatment strategy aimed at inhibiting the development of tumor blood vessels required for providing nutrients to support tumor growth. Because angiogenesis is involved in both primary tumor growth and metastasis, the antiangiogenic treatment provided by the invention is capable of inhibiting the neoplastic growth of tumor at the primary site as well as preventing metastasis of tumors at the secondary sites, therefore allowing attack of the tumors by other therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany anti-angiogenic agents have been identified and are known in the arts, including those listed herein, e.g., listed under Definitions, and by, e.g., \nCarmeliet and Jain, Nature 407:249-257 (2000\n); \nFerrara et al., Nature Reviews:Drug Discovery, 3:391-400 (2004\n); and \nSato Int. J. Clin. Oncol., 8:200-206 (2003\n). See also, US Patent Application \n \nUS20030055006\n \n. In one embodiment, an anti-EphB4 antibody is used in combination with an anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody (or fragment) and/or another VEGF antagonist or a VEGF receptor antagonist including, but not limited to, for example, soluble VEGF receptor (e.g., VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, neuropillins (e.g., NRP1, NRP2)) fragments, aptamers capable of blocking VEGF or VEGFR, neutralizing anti-VEGFR antibodies, low molecule weight inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinases (RTK), antisense strategies for VEGF, ribozymes against VEGF or VEGF receptors, antagonist variants of VEGF; and any combinations thereof. Alternatively, or additionally, two or more angiogenesis inhibitors may optionally be co-administered to the patient in addition to VEGF antagonist and other agent. In certain embodiment, one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., anti-cancer agents, can be administered in combination with anti-EphB4 antibody, the VEGF antagonist, and an anti-angiogenesis agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects of the invention, other therapeutic agents useful for combination tumor therapy with a anti-EphB4 antibody include other cancer therapies, (e.g., surgery, radiological treatments (e.g., involving irradiation or administration of radioactive substances), chemotherapy, treatment with anti-cancer agents listed herein and known in the art, or combinations thereof). Alternatively, or additionally, two or more antibodies binding the same or two or more different antigens disclosed herein can be co-administered to the patient. Sometimes, it may be beneficial to also administer one or more cytokines to the patient.\n\n\n \nChemotherapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, the invention provides a method of blocking or reducing tumor growth or growth of a cancer cell, by administering effective amounts of an antagonist of EphB4 and/or an angiogenesis inhibitor(s) and one or more chemotherapeutic agents to a patient susceptible to, or diagnosed with, cancer. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in the combined treatment methods of the invention. An exemplary and non-limiting list of chemotherapeutic agents contemplated is provided herein under \"Definitions.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the appropriate doses of chemotherapeutic agents will be generally around those already employed in clinical therapies wherein the chemotherapeutics are administered alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics. Variation in dosage will likely occur depending on the condition being treated. The physician administering treatment will be able to determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject.\n\n\n \nRelapse Tumor Growth\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth. Relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth is used to describe a condition in which patients undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies (e.g., cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, hormonal therapy and/or biological therapy/immunotherapy, anti-VEGF antibody therapy, particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer) is not clinically adequate to treat the patients or the patients are no longer receiving any beneficial effect from the therapy such that these patients need additional effective therapy. As used herein, the phrase can also refer to a condition of the \"non-responsive/refractory\" patient, e.g., which describe patients who respond to therapy yet suffer from side effects, develop resistance, do not respond to the therapy, do not respond satisfactorily to the therapy, etc. In various embodiments, a cancer is relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced, or has increased, or tumor size has not been significantly reduced, or has increased, or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. The determination of whether the cancer cells are relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells, using the art-accepted meanings of \"relapse\" or \"refractory\" or \"non-responsive\" in such a context. A tumor resistant to anti-VEGF treatment is an example of a relapse tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in a subject by administering one or more anti-EphB4 antibody to block or reduce the relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in subject. In certain embodiments, the antagonist can be administered subsequent to the cancer therapeutic. In certain embodiments, the anti-EphB4 antibody are administered simultaneously with cancer therapy. Alternatively, or additionally, the anti-EphB4 antibody therapy alternates with another cancer therapy, which can be performed in any order. The invention also encompasses methods for administering one or more inhibitory antibodies to prevent the onset or recurrence of cancer in patients predisposed to having cancer. Generally, the subject was or is concurrently undergoing cancer therapy. In one embodiment, the cancer therapy is treatment with an anti-angiogenesis agent, e.g., a VEGF antagonist. The anti-angiogenesis agent includes those known in the art and those found under the Definitions herein. In one embodiment, the anti-angiogenesis agent is an anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment (e.g., humanized A4.6.1, AVASTIN ® (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), Y0317, M4, G6, B20, 2C3, etc.). See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patents 6,582,959\n \n, \n \n6,884,879\n \n, \n \n6,703,020\n \n; \n \nWO98/45332\n \n; \n \nWO 96/30046\n \n; \n \nWO94/10202\n \n; \n \nEP 0666868B1\n \n; \n \nUS Patent Applications 20030206899\n \n, \n \n20030190317,\n \n \n \n20030203409\n \n, and \n \n20050112126\n \n; \nPopkov et al., Journal of Immunological Methods 288:149-164 (2004\n); and, \n \nW02005012359\n \n. Additional agents can be administered in combination with VEGF antagonist and an anti-EphB4 antibody for blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth, e.g., see section entitled Combination Therapies herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody of the invention (and adjunct therapeutic agent) is/are administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition of the invention will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 µg/kg to 15 mg/kg (\ne.g.\n O.lmg/kg-10mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 µg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05mg/kg to about 10mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg, 4.0mg/kg or 10mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, \ne.g.\n every week or every three weeks (\ne.g.\n such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, \ne.g.\n about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-EphB4 antibodies of the invention are useful in assays detecting EphB4 expression (such as diagnostic or prognostic assays) in specific cells or tissues wherein the antibodies are labeled as described below and/or are immobilized on an insoluble matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for detection of EphB4, the methods comprising detecting EphB4-anti-EphB4 antibody complex in the sample. The term \"detection\" as used herein includes qualitative and/or quantitative detection (measuring levels) with or without reference to a control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for diagnosing a disorder associated with EphB4 expression and/or activity, the methods comprising detecting EphB4-anti-EphB4 antibody complex in a biological sample from a patient having or suspected of having the disorder. In some embodiments, the EphB4 expression is increased expression or abnormal (undesired) expression. In some embodiments, the disorder is a tumor, cancer, and/or a cell proliferative disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides any of the anti-EphB4 antibodies described herein, wherein the anti-EphB4 antibody comprises a detectable label.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a complex of any of the anti-EphB4 antibodies described herein and EphB4. In some embodiments, the complex is in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments, the complex comprises a cancer cell. In some embodiments, the anti-EphB4 antibody is detectably labeled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-EphB4 antibodies can be used for the detection of EphB4 in any one of a number of well known detection assay methods. For example, a biological sample may be assayed for EphB4 by obtaining the sample from a desired source, admixing the sample with anti-EphB4 antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody/ EphB4 complex with any EphB4 present in the mixture, and detecting any antibody/ EphB4 complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody/ EphB4 complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include immunohistochemistry, competitive and sandwich assays, and steric inhibition assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical methods for EphB4 all use one or more of the following reagents: labeled EphB4 analogue, immobilized EphB4 analogue, labeled anti-EphB4 antibody, immobilized anti-EphB4 antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as \"tracers.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of EphB4 and anti-EphB4 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay, examples including moieties that may be detected directly, such as fluorochrome, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels, as well as moieties, such as enzymes, that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include: The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of EphB4 and anti-EphB4 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay, examples including moieties that may be detected directly, such as fluorochrome, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels, as well as moieties, such as enzymes, that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456\n \n), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis-imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above-described fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and enzyme labels. See, for example, \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475\n \n (fluorimetry) and \n \n3,645,090\n \n (enzymes); \nHunter et al., Nature, 144: 945 (1962\n); \nDavid et al., Biochemistry, 13: 1014-1021 (1974\n); \nPain et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 40: 219-230 (1981\n); and \nNygren, J. Histochem. and Cytochem., 30: 407-412 (1982\n). Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label, including the enzymes, to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See, for example, \nO'Sullivan et al., \"\nMethods for the Preparation of Enzyme-antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay,\n\" in Methods in Enzymology, ed. J.J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis, Vol. 73 (Academic Press, New York, New York, 1981), pp. 147-166\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti-EphB4 antibody from any EphB4 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-EphB4 antibody or EphB4 analogue before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (\n \nBennich et al.., U.S. 3,720,760\n \n), by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-EphB4 antibody or EphB4 analogue afterward, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression of proteins in a sample may be examined using immunohistochemistry and staining protocols. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing or detecting presence of proteins in a sample. Immunohistochemistry (\"IHC\") techniques utilize an antibody to probe and visualize cellular antigens \nin situ\n, generally by chromogenic or fluorescent methods. For sample preparation, a tissue or cell sample from a mammal (typically a human patient) may be used. Examples of samples include, but are not limited to, cancer cells such as colon, breast, prostate, ovary, lung, stomach, pancreas, lymphoma, and leukemia cancer cells. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to surgical excision, aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment, the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffm or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed (\ni.e.\n preserved) by conventional methodology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used. IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and/or fluorescence \nin-situ\n hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available; direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay, binding of antibody to the target antigen (e.g., EphB4) is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent, such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme-labeled primary antibody, which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay, unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label, a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe primary and/or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAside from the sample preparation procedures discussed above, further treatment of the tissue section prior to, during or following IHC may be desired, For example, epitope retrieval methods, such as heating the tissue sample in citrate buffer may be carried out (see, \ne.g.\n, \nLeong et al. Appl. Immunohistochem. 4(3):201 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing an optional blocking step, the tissue section is exposed to primary antibody for a sufficient period of time and under suitable conditions such that the primary antibody binds to the target protein antigen in the tissue sample. Appropriate conditions for achieving this can be determined by routine experimentation. The extent of binding of antibody to the sample is determined by using any one of the detectable labels discussed above. Preferably, the label is an enzymatic label (e.g. HRPO) which catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate such as 3,3'-diaminobenzidine chromogen. Preferably the enzymatic label is conjugated to antibody which binds specifically to the primary antibody (e.g. the primary antibody is rabbit polyclonal antibody and secondary antibody is goat anti-rabbit antibody).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecimens thus prepared may be mounted and coverslipped. Slide evaluation is then determined, e.g. using a microscope, and staining intensity criteria, routinely used in the art, may be employed. Staining intensity criteria may be evaluated as follows:\n\n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \nStaining Pattern\n \n \n \nScore\n \n \n \n \n \nNo staining is observed in cells.\n \n0\n \n \n \nFaint/barely perceptible staining is detected in more than 10% of the cells.\n \n1+\n \n \n \nWeak to moderate staining is observed in more than 10% of the cells.\n \n2+\n \n \n \nModerate to strong staining is observed in more than 10% of the cells.\n \n3+\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a staining pattern score of about 2+ or higher in an IHC assay is diagnostic and/or prognostic. In some embodiments, a staining pattern score of about 1+ or higher is diagnostic and/or prognostic. In other embodiments, a staining pattern score of about 3 of higher is diagnostic and/or prognostic. It is understood that when cells and/or tissue from a tumor or colon adenoma are examined using IHC, staining is generally determined or assessed in tumor cell and/or tissue (as opposed to stromal or surrounding tissue that may be present in the sample).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther assay methods, known as competitive or sandwich assays, are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer EphB4 analogue to compete with the test sample EphB4 for a limited number of anti-EphB4 antibody antigen-binding sites. The anti-EphB4 antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and EphB4 bound to the anti-EphB4 antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and EphB4. This separation is accomplished by decanting (where the binding partner was preinsolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction). The amount of test sample EphB4 is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose-response curves with known amounts of EphB4 are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of EphB4 present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother species of competitive assay, called a \"homogeneous\" assay, does not require a phase separation. Here, a conjugate of an enzyme with the EphB4 is prepared and used such that when anti-EphB4 antibody binds to the EphB4 the presence of the anti-EphB4 antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case, the EphB4 or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti-EphB4 antibody so that binding of the anti-EphB4 antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method \nper se\n is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low-molecular-weight hapten to a small EphB4 fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti-EphB4 antibody. Under this assay procedure the EphB4 present in the test sample will bind anti-EphB4 antibody, thereby allowing anti-hapten to bind the conjugate, resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten, e.g., a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of EphB4 or anti-EphB4 antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti-EphB4 antibody is used to adsorb test sample EphB4, the test sample is removed as by washing, the bound EphB4 is used to adsorb a second, labeled anti-EphB4 antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample EphB4. In \"simultaneous\" sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti-EphB4. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti-EphB4 antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for EphB4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing are merely exemplary detection assays for EphB4. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti-EphB4 antibody for the determination of EphB4 are included within the scope hereof, including the bioassays described herein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nArticles of Manufacture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided.

It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Generation of anti-EphB4 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-EphB4 antibodies were generated using phage display, using EphB4-His protein to select phage. A variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries from which an antibody of interest can be obtained. One method of generating antibodies of interest is through the use of a phage antibody library as described in \nLee et al., J. Mol. Biol. (2004), 340(5):1073-93\n. Clones selected using phage display were screened against EphB4-His protein using phage ELISA. Unique clones were selected for further characterization by phage competition ELISA and a blocking assay to determine whether the phage antibody clone could block EphB4-ephrinB2 interactions. Clone 30.35 performed favorably and was selected for further analysis. To improve the affinity of clone 30.35, phage display libraries were generated in the background of YW30.35, each targeting selected HVRs for soft or hard randomization. Selected clones were screened by phage ELISA and then expressed as Fab protein and their affinity determined using Biacore. Selected clones were reformatted as full-length IgGs, and their affinity was determined using Biacore. The sequences of parent clone 30.35 and affinity matured clones are shown in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Characterization of anti-EphB4 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the binding affinity of anti-EphB4 Mabs, surface plasmon resonance (SRP) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 was used (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcorc Inc.) were activated with \nN\n-ethyl-\nN'\n- (3-dimcthylaminopropyl)-carbodiimidc hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Anti-EphB4 antibody was diluted with 10mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5ug/ml before injection at a flow rate of 5ul/minute to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU) of coupled antibody. Next, 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of either human or murine EphB4-His molecules (0.7nM to 500nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 at 25°C at a now rate of 25ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 3. \"NA\" signifies that the measurement was not performed.\n\n \nTABLE 3: Binding affinity and kinetics of anti-EphB4 antibodies to human and mouse EphB4.\n \n \n \nAnti-EphB4\n \n \n \n \nmurine antigen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhuman antigen\n \n \n \n \n \n \nkon/10\n5\n \n \nkoff/10\n-4\n \n \nKd(nM)\n \nkon/10\n5\n \n \nkoff/10\n-4\n \n \nKd(nM)\n \n \n \n \nYW30.35\n \n0.31\n \n0.75\n \n2.4\n \n0.03\n \n0.96\n \n32\n \n \n \nYW30.35.1D2\n \n1.28\n \n< 0.05\n \n< 0.04\n \n0.36\n \n< 0.05\n \n< 0.14\n \n \n \nYW30.35.2D8\n \n0.92\n \n< 0.05\n \n< 0.05\n \n0.4\n \n< 0.05\n \n< 0.12\n \n \n \nYW30.35.2D12\n \nNA\n \nNA\n \nNA\n \n0.27\n \n< 0.05\n \n< 0.19\n \n \n \nYM30.35.2D13\n \nNA\n \nNA\n \nNA\n \n0.45\n \n< 0.05\n \n< 0.11\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn different experiments, the cross-reactivity of anti-EphB4 antibody clone 30.35 was tested against other EphB receptors. Briefly, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing full-length human EphB1, human EphB2, human EphB4 or human EphB6. 24 hours after transfection, cells were subjected to FACS analysis to detect binding by anti-EphB4 antibodies, if any. Anti-EphB4 clone 30.35 did not cross-react with human EphB1, human EphB2, human EphB3 or human EphB6.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3: Anti-EphB4 antibody blocked EphB4 receptor signaling in a cell-based assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to demonstrate the ability of anti-EphB4 antibodies to block the interaction of membrane-bound EphrinB2 and EphB4, we performed a cell-based assay in which EphB4 and EphrinB2 were presented by different cell types. 3T3 cells overexpressing human EphrinB2 were used to stimulate HUVEC cells that express high level of EphB4 but low level of EphrinB2, and the ability of anti-EphB4 antibody to inhibit EphB4 activation was tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3T3 cells overexpressing human EphrinB2 were prepared as follows: human full length EphrinB2 was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently used to generate stable cell line with 3T3.Flp cells (Invitrogen) according to manufacture's manual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3T3 cells overexpressing human EphrinB2 were overlayed on HUVEC cells for 15 or 30 minutes, in the presence or absence of anti-EphB4 antibody. Activation of EphB4 receptor was assessed by immunoprecipitating EphB4 protein, then detection of presence or absence of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (antibody 4G10; Upstate) using western blotting. Briefly, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and anti-EphB4 antibody 35.2D8 was added at 5 ug/sample. After incubation at 4C for two hours, the immunocomplex was pulled down using Protein A agarose. EphB4 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western Blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate) at a concentration of 1 ug/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this experiment are shown in \nFigure 7\n. Overlay of 3T3 cells on HUVEC cells caused dramatic tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB4 (\nlane\n 4 and 5). A 30 minute preincubation of HUVECs with anti-EphB4 antibody (clone 35.2D8 at 5 ug/ml) effectively abolished EphB4 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by overlaying 3T3-EphrinB2 cells (lane 6). By contrast, treatment of HUVEC cells with anti-EphB4 alone did not cause EphB4 activation in HUVECs (\nlane\n 2 and 3), and untreated HUVEC cells did not demonstrate EphB4 activation. These results established that anti-EphB4 antibody blocked ligand-receptor interaction in the context of direct cell-cell contact.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, the descriptions and examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following numbered paragraphs, which precede the claims, define further aspects and embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis divisional application is intended to incorporate the entire disclosure of the parent application \n \nEP 07797067.1\n \n, published as \n \nWO2007/130697A2\n \n.

Description\n\n\n\n\n JAK KINASE MODULATING QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AND METHODS\n\n\nOF USE THEREOF\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application nos. 61/156,447, filed February 27, 2009, 61/294,083, filed January 11, 2010 and 61/294,490, filed January 13, 2010. The disclosures of the above referenced applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. FIELD\n\n\n[0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The compounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. BACKGROUND\n\n\n[0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAKl, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNα/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin- 1 (CT-I) (See, Rane, S. G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679).\n\n\n[0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). The family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to \n\n phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become phosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STATl, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. [0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets.\n\n\n[0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in myeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. Exemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of-function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 70, 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng J. Med.

[0073] As used herein, \"isotopic composition\" refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom, and \"natural isotopic composition\" refers to the naturally occurring isotopic composition or abundance for a given atom. Atoms containing their natural isotopic composition may also be referred to herein as \"non- enriched\" atoms. Unless otherwise designated, the atoms of the compounds recited herein are meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. For example, unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \"H\" or \"hydrogen\", the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural isotopic composition. \n\n [0074] As used herein, \"isotopically enriched\" refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \"Isotopically enriched\" may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom.\n\n\n[0075] As used herein, \"isotopic enrichment\" refers to the percentage of incorporation of an amount of a specific isotope at a given atom in a molecule in the place of that atom's natural isotopic abundance. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of the molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. The isotopic enrichment of the compounds provided herein can be determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, Metabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al, J. Nucl Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol Interact. 117: 191 (1999).\n\n\n[00151] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. [00152] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- \n\n determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et ah, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et ah, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol, vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)).\n\n\n[00153] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as T\n2\nO. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\nO or \n18\nO for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects.\n\n\nC.

Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; 5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; 5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; 6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; and 6,699,500.\n\n\n1. Matrix Controlled Release Devices\n\n\n[00207] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999).\n\n\n[00208] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. [00209] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and \n\n scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; polyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. [00210] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device included, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate- methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, and ; hydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially \n\n hydro lyzed polyvinyl acetate,; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides.\n\n\n[00211] In a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions. [00212] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, melt-granulation followed by compression.\n\n\n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices\n\n\n[00213] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s).\n\n\n[00214] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium croscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose \n\n (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate.\n\n\n[00215] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol,; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n[00216] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. [00217] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing.\n\n\n[00218] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), \n\n CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes.\n\n\n[00219] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water- vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. [00220] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post- coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220.\n\n\n[00221] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports.\n\n\n[00222] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n [00223] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J. Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al, Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J. Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). [00224] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,059 and WO 2002/17918. The AMT controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, and a dip- coating method.\n\n\n[00225] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as ESC controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s), a hydroxylethyl cellulose, and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers.\n\n\n3. Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices\n\n\n[00226] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μm to about 3 mm, about 50 μm to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μm to about 1 mm in diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller- compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989.\n\n\n[00227] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, \n\n and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet.\n\n\n4. Targeted Delivery\n\n\n[00228] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated, including liposome-, resealed erythrocyte-, and antibody-based delivery systems.

Cells useful in the assays include cells with wildtype JAK such as TF-I or mutated JAK such as the cell line HEL-2 which express a constitutively active JAK2 carrying the V617F mutation. Suitable cells include those derived through cell culture from patient samples as well as cells derived using routine molecular biology techniques, e.g., retroviral transduction, transfection, mutagenesis, etc.\n\n\nE.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS\n\n\nStarting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g., March Advanced Organic \n\n Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. 300 MHz Proton (\n1\nH) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions (acetonitrile/water, 0.05% acetic acid). Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna C 18, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient containing an increasing composition of organic cosolvent (0.05% HOAc/CH\n3\nCN or 0.05% HOAc/MeOH) to aqueous cosolvent (0.05% aq HOAc). Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash chromatography (Still et al. (1978) J. Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, Biotage SP instrument) using prepacked silica gel columns.\n\n\n[00241] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. [00242] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl {e.g., ?-butyldimethylsilyl, ?-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include ?-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(O)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), p-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n [00243] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T. W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley -Interscience. [00244] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. [00245] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. [00246] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein.\n\n\n[00247] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J. Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows:\n\n\n \n\n [00248] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. Scheme 1 illustrates a general route to key synthetic intermediates and compounds provided herein via substituted anthranilimides 5. Starting from a substituted benzoic acid, nitration under standard conditions, for example, treatment with nitric acid under acidic conditions with heating as necessary, provides the corresponding nitrobenzoic acid 2, which is separated from any undesired regioisomers by chromatography or crystallization. Reduction of the nitro group under standard conditions, for example, using hydrogen gas and noble metal catalyst in a solvent such as water, a lower alcohol, EtOAc, or DMF; metallic Sn or Fe under acid conditions; or SnCl\n2\n in a solvent such as EtOH or DMF, affords the corresponding anthranilic acid 4. Conversion of the carboxyl group of 4 to the carboxamide group of 5 is accomplished by any of a variety of standard methods, including treatment with ammonia or ammonium chloride in the presence of coupling reagents such as HATU, EDCI, (Benzotriazol-1- yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, and the like, or alternatively, via the acid chloride by treatment of the acid with thionyl chloride or phosphoryl chloride or the like, followed by addition of a suitable form of ammonia, such as ammonia in MeOH or ammonium hydroxide. Anthranilamide 5 is then condensed with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 6 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSCl in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxyquinazolines 8. The hydroxyl group of 4-hydroxyquinazoline 8 is next converted to a leaving group. Examples of this transformation include treatment with a halogenating agent such as phosphoryl halide to produce quinazoline 9 (Z = halo), or with a sulfonyl chloride to produce quinazoline 9 (Z = a sulfonyloxy derivative), or with a halogenating agent followed by an organic mercaptan followed by sulfur oxidation to produce compound 7 (Z = a sulfmyl or sulfonyl derivative). Quinazoline 9 is then allowed to react with a suitable pyrazole amine (pyrazole-NH\n2\n) in a suitable solvent such as DMF or dimethylacetamide, optionally in the presence of a source of iodide ion, for example potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide, optionally with heating, to afford, after isolation, compound 10. \n\n Scheme 1 o O O\n\n\n(R\n6\n)n OH\n\n\n \n■\n (R\n6\n)π (R\n6\n)π-\n\n\nNO\n2\n NH\n2\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00249] It is understood that at suitable stages of a synthetic process such as that illustrated in Scheme 1, one or more R\n6\n groups of formulae 1 - 10 may serve as a precursor to a modified R\n6\n group in the final compound provided herein. For example, if in compound 1, R\n6\n = CC^Me, the methoxycarbonyl group may be transformed at a suitable stage of the synthesis, to, for example, a carboxyl group by hydrolysis, to an amide by hydrolysis followed by carboxy group activation and treatment with an amine, to a hydroxymethyl group by reduction, to a tertiary carbinol by treatment with two equivalents of a Grignard reagent, to an aminomethyl group by reduction to a hydroxymethyl group followed by oxidation to an aldehyde followed by reductive amination with a suitable amine in the presence of a selective reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Similarly, if R\n6\n = OCH\n2\nPI1, then R\n6\n may be transformed to OH, by hydrogenolytic cleavage of the benzyl group, followed by alkylation of the resulting phenolic hydroxyl group with an opetionally substituted alkyl halide or an optionally substituted alkyl sulfonate to form a corresponding aromatic ether.\n\n\n[00250] Similarly, certain R groups in intermediates 8, 9, or 10 may be incorporated as shown in Scheme 1 and then converted to alternative R groups. [00251] In Scheme 2, an anthranilamide 5 prepared according to Scheme 1 is treated with an activated oxalic acid derivative such as a dialkyl oxalate either neat or in a suitable solvent such as EtOH or HOAc; or anthranilamide 5 is treated with an \n\n oxalic acid monoalkyl ester chloride in a suitable solvent such as DCM in the presence of a base such as TEA and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as DMAP; or anthranilamide 5 is treated with a cyano oxoacetate monoalkyl ester with heating in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF in the presence of a base such as TEA. Analogously to the methods described in Scheme 1, subsequent treatment of the above products under dehydrating conditions, for example, heating with or without TMSCl in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA in a suitable solvent such as DCE affords the bicyclic product 11. In addition, a slightly modified procedure to intermediates 11 is reported in patent application WO2004/20441, incorporated by reference in its entirety. Conditions for conversion of 11 to 12, conversion of 12 to 13 or 14, and for conversion of 13 to 15 are analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for the analogous transformations. The alkoxycarbonyl group at the 2-position of the quinazoline ring of compound 12 or compound 14 can treated with a metalloarene, for example an aryl lithium or an aryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, to produce ketone 13 or 15, respectively. Although not shown in Scheme 2, intermediate 11 also may be analogously treated with a metalloarene to form the corresponding aryl ketone, which may then be further transformed to 15 by converting the 4-hydroxy group to a leaving group, for example, chloro, followed by displacement of the chloro group with an appropriately substituted 3-aminopyrazole using reagents and conditions analogous to those described for the analogous transformations in Scheme 1. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nM is a metal\n\n\n[00252] Methods are illustrated in Scheme 3 for the conversion of ketones 15 prepared according to Scheme 2 to further compounds provided herein. Treatment of a compound 15 with a suitable reducing agent, for example a hydride reagent such as sodium borohydride in an alcohol solvent, or lithium borohydride in an ether solvent, or a related borohydride or aluminum hydride reagent in an appropriate solvent system, reduces the ketone to the corresponding carbinol 16. Treatment of ketone 15 with an alkyl or aryl lithium or magnesium halide reagent affords a tertiary carbinol 17. Alternatively, treatment of ketone 15 with an O-substituted or O-unsubstituted hydroxylamine in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol or alcohol/water mixture, optionally in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst, affords an oxime 18. The oxime may be further treated under reducing conditions, for example a borane-amine complex in the presence of a strong acid and heat for prolonged reaction times or hydrogeno lysis conditions (H\n2\n, noble metal catalyst, optionally in the presence of an organic or mineral acid) for prolonged periods to afford the amine 19. Alternatively, use of milder conditions such as lower temperature, shorter reaction times or milder acid, when present, afford the alkoxylamine or hydroxylamine 20. \n\n Scheme 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n[00253] Alternatively, amines 19 may be prepared according to the synthetic sequence illustrated in Scheme 4. In Scheme 4, the hydroxyl group in carbinol 16 is converted to a leaving group Z by treatment with, for example, a phosphorus halide to afford compound 21 (Z = halo) or by treatment with a sulfonyl halide in a suitable solvent such as DCM and in the presence of a hydrogen halide scavenger such as a tertiary amine, for example DIEA or pyridine, to afford compound 21 (Z = a sulfonyloxy derivative). For the last reaction, in the event of adventitious sulfonylation at one or more other sites of the molecule, the extraneous sulfonyl \n\n groups are removed at a later stage by treatment with a nucleophile such as hydroxide, ammonia, or hydrazine.\n\n\n[00254] As shown in Scheme 4, intermediate 21 is further transformed to an azide 22 by displacement of leaving group Z with azide ion, for example by treatment of 21 with an alkali metal azide in a suitable solvent such as a dipolar aprotic solvent, for example DMF or DMSO, at a temperature between about 0 \n0\nC and about 100 \n0\nC. Reduction of the azide with a reducing system, for example triphenylphosphine followed by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis conditions (H\n2\n, noble metal catalyst) in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol or DMF, affords amine 23. [00255] Scheme 4 also illustrates that amines 23 can be further modified to form products of the invention 24, where one of the hydrogen atoms of the amino group has been substituted with a group R\n14\n. Treatment of amine 23 with an acylating agent such as an acid chloride or acid anhydride usually in the presence of base and optionally in the presence of an acylation catalyst such as DMAP or pyridine in a suitable solvent such as EtOAc, DCM, DMF, or THF, affords products 24 (R\n14\n = acyl). Alternatively, amine 23 is treated with an alkyl chloroformate, for example ethyl or isopropyl chloroformate, in the presence of base and optionally in the presence of an acylation catalyst such as DMAP or pyridine in a suitable solvent such as EtOAc, DCM, DMF, or THF to afford the corresponding carbamate 24 (R\n14\n =- C(O)OR\n12\n). Alternatively, amine 23 is treated with a sulfonyl halide, for example methane or benzene sulfonyl chloride, in the presence of base and optionally in the presence of an acylation catalyst such as DMAP or pyridine in a suitable solvent such as EtOAc, DCM, DMF, or THF to afford the corresponding sulfonamide 23 (R\n14\n = - SO\n2\nR\n12\n). Alternatively, amine 23 in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or DME is treated with an aldehyde under dehydrating conditions, for example in the presence of molecular sieves or trimethyl orthoformate, optionally in the presence of an acid catalyst such as acetic acid or hydrochloric acid to form an intermediate imine, and the mixture is treated either concurrently or subsequently with a selective reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or (especially in the case of pretreatment with aldehyde) sodium borohydride to afford a new amine 23 (R\n14\n = alkyl or aryl, each of which is optionally substituted). \n\n Scheme 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n23\n\n\n[00256] A representative method is illustrated in Scheme 5 for the conversion of ketone 15 to additional compounds provided herein. Ketone 15 in a suitable solvent such as THF, DME, diglyme, or DMSO is treated with the anion generated from treatment of a trialkylphosphonoacetate with a strong base such as sodium hydride, a lithium amide, dimsyl (DMSO) anion, or the like, at a suitable temperature between about 0 \n0\nC and about 100 \n0\nC to provide, following work-up and isolation, α,β- unsaturated ester 25. Treatment of compound 25 under suitable reducing conditions, for example with H\n2\n in the presence of a noble metal catalyst in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol or DMF affords ester 26. Reduction of the ester moiety of compound 19 may be effected by treatment with a hydride reducing system such as LiALH\n4\n/THF, LiBH\n4\n/THF, or Ca(BH\n4\n)\n2\n/Et0H/THF to afford primary alcohol 27. The hydroxyl group of alcohol 27 is converted to a leaving group Z using method well known in the art, for example treatment of 20 with a phosphoryl halide to afford 28 (Z = halide) or treatment of 27 with a sulfonyl halide to afford 28 (Z = a sulfonyloxy derivative). Intermediate 28 may then been treated with a nucleophile to afford compound 29. For example, treatment of compound 28 with a mercaptide nucleophile affords compound 29 (Y = S); treatment of compound 28 with an alkoxide nucleophile affords 29 (Y = O); treatment of compound 28 with an amine nucleophile affords compound 29 (Y = NH or NR\nX\n). \n\n Scheme 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00257] A complementary approach to convertion of alcohol 27 to compounds provided herein is illustrated in Scheme 6. Alcohol 27 is first treated with a suitable oxidizing system such as pyridinium chlorochromate/DCM or Swern reagent (DMSO/oxalyl chloride/TEA/DCM) or DMSO/pyridine-sulfur trioxide complex/TEA or Dess-Martin periodinane (l,l,l-trisacetoxy)-l,l-dihydro-l,2-benziodoxol-3-(lH)- one/DCM) to afford aldehyde 30. Treatment of aldehyde 30 with a primary or secondary amine in the presence of a selective reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol, optionally in the presence of catalytic a catalytic quantity acid such as acetic acid, affords amine 31. \n\n Scheme 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n[00258] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage (See, Fabian et al. or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for \n\n 30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- well plates in a final volume of 34 μL, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 μL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (Ix PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (Ix PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, SlO, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μM) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the 321 distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants.\n\n\n[00444] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μM against JAK2.

The animals received a boost at Day 6. Caliper measures of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints were done on Day 8. Upon onset of arthritis (Day 9), the rats were randomized into treatment groups of 8 animals per each arthritic group (with 4 animals having been initially reserved for the normal control group). Starting on Day 9, a compound of Formula I was diluted in Pharmatek#6 and treatment was initiated with the oral administration of a compound of Formula I at 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg BID at 12 hour intervals or at 60 mg/kg QD. The control arthritic groups included a vehicle control, a water control, a no treatment control and a positive control group given an oral administration of dexamethasone at 0.03 mg/kg QD. Treatment continued for a total of 6 days. Caliper measurements of the ankles were taken every day starting from Day 9 through Day 16. Results of the assay are provided in Figure 1. [00452] An exemplary compound of Formula I provided a statistically significant improvement in ankle thickness at >5 mg/kg BID as early as treatment Day 2. \n\n Maximum efficacy for the compound in the CIA rat model was observed at 60 mg/kg (QD or BID). A correlation between the clinical paw swelling score and histology was observed.\n\n\n[00453] Effect of the treatment on body weight of rats was measured from Day 9 through Day 16 as percent change in the body weight from the baseline. Results are provided in Figure 2.\n\n\nExample 82\n\n\nIn vivo efficacy study in the mouse TELJAK mouse model [00454] This study was conducted to determine the effect of a selected compound of Formula I on tumor progression and survival. CB 17 SCID mice (Harlan Laboratories) were inoculated with 5e5 TEL-JAK cells via tail vein on day 0. Cells were allowed to establish in the animal, and on day 3, dosing was initiated as follows: Vehicle (Pharmatek#6) administered 50 uL at BID to a first group, Ambit Internal Compound prepared in Pharmatek #6 and administered at 50 mg/kg BID to a second group and TGENl 01348 prepared in Pharmatek #6 to a third group at 100 mg/kg BID. Each treatment group (16 animals per group) received a twice daily dosing for a two week period. An untreated group of 10 animals also served as control. Figure 3 shows the results of the Kaplan Meier survival analysis.\n\n\n[00455] A second study was conducted using the same protocol, with the same controls and the following treatment groups: Ambit Internal Compound A prepared in Pharmatek #6 administered at 60 mg/kg BID and a selected compound of Formula I prepared in Pharmatek#6 at 60 mg/kg BID. Figure 4 shows the results of the Kaplan Meier survival analysis.\n\n\n[00456] The data shows that Ambit Internal Compound provides greater than 70% increased life span (ILS) while TGEN101348 provides 30% ILS. The selected compound of Formula I is shown to perform better than Ambit Internal Compound and is therefore expected to perform better than TGENlO 1348 preclinically.\n\n\nExample 83\n\n\nIn vivo efficacy study in the mouse HELV617F liquid tumor mouse model [00457] This study was conducted to determine the effect of a selected compound of Formula I on tumor progression and survival. CB 17 SCID mice (Charles River Labs) were pretreated with cyclophosphamide IP QD at 150 mg/kg for two \n\n consecutive days before being injected with cells. On Day 0, 75 mice were inoculated IV with 5e6 HEL 92.1.7 cells suspended in sterile saline. Animals were weighed on Day 8, and assigned to groups with similar mean body weights and similar standard deviations from the mean. Animals were dosed on Day 8 for a 21 day dosing period. Treatment groups were as follows (10 animals per group): First group was administered vehicle (Pharmatek#6), PO, BID; a second group was administered Ambit Internal Compound A prepared in Pharmatek#6, at 50 mg/kg PO, BID; and a third group was administered TGENlO 1348 prepared in Pharmatek#6, at 120 mg/kg PO, BID. An untreated group of 10 animals also served as control. Figure 5 shows the results of the Kaplan Meier analysis.\n\n\n[00458] Another study was conducted using the same protocol, with the same controls and the following treatment groups: Ambit Internal Compound A prepared in Pharmatek #6 administered at 60 mg/kg BID and a selected compound of Formula I prepared in Pharmatek#6 at 60 mg/kg BID. Figure 6 shows the results of the Kaplan Meier analysis. Figures 5 and 6 show that the Ambit Internal Compound and the selected compound of Formula I provide approximately a 30% increased life span (ILS) while TGEN101348 provides no survival benefit (approximately 5% ILS).\n\n\nExample 84 Other cell-based assays\n\n\n[00459] Compounds of Formula I were also tested in other cell-based assays, for example, pSTAT5 electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (Meso Scale Discovery) in csTF-1 and HEL cell lines, and found to be potent in those assays. The effects of the compounds of Formula I on BaF3 cell proliferation were also tested using the CellTiter-Blue® assay (Promega).\n\n\nInhibition of DTH response to Ovalbumin in CD-I mice\n\n\n[00460] A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a compound of Formula I in a mouse model of ovalbumin- induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (type IV hypersensitivity, DTH) using two dosing schedules. Delayed-type hypersensitivity is characterized by antigen specific T-cell production of cytokines, resulting in increased vascular permeability, infiltration by mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells, edema and induration. Primary exposure to antigen (sensitization phase) elicits \n\n development of antigen specific memory T-cells that are activated upon secondary exposure (challenge).\n\n\n[00461] The biphasic nature of Type IV hypersensitivity provides a model to differentiate the immunopharmacological activity of compounds with immunomodulatory properties. Compounds that are immunosuppressive (suppress the primary immune response) would be expected to be effective when administered during the sensitization phase. Compounds that are anti-inflammatory would be expected to be effective when administered during the recall phase, preventing or down regulating the antigen recognition and/or activation of memory T-cells, or by interrupting the secondary signaling cascades induced by T-cell produced cytokines and growth factors (thereby reducing/preventing increased vascular permeability and inflammatory cell motility/recruitment). Compounds that are immunostimulatory would be expected to increase the DTH response when administered during sensitization (increased antigen presentation or memory T-cell expansion), or during recall phase (increased T-cell activation and cytokine/chemokine production, and/or inflammatory cell motility/recruitment/activation).\n\n\n[00462] Since modifications will be apparent to those of skill in the art, it is intended that the claimed subject matter be limited only by the scope of the appended claims."
