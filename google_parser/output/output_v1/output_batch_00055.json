A method for treating obesity in a subject in need thereof which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of \nclaim 1\n, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to aryl indole derivatives useful as medicaments. The compounds act as human QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonists, and are useful as preventive or remedy for obesity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nQRFP43, a peptide of 43 amino acids, has been reported as an endogenous ligand of QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) through bioinformatics and reverse pharmacology (2003), and it was first isolated from rat brains in 2006 (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1). There are also reports that, for example, 26RFa, a close relative of QRFP43, binds to QRFP43 receptor, and has activity similar to that of QRFP43 (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 and 2). QRFP43 is expressed at high level in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, and has a diversity of functions in the body. Specifically, QRFP43 acts as a centrally-acting appetite promoter, and promotes prominent fat accumulation through secretion of various hormones or actions of the nervous system. It is known that intracerebroventricular successive administration of QRFP43 induces obesity and insulin resistance based on these actions. QRFP43 is also involved in hormone secretion such as in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functions of QRFP43 or 26RFa are expressed upon binding to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) present in the central or peripheral nervous system. It would therefore be possible to inhibit the functional expression of QRFP43 or 26RFa by inhibiting the binding of QRFP43 or 26RFa to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds relating to aryl indole derivatives of the present invention can be found in, for example, Patent Document 3. However, the compounds described in this publication have structures that require an amino group at position 7 of the indole, and therefore differ from the compounds of the present invention which do not have an amino group at position 7 of the indole. Further, the compounds of the foregoing publication are cell necrosis factor inhibitors, and are not described as the QRFP43 receptor antagonists as in the present invention. Further, to date, there has been no report of low molecular QRFP43 receptor antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-Patent Document 1: \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, \nVol. 103, pp. 7438-7443, (2006)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent Document 1: WO001/16316\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent Document 2: WO005/65702\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent Document 3: WO009/25478\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblems that the Invention is to Solve\n\n\n \n \n \nBecause the inhibition of the QRFP43 or 26RFa binding to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) can inhibit the functional expression of QRFP43 or 26RFa, a substance antagonistic to the QRFP43 binding to the QRFP43 receptor (GPR103) is expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of various diseases involving QRFP43 or 26RFa, including, for example, cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, arterial sclerosis, renal disease, heart disease, and angiospasm; bulimia; and metabolic disease such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, abnormal hormone secretion, hypercholesteremia, hyperlipidemia, gout, and fatty liver. Such a substance can therefore be provided as a preventive or remedy for, for example, pain, abnormal circadian rhythms, atherosclerosis, obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesteremia, cardiovascular disease (for example, such as coronary artery heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and sudden death), pain, osteoporosis-related disease, lower back pain, and anesthetic hypersensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an antagonist for QRFP43 receptor (GPR103), which is useful as a preventive or remedy for diseases such as above.\n\n\n \nMeans for Solving the Problems\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter intensive studies, the inventors of the present invention have found that compounds including a benzene ring or a specific heteroaryl ring substituting at position 2 of an indole skeleton have an excellent human QRFP receptor (GPR103) antagonist activity. The present invention was completed based on this finding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the present invention provides,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) A compound represented by a formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nrepresents a hydrogen atom, halogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, haloC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, or haloC\n1-6\nalkyloxy;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nrepresents C\n1-6\nalkyl or haloC\n1-6\nalkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3 \nrepresents a hydrogen atom, C\n1-6\nalkyl, or haloC\n1-6\nalkyl; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr represents an aryl or heteroaryl, wherein the aryl or the heteroaryl may be substituted with 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, haloC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, haloC\n1-6\nalkyloxy, hydroxy, amino, monoC\n1-6\nalkylamino, diC\n1-6\nalkylamino, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonylamino, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyloxy, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonylamino, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, carbamoyl, monoC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyl, diC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyl, carbamoylamino, monoC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoylamino, diC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoylamino, monoC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, diC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, carbamoyloxy, monoC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyloxy, diC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyloxy, C\n1-6\nalkylsulfonyl, C\n1-6\nalkylsulfonylamino, C\n1-6\nalkylsulfonyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, sulfamoyl, monoC\n1-6\nalkylsulfamoyl, diC\n1-6\nalkylsulfamoyl, sulfamoylamino, monoC\n1-6\nalkylsulfamoylamino, diC\n1-6\nalkylsulfamoylamino, monoC\n1-6\nalkylsulfamoyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, and diC\n1-6\nalkylsulfamoyl(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) A pharmaceutical composition which contains a compound of (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) A remedy for obesity, which contains a compound of (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient.\n\n\n \nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is described below in more detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the “halogen” include fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “C\n1-6\nalkyl” includes straight-chain alkyls having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and branched alkyls having 3 to 6 carbon atoms.
