Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to novel pyridazine derivatives and analogues thereof, which inhibit factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, compositions containing them, and pyridozines, for the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThromboembolic diseases remain the leading cause of death in developed countries despite the availability of anticoagulants such as warfarin (COUMADIN\n®\n), heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and synthetic pentasaccharides and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel (PLAVIX\n®\n). The oral anticoagulant warfarin, inhibits the post-translational maturation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X and prothrombin, and has proven effective in both venous and arterial thrombosis. However, its usage is limited due to its narrow therapeutic index, slow onset of therapeutic effect, numerous dietary and drug interactions, and a need for monitoring and dose adjustment. Thus discovering and developing safe and efficacious oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of thromboembolic disorders has become increasingly important.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne approach is to inhibit thrombin generation by targeting the inhibition of coagulation factor XIa (FXIa). Factor XIa is a plasma serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation, which is initiated \nin vivo\n by the binding of tissue factor (TF) to factor VII (FVII) to generate factor VIIa (FVIIa). The resulting TF:FVIIa complex activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX) that leads to the production of factor Xa (FXa). The generated FXa catalyzes the transformation of prothrombin into small amounts of thrombin before this pathway is shut down by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The process of coagulation is then further propagated via the feedback activation of Factors V, VIII and XI by catalytic amounts of thrombin. (\nWalsh, P.N., Thromb. Haemostasis 1999, 82:234-242\n.) The resulting burst of thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin that polymerizes to form the structural framework of a blood clot, and activates platelets, which are a key cellular component of coagulation (\nHoffman, M., Blood Reviews 2003, 17:51-SS\n). Therefore, factor XIa plays a key role in propagating this amplification loop and is thus an attractive target for anti-thrombotic therapy.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel pyridazine derivatives and analogues thereof, which are useful as selective inhibitors of serine protease enzymes, especially factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides processes and intermediates for making the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharniaceutically acceptable salts, solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provide compounds for a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, , for use in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides the use of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other features of the invention will be set forth in expanded form as the disclosure continues.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nI.

Also included are fused ring and spiro compounds containing, for example, the above heterocycles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"bicyclic heterocycle\" or \"bicyclic heterocyclic group\" is intended to mean a stable 9 or 10-membered heterocyclic ring system which contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a 5 or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic ring comprising a 5 membered heteroaryl ring, a 6-membered heteroaryl ring or a benzo ring, each fused to a second ring. The second ring is a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated, and comprises a 5 membered heterocycle, a 6 membered heterocycle or a carbocycle (provided the first ring is not benzo when the second ring is a carbocycle).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bicyclic heterocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The bicyclic heterocyclic group described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of a bicyclic heterocyclic group are, but not limited to, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, 1H-indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-quinolinyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranyl, chromanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalinyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinazolinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"aromatic heterocyclic group\" or \"heteroaryl\" is intended to mean stable monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that include at least one heteroatom ring member such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Heteroaryl groups include, without limitation, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, furyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, indolyl, pyrroyl, oxazolyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, benzthiazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, indazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, purinyl, carbazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolinyl, benzodioxolanyl, and benzodioxane.

The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (\ni.e.\n, N→O and S(O)p, wherein p is 0, 1 or 2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more atoms (\ni.e.\n, C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Examples of bridged rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"counterion\" is used to represent a negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a dotted ring is used within a ring structure, this indicates that the ring structure may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, the term \"substituted\" means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (\ni.e.\n, =O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. When a ring system (\ne.g.\n, carbocyclic or heterocyclic) is said to be substituted with a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is intended that the carbonyl group or double bond be part (\ni.e.\n, within) of the ring. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (\ne.g.\n, C=C, C=N, or N=N).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (\ne.g.\n, amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (\ne.g.\n, mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. In cases in which there are quaternary carbon atoms in compounds of the present invention, these can be replaced by silicon atoms, provided they do not form Si-N or Si-O bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R\n3a\n, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R\n3a\n groups, and at each occurrence R\n3a\n is selected independently from the definition of R\n3a\n. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1990\n, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms.

Parenteral administration may be used where the ester \nper se\n is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable \nesters\n of compounds of formula I include C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C\n1-6\n alkanoyloxy-C\n1-6\nalkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C\n1-6\nalkoxycarbonyloxy-C\n1-6\nalkyl (e.g. methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for example, \nMedicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, ed.

Such \"substantially pure\" compounds are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Stable compound\" and \"stable structure\" are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. It is preferred that compounds of the present invention do not contain a N-halo, S(O)\n2\nH, or S(O)H group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates.

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is \nGreene and Wuts (Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, Wiley-Interscience, 3rd Edition, 1999\n).\n\n\n \nSYNTHESIS\n\n\n \n \n \nAll references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. Methods for synthesis of a large variety of substituted pyridazines and compounds useful as starting materials for the preparation of compounds of the present invention are well known in the art. (For examples of methods useful for the preparation of pyridazine starting materials see: \nPyridazines in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Castle, R.N., Ed.; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 1973, Vol. 28\n.; \nThe Pyridazines in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Brown, D.J., Ed.; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 2000; Vol. 57, Supplement 1\n; \nComprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, Vol. 6, Boulton, A.J., Ed., Elsevier Science Inc., New York, 1996, pp. 1-93\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative pyridazine compounds of this invention can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Using a modification of the Minisci reaction described by \nCowden (Org. Lett. 2003, 5:4497-4499\n), a Cbz-protected amino acid 1a and 3,6-dichloropyridazine 1b can be coupled at elevated temperature in the presence of silver nitrate, ammonium persulfate, and an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, in a solvent, such as water or a water/dimethylformamide mixture, to give 1c. Pyridazinone 1d can also be formed under the reaction conditions as a side product. Suzuki coupling of either 1c or 1d with a suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl boronic acid or ester 1e in the presence of a base such as potassium phosphate, in a solvent such as dioxane, using a precatalyst system such as \nbis\n(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium(0) and tri-\nt-\nbutylphosphine provides either 1f or 1g. Deprotection of the Cbz group under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as methanol can be used to generate either amine 1h or 1m. Amide coupling between either 1h or 1m and an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid 1j, employing suitable coupling reagents, such as EDCI, HOBt, and base generates either 1n or 1o (for alternative coupling reagents see: \nHan, S-Y; Kim, Y-A. Tetrahedron 2004, 60:2447\n). Alternately, amines 1h or 1m can be coupled with an activated carboxylic ester 1k in the presence of a base such as Hunig's base and in a solvent such as dimethylformamide to give 1n or 1o. Further manipulation of functional groups on R\n3\n using methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis will give additional compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that other suitably protected amino acids can be employed in the Minisci reaction as described in Scheme 1. For instance the Cbz protecting group in 1 a can be replaced with a phthalimide protecting group. Deprotection of the phthalimide moiety can be accomplished with hydrazine in ethanol at elevated temperature.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pyridazine compounds of this invention can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1B. When unsymmetrical pyridazines 1p (R\n4\n ≠ Cl) are used in the Minisci reaction, regioisomers 1q and 1r are generated in varying ratios. Compounds of the formulae 1q can be converted to 1s according to Scheme 1.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention wherein R\n11\n is -CH\n2\nC(O)NR\n8\nR\n9\n can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 2. Deprotection of 2a, prepared according to Scheme 1, with trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane provides acid 2b. Amide coupling between 2b and a suitably substituted amine 2c, employing suitable amide coupling reagents as described in Scheme 1, provides 2d.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention wherein R\n11\n is -CH\n2\nNHC(O)R\nc\n or -CH\n2\nNHR\n7\n can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 3. Deprotection of 3a, prepared according to Scheme 1, with trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane, provides amine 3b. Amide coupling between 3b and a suitably substituted carboxylic acid 3c, or the corresponding activated carboxylic ester, acid chloride or anhydride, employing suitable amide coupling reagents as described in Scheme 1, provides 3d. Reductive amination of 3b and a suitably substituted aldehyde 3e or ketone with a metal hydride such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a solvent mixture such as dichloromethane and dimethylformamide provides 3f.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pyridazine compounds of this invention can be prepared as shown in Scheme 4. A suitably protected amino ester 4a can be converted to the corresponding β-ketophosphonate 4b by treatment with lithium dimethylmethylphosphonate. The pyridazinone ring system can then be prepared in a one pot, two-step sequence. Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of 4b and a suitably substituted oc-ketoester 4c, which is either commercially available or prepared using a modified procedure described by \nDomagala (Tetrahedron Lett. 21:4997-5000\n), in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran gives α,β-unsaturated ketone derivative which can then be condensed with a suitably substituted hydrazine derivative, to give pyridazinone 4d. Deprotection of 4d with trifluoroacetic acid provides the amine which can be coupled with 1j or 1k, according to Scheme 1, to provide 4e. Pyridazinone 4d, when R\n12\n = H, can be treated with phosphorus oxychloride to give Boc-deprotected chloropyridazine 4f. Amide coupling between amine 4f and 1j or 1k, employing suitable amide coupling reagents as described in Scheme 1, provides 4g.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of R\n4\n groups can be introduced to the pyridazine ring as described in Scheme 5. Hydrogenolysis of 4f, as described in Scheme 1, provides the des-chloro derivative which can be coupled with 1j or 1k to give 5a. The chloro in 4f can be displaced with alcohols and thiols in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide to give, after coupling with 1j or 1k, compounds 5b. Alternately, the chloro in 4f can be displaced with amines to give, after coupling with 1j or 1k, additional compounds of 5b. Protection of 4f with Boc\n2\nO, followed by Suzuki coupling with boronic acid 5c, employing reagents described in Scheme 1, gives 5d. Deprotection and amide coupling with 1j or 1k, employing suitable amide coupling reagents as described in Scheme 1, provides 5e. Further manipulation of functional groups using methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis will give additional compounds of the invention.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional R\n4\n and R\n12\n groups can be introduced on the pyridazine ring as described in Scheme 6. Deprotonation ofpyridazinone 4d with a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as THF or DMF and quenching with an alkyl halide, R\n12\n-X, gives the N-alkyl derivative and subsequent deprotection provides amine 6a. Amide coupling between amine 6a and 1j or 1k, employing suitable amide coupling reagents as described in Scheme 1, provides 6b. Pyridazinone 4d can be converted to the triflate 6c with trifluromethanesulfonic anhydride in the presence of a base such as pyridine and in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Palladium-catalyzed carbonylation of triflate 6c, followed by deprotection, gives amine 6d. Amide coupling between amine 6d and 1j or 1k, employing suitable amide coupling reagents as described in Scheme 1, provides 6e. Further manipulation of functional groups using methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis will give additional compounds of the invention.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxylic acid intermediates of formulae 1j, where L\n1\n = -CH\n2\nCH\n2\n- and -CH=CH-, useful for preparation of amide compounds of this invention can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 7.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxylic acid intermediates of formulae 1j, where L\n1\n = -C≡C-, useful for preparation of amide compounds of this invention can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 8.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxylic acid intermediates of formulae 1j, where L\n1\n = -OCH\n2\n- and -S(O)\np\nCH\n2\n-, useful for preparation of amide compounds of this invention can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 9.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional starting materials useful for the preparation of the substituted phenyl acrylic or propanoic acids shown in Schemes 7, 8, and 9, wherein R\n2\n is 1-tetrazolyl,, can be prepared from the corresponding anilines by treatment with sodium azide and trimethylorthoformate in acetic acid as shown in Scheme 10.\n\n \n \n\nX = Br, I, OH, or CO\n2\nH\n\nR\n1a\n = H or halogen\n\nR\n1b\n = halogen or alkyl\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention wherein L\n1\n is -CH\n2\nNH- may be prepared as outlined in Scheme 11. Condensation of an appropriately functionalized amine 11a, prepared as described above, with a suitably substituted isocyanate 11 b in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride, in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or potassium carbonate, provides ureas of formula 11 c. Alternatively, ureas of formula 11 c of this invention can be prepared by condensation of an amine 11 a with carbonyldiimidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide followed by treatment \nin situ\n with a suitably substituted amine 11d. Urea linked compounds of this invention of formula 11c can also be prepared by condensation of amine intermediate 11a with p-nitrophenylchloroformate in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine, followed by treatment of the resulting \np\n-nitrophenylcarbamate with an appropriately substituted amine 11d.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsocyanates of formula 11b used in Scheme 11 are either commercially available or can be readily prepared from the corresponding amines 11d by treatment with phosgene or by various other methods known in the art (see for example, \nH. Eckert and B. Forster, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1987, 26:894\n; \nH. Knolker and T. Braxmeier, Synlett 1997, 925\n; \nS. Porwanski et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45:5027\n). Amines of formula 11d are also available commercially or can be prepared by those knowledgeable in the art from a variety of easily accessible starting materials such as nitriles, aldehydes, alcohols, halides, acids and esters by methods including, but not limited to those outlined in Scheme 12.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nChiral amino acids useful for the synthesis of pyridazine and pyridazinone compounds of this invention are either commercially available or can be prepared by any of a number of methods known in the art. For example, as shown in Scheme 13, didehydroamino acid derivatives of formula 13c may be reduced to provide protected (\nS\n)-amino acids of formula 13d by hydrogenation in the presence of a chiral catalyst such as (\nS\n,\nS\n)-EtDuPhosRh(I) using a modified procedure of \nBurk (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113:8518\n). Didehydroamino acid derivatives of formula 13c can be prepared via several methods, such as for example, a Heck coupling between an aryl iodide, bromide, or tosylate of formula 13a and Boc didehydroalanine benzyl ester, using a modified procedure of \nCarlstrom et al. (Synthesis 1989, 414\n). Alternatively, protected didehydroaminoacids of formula 13c may be prepared by Horner-Emmons type condensation of an aldehyde of formula 13b with Boc-methyl-2-(dimethylphosphono)glycinate, using modifications of literature procedures (\nWang et al., Tetrahedron 2002, 58:3101\n). Protected amino acids of formula 13d may also be prepared by alkylation of methyl 2-(diphenylmethyleneamino)acetate with an appropriately substituted benzyl bromide in the presence of a chiral cinchonidinium catalyst in a suitable solvent, such as methylene chloride, using a procedure similar to that described by \nO'Donnell et al. (Tetrahedron 1999, 55:6347\n), followed by mild acidic workup and reprotection of the amino functionality with a Boc group according to methods known to one skilled in the art. Substitution of heteroaryl bromides or iodides for 13a, heteroaryl, heterocyclic, or alkyl aldehydes for 13b, and heteroarylalkyl or alkylbromides for 13e in Scheme 13 would lead to additional chiral amino acids useful for the synthesis of pyridazine and pyridazinone compounds of this invention. For example, optionally substituted pyrazole carbaldehydes may be used in place of benzaldehydes 13b to give compounds of this invention wherein R\n11\n is an optionally substituted pyrazolylmethyl group.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases where suitably substituted boronic acids are not commercially available, a modification to this approach may be adopted wherein an aryl halide is subjected to a palladium mediated coupling with a diboron species such as bis(pinacolato) diboron to provide the corresponding 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane intermediate using the method of \nIshiyama, T. et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60(23):7508-7510\n). Alternately, this same intermediate can be prepared by reaction of the intermediate halide with the corresponding dialkoxyhydroborane as described by \nMurata et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62(19):6458-6459\n). The boron pinacolate intermediates can be used in place of boronic acids for coupling to the aryl/heteroaryl halides or triflates or the boron pinacolate intermediate can be converted to the boronic acids. Alternately, the corresponding boronic acids can be prepared by metal-halogen exchange of the aryl/heteroaryl halide, quenching with a trialkoxyborate reagent, and aqueous workup to provide the boronic acids (\nMiyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. Chem. Review 1995, 95:2457\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Scheme 14 describes the synthesis of a specific example of R\n3\n-B(OR)\n2\n (1e) when R\n3\n is a 4-hydroxy quinolinone moiety. Intramolecular Friedel-Craft acylation of 14a in the presence of an acid, such as polyphosphoric acid (PPA), at elevated temperature provides the 4-hydroxy quinolinone derivative 14b. Aryl bromide 14b is then subjected to a palladium mediated coupling with a diboron species such as bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron to provide the corresponding boronate 14c using the method of \nIshiyama, T. et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60(23):7508-7510\n). The boronate can be used in place of boronic acids for coupling to the aryl/heteroaryl halides or triflates or the boronate can be converted to the boronic acid.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also realized that the scope of intermediate synthesis can be further extended outside the use of Suzuki methodology since the precursor aryl halides described above are also precursors for Stille, Negishi, Hiyama, and Kumada-type cross coupling methodologies (\nTsuji, J., Transition Metal Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 2000\n; \nTsuji, J., Palladium Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of manipulation of functional groups on R\n3\n using methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis are shown in Scheme 15. Heating 15a with hydrazine monohydrate in n-butanol gives the 3-aminoindazole 15b. Reacting 15a with acetohydroxamic acid and potassium \ntert\n-butoxide in DMF according to a modified procedure described by \nPalermo (Tetrahedron Letters 1996, 37(17):2885\n) provides 3-aminobenzisoxazole 15c. Alternately, heating 15a with formamidine acetate in DMA, according to a modified procedure described by \nLam (J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46:4405\n) gives 4-amino quinazoline 15d.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be recognized that additional deprotection steps and further functional group manipulations of compounds obtained via Schemes 1-15 above using methods known in the art will then provide additional compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following experimental procedures, solution ratios express a volume relationship, unless stated otherwise. NMR chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of intermediates and final products was carried out via either normal or reverse phase chromatography. Normal phase chromatography was carried out using prepacked SiO\n2\n cartridges eluting with gradients of hexanes and ethyl acetate unless otherwise indicated. Reverse phase preparative HPLC was carried out using C18 columns eluting with gradients of solvent A (90% water, 10% methanol, 0.1% TFA) and solvent B (10% water, 90% methanol, 0.1% TFA, UV 220 nm) or with gradients of solvent A (90% water, 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) and solvent B (10% water, 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, UV 220 nm) or with gradients of solvent A (98% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA) and solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.05% TFA, UV 254 nm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, analysis of final products was carried out by reverse phase analytical HPLC using the Waters SUNFIRE™ column (3.5 µm C18, 4.6 x 150 mm). Gradient elution (1.0 mL/min) from 10-100% solvent B for 10 min and then 100% solvent B for 5 min was used. Solvent A is (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA) and solvent B is (5% water, 95% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA, UV 254 nm). Method B: Agilent Zorbax (3.5 µm C18, 4.6x75 mm) eluted at 2.5 mL/min with an 8 min gradient from 100% A to 100% B (A: 10% methanol, 89.9% water, 0. 1 % H3PO\n4\n; B: 10% water, 89.9% methanol, 0. 1 % H\n3\nPO\n4\n, UV 220 nm).\n\n\n \nIV. BIOLOGY\n\n\n \n \n \nWhile blood coagulation is essential to the regulation of an organism's hemostasis, it is also involved in many pathological conditions. In thrombosis, a blood clot, or thrombus, may form and obstruct circulation locally, causing ischemia and organ damage. Alternatively, in a process known as embolism, the clot may dislodge and subsequently become trapped in a distal vessel, where it again causes ischemia and organ damage. Diseases arising from pathological thrombus formation are collectively referred to as thromboembolic disorders and include acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, thrombosis in the cavity of the heart, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, transient ischemic attack, and pulmonary embolism. In addition, thrombosis occurs on artificial surfaces in contact with blood, including catheters, stents, and artificial heart valves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conditions contribute to the risk of developing thrombosis. For example, alterations of the vessel wall, changes in the flow of blood, and alterations in the composition of the vascular compartment. These risk factors are collectively known as Virchow's triad. (\nHemostasis and Thrombosis, Basic Principles and Clinical Practice, 5th Edition, p. 853, 2006, edited by Colman, R.W. et al. published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic agents are frequently given to patients at risk of developing thromboembolic disease because of the presence of one or more predisposing risk factors from Virchow's triad to prevent formation of an occlusive thrombus (primary prevention). For example, in an orthopedic surgery setting (e.g., hip and knee replacement), an antithrombotic agent is frequently administered prior to a surgical procedure. The antithrombotic agent counterbalances the prothrombotic stimulus exerted by vascular flow alterations (stasis), potential surgical vessel wall injury, as well as changes in the composition of the blood due to the acute phase response related to surgery. Another example of the use of an antithrombotic agent for primary prevention is dosing with aspirin, a platelet activation inhibitor, in patients at risk for developing thrombotic cardiovascular disease. Well recognized risk factors in this setting include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipid alterations, and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic agents are also indicated for secondary prevention, following an initial thrombotic episode. For example, patients with mutations in factor V (also known as factor V Leiden) and additional risk factors (\ne.g\n., pregnancy), are dosed with anticoagulants to prevent the reoccurrence of venous thrombosis. Another example entails secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. In a clinical setting, a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (or other thienopyridines) may be used to prevent a second thrombotic event.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic agents are also given to treat the disease state (\ni.e\n., by arresting its development) after it has already started. For example, patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis are treated with anticoagulants (\ni.e\n., heparin, warfarin, or LMWH) to prevent further growth of the venous occlusion. Over time, these agents also cause a regression of the disease state because the balance between prothrombotic factors and anticoagulant/profibrinolytic pathways is changed in favor of the latter. Examples on the arterial vascular bed include the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further growth of vascular occlusions and eventually leading to a regression of thrombotic occlusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, antithrombotic agents are used widely for primary and secondary prevention (\ni.e\n., prophylaxis or risk reduction) of thromboembolic disorders, as well as treatment of an already existing thrombotic process. Drugs that inhibit blood coagulation, or anticoagulants, are \"pivotal agents for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders\" (\nHirsh, J. et al., Blood 2005, 105:453-463\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative way of initiation of coagulation is operative when blood is exposed to artificial surfaces (\ne.g\n., during hemodialysis, 'on-pump' cardiovascular surgery, vessel grafts, bacterial sepsis), on cell surfaces, cellular receptors, cell debris, DNA, RNA, and extracellular matrices. This process is also termed contact activation. Surface absorption of factor XII leads to a conformational change in the factor XII molecule, thereby facilitating activation to proteolytic active factor XII molecules (factor XIIa and factor XIIf). Factor XIIa (or XIIf) has a number of target proteins, including plasma prekallikrein and factor XI. Active plasma kallikrein further activates factor XII, leading to an amplification of contact activation. Alternatively, the serine protease prolylcarboxylpeptidase can activate plasma kallikrein complexed with high molecular weight kininogen in a multiprotein complex formed on the surface of cells and matrices (\nShariat-Madar et al., Blood 2006, 108:192-199\n). Contact activation is a surface mediated process responsible in part for the regulation of thrombosis and inflammation, and is mediated, at least in part, by fibrinolytic-, complement-, kininogen/kinin-, and other humoral and cellular pathways (for review, \nColeman, R., Contact Activation Pathway, pp. 103-122 in Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001\n; \nSchmaier A.H., Contact Activation, pp. 105-128 in Thrombosis and Hemorrhage, 1998\n). The biological relevance of the contact activation system for thromboembolic diseases is supported by the phenotype of factor XII deficient mice. More specifically, factor XII deficient mice were protected from thrombotic vascular occlusion in several thrombosis models as well as stroke models and the phenotype of the XII deficient mice was identical to XI deficient mice (\nRenne et al., J. Exp. Medicine 2005, 202:271-281\n; \nKleinschmitz et al., J. Exp. Med. 2006, 203:513-518\n). The fact that factor XI is down-stream from factor XIIa, combined with the identical phenotype of the XII and XI deficient mice suggest that the contact activation system could play a major role in factor XI activation \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor XI is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is present in plasma at a relatively low concentration. Proteolytic activation at an internal R369-1370 bond yields a heavy chain (369 amino acids) and a light chain (238 amino acids). The latter contains a typical trypsin-like catalytic triad (H413, D464, and S557). Activation of factor XI by thrombin is believed to occur on negatively charged surfaces, most likely on the surface of activated platelets. Platelets contain high affinity (0.8 nM) specific sites (130-500/platelet) for activated factor XI. After activation, factor XIa remains surface bound and recognizes factor IX as its normal macromolecular substrate. (\nGaliani, D., Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000, 10:198-204\n.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the feedback activation mechanisms described above, thrombin activates thrombin activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), a plasma carboxypeptidase that cleaves C-terminal lysine and arginine residues on fibrin, reducing the ability of fibrin to enhance tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) dependent plasminogen activation. In the presence of antibodies to FXIa, clot lysis can occur more rapidly independent of plasma TAFI concentration. (\nBouma, B.N. et al., Thromb. Res. 2001, 101:329-354\n.) Thus, inhibitors of factor XIa are expected to be anticoagulant and profibrinolytic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther evidence for the anti-thromboembolic effects of targeting factor XI is derived from mice deficient in factor XI. It has been demonstrated that complete fXI deficiency protected mice from ferric chloride (FeCl\n3\n)-induced carotid artery thrombosis (\nRosen et al., Thromb. Haemost. 2002, 87:774-777\n; \nWang et al., J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005, 3:695-702\n). Also, factor XI deficiency rescues the perinatal lethal phenotype of complete protein C deficiency (\nChan et al., Amer. J. Pathology 2001, 158:469-479\n). Furthermore, baboon cross-reactive, function blocking antibodies to human factor XI protect against baboon arterial - venous shunt thrombosis (\nGruber et al., Blood 2003, 102:953-955\n). Evidence for an antithrombotic effect of small molecule inhibitors of factor XIa is also disclosed in published U.S. Patent Application No. \n \nUS 2004/0180855A1\n \n. Taken together, these studies suggest that targeting factor XI will reduce the propensity for thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic evidence indicates that factor XI is not required for normal homeostasis, implying a superior safety profile of the factor XI mechanism compared to competing antithrombotic mechanisms. In contrast to hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency), mutations of the factor XI gene causing factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) result in only a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis characterized primarily by postoperative or posttraumatic, but rarely spontaneous hemorrhage. Postoperative bleeding occurs mostly in tissue with high concentrations of endogenous fibrinolytic activity (\ne.g\n., oral cavity, and urogenital system). The majority of the cases are fortuitously identified by preoperative prolongation of aPTT (intrinsic system) without any prior bleeding history.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe increased safety of inhibition of XIa as an anticoagulation therapy is further supported by the fact that Factor XI knock-out mice, which have no detectable factor XI protein, undergo normal development, and have a normal life span. No evidence for spontaneous bleeding has been noted. The aPTT (intrinsic system) is prolonged in a gene dose-dependent fashion. Interestingly, even after severe stimulation of the coagulation system (tail transection), the bleeding time is not significantly prolonged compared to wild-type and heterozygous litter mates. (\nGailani, D., Frontiers in Bioscience 2001, 6:201-207\n; \nGailani, D. et al., Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 1997, 8:134-144\n.) Taken together, these observations suggest that high levels of inhibition of factor XIa should be well tolerated. This is in contrast to gene targeting experiments with other coagulation factors, excluding factor XII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn vivo\n activation of factor XI can be determined by complex formation with either C1 inhibitor or alpha 1 antitrypsin. In a study of 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), approximately 25% of the patients had values above the upper normal range of the complex ELISA. This study can be viewed as evidence that at least in a subpopulation of patients with AMI, factor XI activation contributes to thrombin formation (\nMinnema, M.C. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000, 20:2489-2493\n). A second study establishes a positive correlation between the extent of coronary arteriosclerosis and factor XIa in complex with alpha 1 antitrypsin (\nMurakami, T. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995, 15:1107-1113\n.). In another study, Factor XI levels above the 90th percentile in patients were associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis (\nMeijers, J.C.M. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 2000, 342:696-701\n.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma kallikrein is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is present in plasma at 35 to 50 µg/mL. The gene structure is similar to that of factor XI. Overall, the amino acid sequence of plasma kallikrein has 58% homology to factor XI. Proteolytic activation by factor XIIa at an internal I 389- R390 bond yields a heavy chain (371 amino acids) and a light chain (248 amino acids). The active site of plasma kallikrein is contained in the light chain. The light chain of plasma kallikrein reacts with protease inhibitors, including alpha 2 macroglobulin and C1- inhibitor. Interestingly, heparin significantly accelerates the inhibition of plasma kallikrein by antithrombin III in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). In blood, the majority of plasma kallikrein circulates in complex with HMWK. Plasma kallikrein cleaves HMWK to liberate bradykinin. Bradykinin release results in increase of vascular permeability and vasodilation (for review, \nColeman, R., Contact Activation Pathway, pp. 103-122 in Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001\n; \nSchmaier A.H., Contact Activation, pp. 105-128 in Thrombosis and Hemorrhage, 1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, it is preferred to find new compounds with improved activity in \nin vitro\n clotting assays, compared with known serine protease inhibitors, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or prothrombin time (PT) assay. (for a description of the aPTT and PT assays see, \nGoodnight, S.H., Hathaway, W.E., Screening Tests of Hemostasis in Disorders of Thrombosis and Hemostasis: A Clinical Guide, 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill: New York, 2001, pp. 41-51\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also desirable and preferable to find compounds with advantageous and improved characteristics compared with known serine protease inhibitors, in one or more of the following categories that are given as examples, and are not intended to be limiting: (a) pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability, half life, and clearance; (b) pharmaceutical properties; (c) dosage requirements; (d) factors that decrease blood concentration peak-to-trough characteristics; (e) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor; (f) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (g) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects, including selectivity versus other biological targets; and (h) factors that improve manufacturing costs or feasibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPre-clinical studies demonstrated significant antithrombotic effects of small molecule factor XIa inhibitors in rabbit and rat model of arterial thrombosis, at doses that preserved hemostasis. (\nWong P.C. et al., American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, November 12-15, 2006, Abstract No. 6118\n; \nSchumacher, W. et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2005, Vol. 3, Supplement 1 : P1228\n; \nSchumacher, W.A. et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, in press\n). Furthermore, it was observed that \nin vitro\n prolongation of the aPTT by specific XIa inhibitors is a good predictor of efficacy in our thrombosis models. Thus, the \nin vitro\n aPTT test can be used as a surrogate for efficacy \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"patient\" encompasses all mammalian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"treating\" or \"treatment\" cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; and/or (b) relieving the disease-state, \ni.e\n., causing regression of the disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"prophylaxis\" or 'prevention' cover the preventive treatment of a subclinical disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, aimed at reducing the probability of the occurrence of a clinical disease-state. Patients are selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. \"Prophylaxis\" therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurrence of the same or similar clinical disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"risk reduction\" covers therapies that lower the incidence of development of a clinical disease state. As such, primary and secondary prevention therapies are examples of risk reduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Therapeutically effective amount\" is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination to inhibit factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein and/or to prevent or treat the disorders listed herein.

The term \"embolism\", as used herein, refers to sudden blocking of an artery by a clot or foreign material that has been brought to its site of lodgment by the blood current. The term \"thromboembolism\", as used herein, refers to obstruction of a blood vessel with thrombotic material carried by the blood stream from the site of origin to plug another vessel.

In another embodiment, the term \"thromboembolic disorders\" includes acute coronary syndrome, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provide a compound of formula (I) for use in a method for the treatment of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I) for use in a method for the secondary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, atrial fibrillation and venous thrombosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"stroke\", as used herein, refers to embolic stroke or atherothrombotic stroke arising from occlusive thrombosis in the carotid communis, carotid interna, or intracerebral arteries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that thrombosis includes vessel occlusion (\ne.g\n., after a bypass) and reocclusion (\ne.g\n., during or after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). The thromboembolic disorders may result from conditions including but not limited to atherosclerosis, surgery or surgical complications, prolonged immobilization, arterial fibrillation, congenital thrombophilia, cancer, diabetes, effects of medications or hormones, and complications of pregnancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThromboembolic disorders are frequently associated with patients with atherosclerosis. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include but are not limited to male gender, age, hypertension, lipid disorders, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are at the same time risk factors for complications of atherosclerosis, i.e., thromboembolic disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, arterial fibrillation is frequently associated with thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for arterial fibrillation and subsequent thromboembolic disorders include cardiovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, nonrheumatic mitral valve disease, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and a variety of miscellaneous cardiac abnormalities as well as thyrotoxicosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus is frequently associated with atherosclerosis and thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for the more common type 2 include but are not limited to are family history, obesity, physical inactivity, race / ethnicity, previously impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance test, history of gestational diabetes mellitus or delivery of a 'big baby', hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRisk factor for congenital thrombophilia include gain of function mutations in coagulation factors or loss of function mutations in the anticoagulant- or fibrinolytic pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombosis has been associated with a variety of tumor types, e.g., pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, brain tumors, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, and Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Recent studies suggest that the frequency of cancer in patients with thrombosis reflects the frequency of a particular cancer type in the general population (\nLevitan, N. et al., Medicine (Baltimore) 1999, 78(5):285-291\n; \nLevine M. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 1996, 334(11):677-681\n; \nBlom, J.W. et al., JAMA 2005, 293(6):715-722\n). Hence, the most common cancers associated with thrombosis in men are prostate, colorectal, brain, and lung cancer, and in women are breast, ovary, and lung cancer. The observed rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients is significant. The varying rates of VTE between different tumor types are most likely related to the selection of the patient population. Cancer patients at risk for thrombosis may possess any or all of the following risk factors: (i) the stage of the cancer (i.e., presence of metastases), (ii) the presence of central vein catheters, (iii) surgery and anticancer therapies including chemotherapy, and (iv) hormones and antiangiogenic drugs. Thus, it is common clinical practice to dose patients having advanced tumors with heparin or low molecular heparin to prevent thromboembolic disorders. A number of low molecular heparin preparations have been approved by the FDA for these indications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are three main clinical situations when considering the prevention of VTE in a medical cancer patient: (i) the patient is bedridden for prolonged periods of time; (ii) the ambulatory patient is receiving chemotherapy or radiation; and (iii) the patient is with indwelling central vein catheters. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are effective antithrombotic agents in cancer patients undergoing surgery. (\nMismetti, P. et al., British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88:913-930\n.)\n\n\n \nA. \nIn Vitro\n Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of the coagulation factors XIa, VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIIa, plasma kallikrein or thrombin, can be determined using a relevant purified serine protease, respectively, and an appropriate synthetic substrate. The rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate by the relevant serine protease was measured both in the absence and presence of compounds of the present invention. Hydrolysis of the substrate resulted in the release of pNA (para nitroaniline), which was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm, or the release of AMC (amino methylcoumarin), which was monitored spectrofluorometrically by measuring the increase in emission at 460 nm with excitation at 380 nm. A decrease in the rate of absorbance or fluorescence change in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of enzyme inhibition. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art. The results of this assay are expressed as the inhibitory constant, K\ni\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor XIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000 (polyethylene glycol; JT Baker or Fisher Scientific).

Refludan was added to inhibit small amounts of thrombin in the commercial preparations of human Factor IXa. Determinations were made using purified human Factor IXa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 20-100 nM and the synthetic substrate PCIXA2100-B (CenterChem) or Pefafluor IXa 3688 (H-D-Leu-Ph'Gly-Arg-AMC; CenterChem) at a concentration of 0.0004-0.0005 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor Xa determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human Factor Xa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 150-1000 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2222 (Bz-Ile-Glu (gamma-OMe, 50%)-Gly-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00035 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor XIIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human Factor XIIa at a final concentration of 4 nM (American Diagnostica) and the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme #312 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; American Diagnostica) at a concentration of 0.00015 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma kallikrein determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.1-0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human kallikrein (Enzyme Research Laboratories) at a final assay concentration of 200 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2302 (H-(D)-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.00008-0.0004 M. The Km value used for calculation of Ki was 0.00005 to 0.00007 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombin determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human alpha thrombin (Haematologic Technologies or Enzyme Research Laboratories) at a final assay concentration of 200-250 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00026 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Michaelis constant, K\nm\n, for substrate hydrolysis by each protease, was determined at 25 °C using the method of Lineweaver and Burk. Values of K\ni\n were determined by allowing the protease to react with the substrate in the presence of the inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to go for periods of 20-180 minutes (depending on the protease) and the velocities (rate of absorbance or fluorescence change versus time) were measured. The following relationships were used to calculate K\ni\n values: \n \n \n \n \nv\n \nO\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nv\n \nS\n \n \n \n \n \n/\n \n \nv\n \nS\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \nI\n \n/\n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n1\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \nS\n \n/\n \n \nK\n \nm\n \n \n \n \n \n \n for a competitive inhibitor with one binding site;\n \n \n \nv\n \ns\n \n \n/\n \n \nv\n \no\n \n \n=\n \nA\n \n+\n \n \n \nB\n \n-\n \nA\n \n \n/\n \n1\n \n+\n \n \n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n \nI\n \n \nn\n \n \n \n \n \n;\n \n \n \n and \n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n \n=\n \nI\n \n⁢\n \n \nC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \nS\n \n/\n \n \nK\n \nm\n \n \n \n \n \nfor a competitive inhibitor\n \n \n \n for a competitive inhibitor\n\nwhere:\n\n \n \n \nv\no\n is the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor;\n \nv\ns\n is the velocity in the presence of inhibitor;\n \nI is the concentration of inhibitor;\n \nA is the minimum activity remaining (usually locked at zero);\n \nB is the maximum activity remaining (usually locked at 1.0);\n \nn is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the number and cooperativity of potential inhibitor binding sites;\n \nIC\n50\n is the concentration of inhibitor that produces 50% inhibition under the assay conditions;\n \nK\ni\n is the dissociation constant of the enzyme:inhibitor complex;\n \nS is the concentration of substrate; and\n \nK\nm\n is the Michaelis constant for the substrate.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe selectivity of a compound may be evaluated by taking the ratio of the K\ni\n value for a given protease with the K\ni\n value for the protease of interest (\ni.e\n., selectivity for FXIa versus protease P = K\ni\n for protease P/K\ni\n for FXIa). Compounds with selectivity ratios >20 are considered selective. Compounds with selectivity ratios>100 are preferred, and compounds with selectivity ratios > 500 are more preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of coagulation can be determined using a standard or modified clotting assay. An increase in the plasma clotting time in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of anticoagulation. Relative clotting time is the clotting time in the presence of an inhibitor divided by the clotting time in the absence of an inhibitor. The results of this assay may be expressed as IC1.5x or IC2x, the inhibitor concentration required to increase the clotting time by 50 or 100 percent, respectively. The IC1.5x or IC2x is found by linear interpolation from relative clotting time versus inhibitor concentration plots using inhibitor concentration that spans the IC1.5x or IC2x.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClotting times are determined using citrated normal human plasma as well as plasma obtained from a number of laboratory animal species (\ne.g\n., rat, or rabbit). A compound is diluted into plasma beginning with a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 2%. Plasma clotting assays are performed in an automated coagulation analyzer (Sysmex, Dade-Behring, Illinois). Similarly, clotting times can be determined from laboratory animal species or humans dosed with compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is determined using Alexin (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37°C for 1 minute. Alexin (0.05 mL) is added to the plasma and incubated for an additional 2 to 5 minutes. Calcium chloride (25 mM, 0.05 mL) is added to the reaction to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment calcium chloride is added until a clot is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProthrombin Time (PT) is determined using thromboplastin (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade-Behring, Illinois) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37°C for 1 minute. Thromboplastin (0.1 mL) is added to the plasma to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment thromboplastin is added until a clot is detected.\n\n\n \nB. \nIn Vivo\n Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as antithrombotic agents can be determined using relevant \nin vivo\n thrombosis models, including \nIn Vivo\n Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis Models and \nIn Vivo\n Rabbit Arterio-venous Shunt Thrombosis Models.\n\n\n \na. \nIn Vivo\n Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (ECAT) Model\n\n\n \n \n \nThe rabbit ECAT model, described by \nWong et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000, 295:212-218\n), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg + 50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. An electromagnetic flow probe is placed on a segment of an isolated carotid artery to monitor blood flow. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to or after the initiation of thrombosis. Drug treatment prior to initiation of thrombosis is used to model the ability of test agents to prevent and reduce the risk of thrombus formation, whereas dosing after initiation is used to model the ability to treat existing thrombotic disease. Thrombus formation is induced by electrical stimulation of the carotid artery for 3 min at 4 mA using an external stainless-steel bipolar electrode. Carotid blood flow is measured continuously over a 90-min period to monitor thrombus-induced occlusion. Total carotid blood flow over 90 min is calculated by the trapezoidal rule. Average carotid flow over 90 min is then determined by converting total carotid blood flow over 90 min to percent of total control carotid blood flow, which would result if control blood flow had been maintained continuously for 90 min. The ED\n50\n (dose that increased average carotid blood flow over 90 min to 50% of the control) of compounds are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E\nmax\n equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\n\n\n \nb. \nIn Vivo\n Rabbit Arterio-venous (AV) Shunt Thrombosis Model\n\n\n \n \n \nThe rabbit AV shunt model, described by Wong et al. (\nWong, P.C. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000, 292:351-357\n), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg + 50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. The femoral artery, jugular vein and femoral vein are isolated and catheterized. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of an outer piece of tygon tubing (length = 8 cm; internal diameter = 7.9 mm) and an inner piece of tubing (length = 2.5 cm; internal diameter = 4.8 mm). The AV shunt also contains an 8-cm-long 2-0 silk thread (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Blood flows from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread induces the formation of a significant thrombus. Forty minutes later, the shunt is disconnected and the silk thread covered with thrombus is weighed. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to the opening of the AV shunt. The percentage inhibition of thrombus formation is determined for each treatment group. The ID\n50\n values (dose that produces 50% inhibition of thrombus formation) are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E\nmax\n equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds can be demonstrated in an Evans Blue dye extravasation assay using C1-esterase inhibitor deficient mice. In this model, mice are dosed with a compound of the present invention, Evans Blue dye is injected via the tail vein, and extravasation of the blue dye is determined by spectrophotometric means from tissue extracts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of the current invention to reduce or prevent the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, for example, as observed during on-pump cardiovascular procedures, can be tested in \nin vitro\n perfusion systems, or by on-pump surgical procedures in larger mammals, including dogs and baboons. Read-outs to assess the benefit of the compounds of the present invention include for example reduced platelet loss, reduced platelet / white blood cell complexes, reduced neutrophil elastase levels in plasma, reduced activation of complement factors, and reduced activation and/or consumption of contact activation proteins (plasma kallikrein, factor XII, factor XI, high molecular weight kininogen, C1-esterase inhibitors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be useful as inhibitors of additional serine proteases, notably human thrombin, human plasma kallikrein and human plasmin. Because of their inhibitory action, these compounds are indicated for use in the prevention or treatment of physiological reactions, including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, blood pressure regulation and inflammation, and wound healing catalyzed by the aforesaid class of enzymes. Specifically, the compounds have utility as drugs for the treatment of diseases arising from elevated thrombin activity of the aforementioned serine proteases, such as myocardial infarction, and as reagents used as anticoagulants in the processing of blood to plasma for diagnostic and other commercial purposes.\n\n\n \nV. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS, FORMULATIONS AND COMBINATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutical composition\" means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, \ni.e\n., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and nonaqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, \ne.g\n., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, 1990\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. A physician or veterinarian can determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the thromboembolic disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight, preferably between about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg/day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention can also be administered by parenteral administration (\ne.g\n., intra-venous, intra-arterial, intra-musculary, or sub-cutaneously. When administered intra-venous or intra-arterial, the dose can be given continuously or intermittent. Furthermore, formulation can be developed for intramusculary and subcutaneous delivery that ensure a gradual release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using transdermal skin patches. When administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, \ne.g\n., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 1000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGelatin capsules may contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl-or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,\n Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds of this invention are combined with other anticoagulant agents, for example, a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams per kilogram of patient body weight. For a tablet dosage form, the compounds of this invention generally may be present in an amount of about 5 to about 100 milligrams per dosage unit, and the second anti-coagulant in an amount of about 1 to about 50 milligrams per dosage unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with an anti-platelet agent, by way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.01 to about 25 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 50 to about 150 milligrams of the anti-platelet agent, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 1 to about 3 milligrams of antiplatelet agents, per kilogram of patient body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with thrombolytic agent, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention, per kilogram of patient body weight and, in the case of the thrombolytic agents, the usual dosage of the thrombolyic agent when administered alone may be reduced by about 50-80% when administered with a compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from potassium channel openers, potassium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium hydrogen exchanger inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents, antiatherosclerotic agents, anticoagulants, antithrombotic agents, prothrombolytic agents, fibrinogen antagonists, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, ATPase inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, phospodiesterase inhibitors, antidiabetic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, angiogenesis modulators, antiosteoporosis agents, hormone replacement therapies, hormone receptor modulators, oral contraceptives, antiobesity agents, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, antipsychotic agents, antiproliferative agents, antitumor agents, antiulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease agents, growth hormone agents and/or growth hormone secretagogues, thyroid mimetics, anti-infective agents, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, cholesterol/lipid lowering agents and lipid profile therapies, and agents that mimic ischemic preconditioning and/or myocardial stunning, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from an antiarrhythmic agent, an anti-hypertensive agent, an anti-coagulant agent, an anti-platelet agent, a thrombin inhibiting agent, a thrombolytic agent, a fibrinolytic agent, a calcium channel blocker, a potassium channel blocker, a cholesterol/lipid lowering agent, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from warfarin, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, synthetic pentasaccharide, hirudin, argatroban, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, mefenamate, dipyridamol, droxicam, diclofenac, sulfinpyrazone, piroxicam, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, tirofiban, eptifibatide, abciximab, melagatran, ximelagatran, disulfatohirudin, tissue plasminogen activator, modified tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase, and streptokinase, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition wherein the additional therapeutic agent is an antihypertensive agent selected from ACE inhibitors, AT-1 receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, ETA receptor antagonists, dual ETA/AT-1 receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors (alliskerin) and vasopepsidase inhibitors, an antiarrythmic agent selected from IKur inhibitors, an anticoagulant selected from thrombin inhibitors, antithrombin-III activators, heparin co-factor II activators, other factor XIa inhibitors, other kallikrein inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) antagonists, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibitors, factor VIIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors, or an antiplatelet agent selected from GPIIb/IIIa blockers, GP Ib/IX blockers, protease activated receptor I (PAR-1) antagonists, protease activated receptor4 (PAR-4) antagonists, prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3 antagonists, collagen receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors, P2Y\n1\n receptor antagonists, P2Y\n12\n antagonists, thromboxane receptor antagonists, cyclooxygense-1 inhibitors, and aspirin, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent(s) are an anti-platelet agent or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent is the anti-platelet agent clopidogrel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. By \"administered in combination\" or \"combination therapy\" it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that can be administered in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, anticoagulants, anti-thrombin agents, anti-platelet agents, fibrinolytics, hypolipidemic agents, antihypertensive agents, and anti-ischemic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther anticoagulant agents (or coagulation inhibitory agents) that may be used in combination with the compounds of this invention include warfarin, heparin (either unfractionated heparin or any commercially available low molecular weight heparin, for example LOVENOX\n®\n), synthetic pentasaccharide, direct acting thrombin inhibitors including hirudin and argatroban, as well as other factor VIIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., ARIXTRA\n®\n, apixaban, rivaroxaban, LY-517717, DU-176b, DX-9065a, and those disclosed in \n \nWO 98/57951\n \n, \n \nWO 03/026652\n \n, \n \nWO 01/047919\n \n, and \n \nWO 00/076970\n \n), factor XIa inhibitors, and inhibitors of activated TAFI and PAI-1 known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term anti-platelet agents (or platelet inhibitory agents), as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit platelet function, for example, by inhibiting the aggregation, adhesion or granule-content secretion of platelets.

Preferably, the anti-platelet agent is clopidogrel or prasugrel, more preferably clopidogrel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term thrombin inhibitors (or anti-thrombin agents), as used herein, denotes inhibitors of the serine protease thrombin. By inhibiting thrombin, various thrombin-mediated processes, such as thrombin-mediated platelet activation (that is, for example, the aggregation of platelets, and/or the secretion of platelet granule contents including serotonin) and/or fibrin formation are disrupted.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to aza-substituted spiro derivatives.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has been known that, in organisms such as typically mammals, histamine which is a physiologically-active endogenous factor functions as a neurotransmitter and has extensive pharmacological activities (for example, see \nLife Science, Vol. 17, p. 503 (1975\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical studies have made it clear that a histamine-agonistic (producing) cell body exists in the nodal papillary nucleus in a posterior hypothalamic region and that histamine nerve fibers project in an extremely broad range in the brain, which supports various pharmacological effects of histamine (for example, see \nJournal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 273, p. 283\n). The existence of histamine-agonistic nerves in the nodal papillary nucleus in a posterior hypothalamic region suggests that histamine may have an important role in control of physiological functions relating to brain functions, especially to hypothalamic functions (sleep, vigilance rhythm, incretion, eating and drinking action, sexual action, etc.) (for example, see \nProgress in Neurobiology, Vol. 63, p. 637 (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe existence of projection to the brain region that relates to vigilance sustenance, for example, to cerebral cortex suggests the role in control of vigilance or vigilance-sleep cycle. The existence of projection to many peripheral structures such as hippocampus and amygdaloid complex suggests the role in control of autonomic nerves, emotion, control of motivated action and learning/memory process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen released from producing cells, histamine acts with a specific polymer that is referred to as a receptor on the surface of a cell membrane or inside a target cell, therefore exhibiting its pharmacological effects for control of various body functions. Heretofore, four types of histamine receptors have been found. In particular, the presence of a histamine receptor that participates in the central and peripheral nervous functions, histamine-H3 receptor, has been shown by various pharmacological and physiological studies (for example, see \nTrends in Pharmacological Science, Vol. 8, p. 24 (1987\n)); and recently, human and rodent histamine-H3 receptor genes have been identified and their existence has been made clear (for example, see \nMolecular Pharmacology, Vol. 55, p. 1101 (1999\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is suggested that histamine-H3 receptor exists in the presynaptic membrane of central or peripheral neurocytes and functions as a self-receptor, therefore controlling the release of histamine and controlling the release of other neurotransmitters. Specifically, it is reported that a histamine-H3 receptor agonist, or its antagonist or inverse-agonist controls the release of histamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, acetylcholine or dopamine from nerve ending. For example, the release of these neurotransmitters is inhibited by an agonist such as (R)-(α)-methylhistamine, and is promoted by an antagonist or inverse-agonist such as thioperamide (for example, see \nTrends in Pharmacological Science, Vol. 19, p. 177 (1998\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO99/22735\n \n discloses compounds similar to but not identical to the compounds of this invention. Furthermore the usage described in the reference is different from that of the present invention, because the invention of the reference is related to Somatostatin agonists.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAn object of the invention is to provide a novel substance having a histamine-H3 receptor antagonistic effect (an effect of inhibiting histamine from binding to a histamine-H3 receptor) or a histamine-H3 receptor inverse-agonistic effect (an effect of inhibiting the homeostatic activity that a histamine-H3 receptor has), or that is, a novel substance that acts as a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist in living bodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe, the present inventors provide compounds or salts for attaining the above object, specifically a compound selected from the following list or its pharmaceutically-acceptable salt:\n\n \n \n \nTrans-5'-methoxy-3'-oxo-N-methyl-N-(2-piperidin-1ylethyl)-spiro[cyclohexane-11'-(3'H)-4'-azaisobenzofuran]-4-carboxamide,\n \nTrans-5'-methoxy-3'-oxo-N-methyl-N-(2-pyrrolidin-1ylethyl)-spiro[cyclohexane-1,1'-(3'H)-4'-azaisobenzofuran]-4-carboxamide,\n \nTrans-4'-methoxy-3'-oxo-N-methyl-N-(2-piperidin-1-ylethyl)-spiro[cyclohexane-1,1'-(3'H)-5'-azaisobenzofuran]-4-carboxamide,\n \nTrans-4'-methyl-3'-oxo-N-methyl-N-(2-piperidin-1-ylethyl)-spiro[cyclohexane-1,1'-(3'H)-5'-azaisobenzofuran]-4-carboxamide,\n \nTrans-4'-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3'-oxo-N-methyl-N-(2-piperidin-1-ylethyl)- spiro[cyclohexane-1,1'-(3'H)-5'-azaisobenzofuran]-4-carboxamide, and\n \nTrans-5'-pyrazinyl-3'-oxo-N-methyl-N-(2-piperidin-1-ylethyl)-spiro[cyclohexane-1,1'-(3'H)-4'-azaisobenzofuran]-4-carboxamide;\n \n\nhereinafter termed a compound of formula (I).\n    \n \n \n \nSaid compound or its salt acts as a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist in living bodies. Accordingly, the invention provides a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist comprising the compound or its pharmaceutically-acceptable salt as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies have shown that a histamine-H3 receptor has extremely high homeostatic activities (activities observed in the absence of an endogenous agonistic factor (e.g., histamine)) in the receptor-expressing cells/tissues or in a membrane fraction derived from the expressing cells/tissues and even in living bodies (for example, see \nNature, Vol. 408, p. 860\n). It is reported that these homeostatic activities are inhibited by an inverse-agonist. For example, thioperamide or syproxyfan inhibits the homeostatic self-receptor activity of a histamine-H3 receptor, and, as a result, promotes the release of neurotransmitters (e.g., histamine) from nerve ending.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding rats, a high-level selective inhibitor of histamine synthetase (histidine decarboxylase) inhibits the vigilance of rats, and therefore histamine participates in controlling motive vigilance. Regarding cats, administration of (R)-(α)-methylhistamine to cats increases their deep slow-wave sleep (for example, see \nBrain Research, Vol. 523, p. 325 (1990\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContrary to this, thioperamide dose-dependently increases vigilance, and decreases slow-wave and REM sleep (for example, see \nLife Science, Vol. 48, p. 2397 (1991\n)). A histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist, thioperamide or GT-2331 reduces emotional cataplexy and sleep of narcoleptic dogs (for example, see \nBrain Research, Vol. 793, p. 279 (1998\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese information suggest that the H3 receptor may participate in control of vigilance-sleep and in sleep disorder-associated diseases, further suggesting a possibility that a selective histamine-H3 agonist, antagonist or inverse-agonist may be useful for treatment of sleep disorders or various sleep disorder-associated diseases (for example, idiopathic hypersomnnia, repetitive hypersomnnia, true hypersomnnia, narcolepsy, sleep periodic acromotion disorder, sleep apnea syndrome, circadian rhythm disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, REM sleep disorder, senile insomnia, night workers' sleep insanitation, idiopathic insomnia, repetitive insomnia, true insomnia, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Accordingly, it may be considered that the compounds or their salts of above (1) acting as a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist may be effective for prevention and remedy of sleep disorders and various sleep disorder-associated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn rats, thioperamide or GT-2331 relieves the condition of learning disorder (LD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD) (for example, see \nLife Science, Vol. 69, p. 469 (2001\n)). Further in rats, (R)-(α)-methylhistamine lowers their object cognitive and learning effects in the object cognition test and the passive turnout test with them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, in a scopolamine-induced amnesia test, thioperamide dose-dependently relieves amnesia induced by the chemical (for example, see \nPharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, Vol. 68, p. 735 (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese information suggest a possibility that a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist may be useful for prevention or remedy of memory/learning disorder and various diseases accompanied by it (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Accordingly, it may also be considered that the present compound or its salt may be effective for prevention or remedy of such memory/learning disorder and various diseases accompanied by it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding rats, administration of histamine to their ventricle inhibits their eating action, therefore suggesting that histamine may participate in control of eating action (for example, see\n Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, Vol. 49, p. 191 (1998\n)). In fact, thioperamide dose-dependently inhibits eating action and promotes intracerebral histamine release (for example, see \nBehavioral Brain Research, Vol. 104, p. 147 (1999\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese information suggest that a histamine H3 receptor may participate in eating action control, further suggesting that a histamine-H3 antagonist or inverse-agonist may be useful for prevention or remedy of metabolic system diseases (metabolic syndromes) such as eating disorder, obesity, diabetes, emaciation, hyperlipemia. Accordingly, it may be considered that the present compound or it salt may be effective also for prevention or remedy of such metabolic system diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn rats, (R)-(α)-methylhistamine dose-dependently lowers their basal diastolic pressure, and its action is antagonized by thioperamide (for example, see \nEuropean Journal of Pharmacology, Vol. 234, p. 129, (1993\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese information suggest that a histamine-H3 receptor may participate in control of blood pressure, heart beat and cardiac output, further suggesting that a histamine-H3 receptor agonist, antagonist or inverse-agonist may be useful for prevention or remedy of circulatory system diseases such as hypertension and various cardiac disorders. Accordingly, it may be considered that the present compound or it salt may be effective also for prevention or remedy of such circulatory system diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn mice, thioperamide dose-dependently inhibits the spasm induced by electric shock or the epileptoid seizure induced by pentylene tetrazole (PTZ) (for example, see \nEuropean Journal of Pharmacology, Vol. 234, p. 129 (1993\n) and \nPharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, Vol. 68, p. 735 (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese information suggest that a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist may be useful for prevention or remedy of epilepsy or central spasm. Accordingly, it may be considered that the present compound or it salt may be effective also for prevention or remedy of such epilepsy or central spasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the invention further provides a preventive or remedy for metabolic system diseases, circulatory system diseases or nervous system diseases, which contains, as the active ingredient thereof, the present compound or its pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe metabolic system diseases are at least one selected from obesity, diabetes, hormone secretion disorder, hyperlipemia, gout and fatty liver.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe circulatory system diseases are at least one selected from stenocardia, acute/congestive cardiac insufficiency, cardiac infarction, coronary arteriosclerosis, hypertension, nephropathy and electrolyte disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nervous system diseases are at least one selected from sleep disorder, diseases accompanied by sleep disorder, bulimia, emotional disorder, epilepsy, delirium, dementia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, memory disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cognition disorder, motion disorder, paresthesia, dysosmia, morphine resistance, drug dependency, alcoholism and tremor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nervous system diseases are at least one selected from idiopathic hypersomnnia, repetitive hypersomnnia, true hypersomnnia, narcolepsy, sleep periodic acromotion disorder, sleep apnea syndrome, circadian rhythm disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, REM sleep disorder, senile insomnia, night workers' sleep insanitation, idiopathic insomnia, repetitive insomnia, true insomnia, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compound or its pharmaceutically-acceptable salt may be used, as combined with a co-drug. Accordingly, the invention further provides a preventive or remedy for metabolic system diseases, circulator system diseases or nervous system diseases, which contains a present compound or its pharmaceutically-acceptable salt and a co-drug, as the active ingredients thereof. The co-drug includes a remedy for diabetes, a remedy for hyperlipemia, a remedy for hypertension, an anti-obesity drug. Two or more such co-drugs may be used herein, as combined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preventive or remedy for such diseases, which the invention provides herein, may comprise the following (i), (ii) and (iii):\n\n \n \n \n(i) a compound or its pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of any one of above (1);\n \n(ii) at least one selected from a group of the following (a) to (g):\n\n \n(a) a histamine-H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist except (i);\n \n(b) a biguanide,\n \n(c) a PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor)-agonist;\n \n(d) insulin,\n \n(e) somatostatin,\n \n(f) an α-glucosidase inhibitor,\n \n(g) an insulin secretion promoter;\n \n \n \n(iii) a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention (and similar compounds) can be produced, for example, according to the following method:\n\n \n \n\nwherein Hal represents a halogen atom; L\n1\n represents a methanesulfonyl group, a trifluoromethanesulfonyl group or a p-toluenesulfonyl group.

The resulting expression vector was transfected into host cells, HEK293 and CHO-K1 (American Type Culture Collection), according to a cationic lipid process [see \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol., 84, p. 7413 (1987\n)] to obtain histamine-H3 receptor expression cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA membrane specimen prepared from the cells having expressed a histamine-H3 receptor was incubated in an assay buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4) along with a test compound and 20,000 cpm [3H]N-α-methylhistamine (by NEN) therein, at 25°C for 2 hours, and then filtered through a glass filter GF/C. After washed with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), the radioactivity on the glass filter was determined. The non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 µM thioperamide (by SIGAM), and the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) of the test compound to the specific N-alpha-methylhistamine binding was calculated [see \nMolecular Pharmacology, Vol. 55, p. 1101 (1999\n)].
