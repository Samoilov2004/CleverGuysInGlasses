Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to new compounds of formula (I) possessing agonistic activity at sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, their process of preparation and their use as immunosuppressive agents. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and use of these compounds for treatment/prevention of immune mediated diseases and conditions or inflammatory diseases and conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA class of 3-aryl or 5-aryl-1,2,4-oxadiazole based dicarboxylic acid derivatives has been found as potent spingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1/Edg1) receptor agonists with minimal affinity for S1P3 (Edg3) receptor subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lysophospholipids are recognized as components in the biosynthesis of cell membranes. The lysophospholipid S1P regulates diverse biological processes. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lysolipid with pleiotropic functions mediated through a family of G protein coupled receptors, S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5. It regulates heart rate, coronary artery blood flow, endothelial integrity in lung and recirculation of lymphocytes (H. Rosen et al., \nThe J. Bio. Chem., \n2004, 279, 13839-13848). Among other effects, indirect or direct S1P receptor agonists inhibit thymic egress and lymphocyte recirculation (Rosen et al, \nImmunol. Rev., \n2003, 195, 160). Inhibition of lymphocyte egress is associated with clinically useful immunosuppression or immuno-depression in both transplantation and autoimmune diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonism of S1P receptors induces accelerated homing of lymphocytes to lymph nodes and Peyer's patches and blood lymphopenia without lymphodepletion. Such immunosuppression/depression is desirable to prevent rejection after organ, tissue or cell transplantation and in the treatment of autoimmune and certain inflammatory disorders. The potential clinical indications identified through several animal models involving S1P agonists include suppressed transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis, coronary artery vasospasm, sinus tachycardia, restenosis after coronary artery angioplasty, asthma, breast and liver cancer, chemotherapy and radiation induced infertility etc. (J, Chun et al, Trends Mol. Med., 2006, 12(2), 65-75).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFTY720, a synthetic analogue of the natural product myriocin, useful for the treatment of transplant rejection and human autoimmune diseases is currently in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis (J., Chun et al, \nTrends Mol. Med., \n2006, 12(2), 65-75). However, FTY720 is reported to have an adverse event of asymptomatic bradycardia (\nJ. Am. Soc. Nephrol., \n2002, 13, 1073) associated with non selective agonism at the S1P3 receptor (\nBioorg\n. & \nMed. Chem. Lett., \n2004, 14, 3501).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is potential interest in developing direct S1P receptor agonists displaying receptor selectivity, particularly compounds with low relative activity at the S1P3 receptor subtype expressed in cardiac tissues and whose activation results in bradycardia and cardiac depression (S. Mandala et al., \nJPET, \n2004, 309, 758-768; H. Rosen et al., \nThe J. Bio. Chem., \n2004, 279, 13839-13848).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object of the present invention is to provide novel compounds that are potent S1P1 receptor agonist with low affinity to S1P3/Edg3 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEP 1 650 186, WO 2005/082 089, WO 2004/058 149, WO 2003/105 771 and Hale et al., J.

Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral centers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts.

Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons, 1991; J. F. W. McOmie in \nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n, Plenum Press, 1973.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome reactions may be carried out in the presence of a base. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the base to be used in this reaction, and any base conventionally used in reactions of this type may equally be used here, provided that it has no adverse effect on other parts of the molecule. Examples of suitable bases include: sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; alkyllithium compounds, such as methyllithium and butyllithium; and alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent. A variety of solvents may be used, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved.

However, provided that the reaction is effected under the preferred conditions outlined above, a period of from 3 hours to 20 hours will usually suffice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound thus prepared may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, the compounds may be recovered by distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture or, if necessary after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, pouring the residue into water followed by extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent and distilling off the solvent from the extract.

Although the native cells somewhat respond to S1P, the level of expression and responsiveness of the antibiotic-resistant transfected cell lines that were selected is much higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cultivated cells reached 80% confluence, they were collected and, after lysis, cell membranes were collected by centrifugation and washed in buffer containing antiproteases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand binding assays were performed using 5-20 μg of cell membranes suspended in 20 mM tris-HCl pH 7.4 containing 15 mM NaF and 2.5 mM deoxypyridoxine in a final volume of 250 μl. The radioligand was 0.5 nM \n3\nH-D-erythro-dihydro-S1P incubated in the presence of bovine serum albumin for 1 h after or 2 h-preincubation. Non specific binding was defined from incubations in the presence of 5 μM S1P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGTP-γ-\n35\nS binding was performed using ˜5 μg protein of cell membranes suspended in 50 mM tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 100 mM NaCl and 10 μM GDP. The radioligand was 0.025 nM [\n35\nS] GTP-γ-S and non specific binding determined in the presence of 10 μM non-radioactive GTP-γ-S. S1P and receptor agonists enhance the specific binding whereas inverse agonists reduce it. The maximal stimulation elicited by S1P was taken as a reference to define full or partial agonism and calculate the intrinsic activity (i.a.) of compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical results shown in Table 1 indicate that compounds of the invention are able to activate S1P1 receptors with a potency similar to that of S1P itself (i.e. with full intrinsic activity and at nanomolar concentrations) without affecting significantly S1P3 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgonist activity of selected compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIn-Vitro potency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx\n\n\n \n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN°\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nEdg1\n\n\nEdg3\n\n\nEdg5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLymphopenia was assessed in vivo.
