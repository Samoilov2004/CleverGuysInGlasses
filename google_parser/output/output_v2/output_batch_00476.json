Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application claims benefit of provisional application No. 61/074,417 filed Jun. 20, 2008.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to methods of treating bipolar disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and to compounds suitable for use in such treatments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the such compounds, processes for preparing the such compounds and prodrugs thereof.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nA number of drugs have been approved to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (e.g., anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics), and treatment of mania has been achieved with several atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine). Other compounds have been used for the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder (e.g., reboxetine and desimpramine) as well as bipolar depression (quetiapine). However, improvement in therapy is still desired in terms of achieving better remission rates, more effective treatment of depression and an improved side-effect profile (e.g., reduced sedation and reduced weight gain).\n\n\nFor nearly 50 years, since the early 1960s, scientific and clinical investigators have sought to understand the pharmacology of tricyclic neuroleptic compounds. Numerous US and Foreign patents and scientific publications have described hundreds of different tricyclic compounds with varying antipsychotic and anti-depressive properties. In the 1960s, CH422793 a Swiss patent filed in 1961, and NL293210 a Dutch patent application filed in 1963, described tricyclic compounds. Almost forty years later, a scientific paper published in 2001 (Behavioral Approach to Nondyskinetic Antagonists: Identification of Seroquel, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 372-380) described other different tricyclic compounds. Still more recently in early 2009, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,491,715 B1 and 7,517,871 B1 were granted describing new analogues of clozapine.\n\n\nDespite having a wide spectrum of pharmacological activity, current bipolar and schizophrenia drugs exhibit variable efficacy and side-effect profiles. Although some current drugs have acute efficacy, remission rates are still low. Safety and tolerability are still issues since approximately 75% of patients experience side effects, and treatment compliance is a major issue. Additionally, the mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotics is not well understood, for example, the label of Seroquel states:\n\n \n \n \n \n“the mechanism of action of Seroquel, as with other drugs having efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of Seroquel. Seroquel's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Seroquel's antagonism of adrenergic α1 receptors may explain in the orthostatic hypotension observed with, this drug.”\n \n \n \n\n\nSimilarly, the label for olanzapine states:\n\n \n \n \n \n“The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder is unknown.\n \nAntagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapine's antagonism of muscarinic M1-5 receptors may explain its anticholinergic effects. Olanzapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapine's antagonism of adrenergic α1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.”\n \n \n \n\n\nThus, notwithstanding that numerous tricyclic compounds having antipsychotic and anti-depressant activity have been described and used in therapy, improved ways to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disease are still sought. Particularly, effective treatment of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder is desired and still sought, as is treatment of the manic phase, mood stabilization and maintenance for sufferers of bipolar disorder.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nWe contemplate a new target product efficacy profile that is consistent with the putative mechanisms of action of quetiapine in bipolar disorder (i.e. potent NET inhibition and moderate D2 antagonism). Clinical studies with quetiapine suggest that NET and D2 occupancy in the range of 30 to 60% may be sufficient to drive a therapeutic effect in bipolar disorder. Further, improved safety may be achieved by having less interaction with other targets (e.g., H1, M1) at clinical doses achieving 50% NET occupancy.\n\n\nA therapeutic agent with such a profile is expected to provide advantages for the treatment of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder, to have potential for mood stabilization and maintenance of sufferers of bipolar disorder with potential for use in the amelioration of mania associated with bipolar conditions.\n\n\nThus, in one aspect, it is desirable to obtain at least one of the following attributes: moderate D2 antagonism; potent NET inhibition; or an H1 in vitro binding K\ni \nvalue that is close to the value of the K\ni \nfor NET. In a particular aspect it is desirable to obtain at least one of the following in vitro attributes: D2 GTPγS IC\n50 \nless than about 600 nM; D2 binding K\ni \nless than about 200 nM; NET inhibition K\ni \nless than about 50 nM; or H1 that has a K\ni \nin the range of about at least half the value of the K\ni \nfor NET to greater than the K\ni \nfor NET.\n\n\nIn another aspect, it is desirable to identify a compound having potent inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter (NET), moderate D2 receptor antagonism and reduced affinity at secondary targets (e.g., H1, M1) relative to NET.\n\n\nIn a more particular aspect, it is desirable to identify a compound with potent NET inhibition (uptake K\ni\n<50 nM) moderate D2 antagonist potency (GTPγIC\n50\n<500 nM) and H1 Ki equivalent to or less than NET Ki.\n\n\nWe have identified and herein describe a compound, 2-fluoro-11-piperazin-1-yl-dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine, that has not been previously described, having the desirable properties described above.\n\n\nThus, a pharmacologically active compound 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, prodrugs thereof, compositions containing the compound, a prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and methods of treating bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with the compound, a prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are described herein.\n\n\nThus, provided herein is a compound of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein Z is H, —C(═O)—R\n1\n, —C(═O)OR\n1\n, —C(═O)OCH\n2\n, —CH(R\n1\n)—NHC(═O)R\n2\n, —C(═O)OCHR\n2\nOC(═O)R\n3\n, —CR\n1\n═CR\n2 \nor —CH═CHC(═O)R\n4\n, wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare each independently at each occurrence alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl or are as further described herein.\n\n\n\nAlso provided herein is at least one composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Particularly, provided herein are methods for treating psychiatric disorders comprising administering to a mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula II\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n\nYet further provided herein are methods of treating bipolar disorder, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, or anxiety disorders, comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or Formula II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Particularly, provided herein are methods of treating bipolar disorder, a mood disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, or anxiety disorder, comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof\n\n\nStill yet further provided herein is a compound of Formula I or Formula II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in treating schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, an anxiety disorder, and/or a mood disorder.\n\n\nAdditionally provided herein is a compound of Formula I or Formula II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, and/or a mood disorder.\n\n\nStill yet additionally provided herein are processes for preparing compounds of Formula I or Formula II, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, intermediates useful for the preparation of such compounds and processes for preparing and using such intermediates.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n\n\nProvided herein are compounds of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein Z is H, —C(═O)—R\n1\n, —C(═O)OR\n1\n, —C(═O)OCH\n2\n, —CH(R\n1\n)—NHC(═O)R\n2\n, —C(═O)OCHR\n2\nOC(═O)R\n3\n, —CR\n1\n═CR\n2 \nor —CH═CHC(═O)R\n4\n, wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare each independently at each occurrence alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl or are as further described herein.\n\n\n\nSpecifically provided herein is a compound of Formula I wherein Z is H of Formula II:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nreferred to herein as 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\n\nThe compounds disclosed herein can be prepared by processes described herein by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds can be synthesized using the methods described herein, using synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. The starting materials and precursors used in the processes described herein are either commercially available, or readily prepared by established organic synthesis methods, or as described herein. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Such restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and alternate methods should then be used.\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 1, an amide compound of the present invention (formula 1-3) can be prepared by reacting the compound of Example 1 herein with an acid or acid derivative 1-2 (wherein X\n1 \nis OH or a leaving group such as bromo, chloro, 4-nitrophenoxy, OC(═O)R\n1\n, and the like; and R\n1 \ncan be alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like) under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in art of organic synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, coupling of the amine compound 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine 1-1 to an acid compound 1-2 (wherein X\n1 \nis OH) can be carried out by a conventional amide bond formation method such as using a coupling reagent. Various suitable coupling reagents can be used to facilitate the coupling reaction of amide-bond formation. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize such coupling reagents. Some non-limiting examples of suitable coupling reagents include, but are not limited to, benzotriazole-containing coupling reagents such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), and 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); an azabenzotriazole-containing reagent such as O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU); and dicarboimides such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), and dicyclohexyl carbodimide (DCC). The coupling reaction can be carried out in a suitable organic solvent. Some suitable organic solvents include polar organic solvents such as an alcohol (such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol), or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Some suitable organic solvents include aprotic solvents. Some suitable organic solvents include polar aprotic organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or methylene chloride. The coupling reaction can be carried out in the presence of a suitable base and at a suitable temperature for a time sufficient to afford the amide compound 1-3. Suitable bases include organic bases such as tertiary amines (e.g., triethylamine (Et\n3\nN or TEA), diisopropylethylamine (iPr\n2\nNEt or DIPEA) and/or dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)). In some embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated to an elevated temperature (i.e., above the room temperature). In some embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature of about 40° C., about 50° C., about 60° C., about 70° C., about 80° C., about 90° C., about 100° C., about 110° C., about 120° C., about 130° C., about 140° C., about 150° C., or about 160° C. The reaction progress can be monitored by conventional methods such as TLC or NMR.\n\n\nAlternatively, the acid 1-2 (wherein X\n1 \nis OH) can be converted to a more reactive acid derivative 1-2 (wherein X\n1 \nis bromo, chloro, 4-nitrophenoxy, OC(═O)R\n1\n, and the like) such as an acid chloride, ester, a (mixed) anhydride, and the acid derivative can be optionally separated. The acid derivative can further react with 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine 1-1 to form the amide 1-3 under suitable conditions such as in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., triethylamine or pyridine).\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 2, a carbamate compound of the present invention (formula 2-3) can be synthesized by reacting the compound of Example 1 herein, 2-1) with a chloroformate 2-2 (wherein R\n1 \ncan be alkyl, arylalkyl, and the like).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction of scheme 2 can be carried out in a suitable organic solvent such as a polar aprotic organic solvent (e.g., methylene chloride) and in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine (Et\n3\nN or TEA), diisopropylethylamine (iPr\n2\nNEt or DIPEA), pyridine, and/or dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)).\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 3, a carbamate compound of the present invention (formula 3-5) can be synthesized via 4-nitrophenyl carbonate intermediate 3-3.\n\n\n4-Nitrophenyl chloroformate 3-1 can be reacted with an alcohol 3-2 in a suitable organic solvent such as a polar aprotic organic solvent (e.g., chloroform) and in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine (Et\n3\nN or TEA), diisopropylethylamine (iPr\n2\nNEt or DIPEA), pyridine, and/or dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)) to form a 4-nitrophenyl carbonate intermediate 3-3. The intermediate 3-3 can be reacted with 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine 3-4 in a suitable organic solvent such as a polar aprotic organic solvent (e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide) to form the carbamate 3-5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 4, a carbamate compound of the present invention (formula 4-4) can be synthesized by reacting a compound of Example 1 herein, (4-1) with a chloroformate 4-2 or a 4-nitrophenyl carbonate compound 4-3 (wherein R\n2 \ncan be H, methyl, and the like; and R\n3 \ncan be alkyl (e.g., methyl or ethyl), alkoxy, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactions can be carried out in similar conditions to those described in Schemes 2 and 3. The chloroformates 4-2 can be made by those skilled in the art by using methods such as similar to one reported by Folkmann et al., Synthesis, 1990, 1159-1166. The nitrophenyl carbonates 4-3 can be made by those skilled in the art by using methods such as similar to one reported by Alexander and co-workers in J. Med. Chem., 1988, 31, 318-322. Each of the references is incorporated herein by its entirety.\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 5, using a similar method to those reported by Lin et al., Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1997, 7, 2909-2912, a carbamate compound of the present invention (formula 5-3) can be prepared by reacting a compound of Example 1 herein, 5-1 with a compound of formula 5-2 (wherein X is a leaving group such as iodo, bromo or chloro; R\n2 \ncan be H, methyl, and the like; and R\n3 \ncan be alkyl (e.g., methyl or ethyl), alkoxy, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like) in the presence of carbon dioxide and a suitable base such as cesium carbonate and in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide. Similarly, the compound of formula 5-5 can be prepared from a compound of Example 1, 5-1 and a compound of formula 5-4 (wherein X\n1 \nis a leaving group such as iodo, bromo, chloro or 4-nitrophenylcarbonate) in the presence of carbon dioxide and a suitable base such as cesium carbonate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 6, an enamine compound of the present invention (formula 6-3) can be synthesized by reacting 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine 6-1 with a ketone or aldehyde 6-2 (wherein R\n1 \ncan be H, alkyl, and the like; and R\n2 \ncan be H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like). The reaction can be carried out under a suitable condition such as in the presence of a catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic acid and using a Dean-Stark trap to remove the water generated, and in a suitable organic solvent such as benzene or toluene. A novel enamine compound of the present invention (formula 6-5) can be synthesized by reacting 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine 6-1 with an alkynone 6-4 (wherein R\n4 \ncan be alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like) under a suitable condition such as reflux in a suitable organic solvent such as ethyl acetate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 7, a novel Mannich-base-type compound of the present invention (formula 7-4) can be prepared by reacting a compound of Example 1 herein, 7-1 with an aldehyde 7-2 (wherein R\n1 \ncan be H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like) and a nucleophile such as an amide 7-3 (wherein R\n2 \ncan be alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, and the like) under suitable conditions such as reflux. For example, 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine, formaldehyde aqueous solution and an amide 7-3 can be heated to reflux in an alcohol solvent such as ethanol to form a compound of formula 7-4 wherein R\n1 \nis H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should noted that in all of the schemes described herein, if there are functional (reactive) groups present on a substituent group such as R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, etc., further modification can be made if appropriate and/or desired. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide group; a carboxylic acid can be converted to an amide; a carboxylic acid can be converted to an ester, which in turn can be reduced to an alcohol, which in turn can be further modified. In another example, an OH group can be converted into another leaving group such as mesylate, which in turn is suitable for nucleophilic substitution, such as by CN. One skilled in the art will recognize further such modifications. Thus, a compound of formula I having a substituent that contains a functional group can be converted to another compound of formula I having a different substituent group.\n\n\nThe definitions set forth in this application are intended to clarify terms used throughout this application. The term “herein” means the entire application.\n\n\nA variety of compounds in the present invention may exist in particular stereoisomeric forms. The present invention takes into account all such compounds, including cis- and trans isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as being covered within the scope of this invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention. The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. When required, separation of the racemic material can be achieved by methods known in the art. The optically active forms of the compound of the invention may be prepared, for example, by chiral chromatographic separation of a racemate, by synthesis from optically active starting materials or by asymmetric synthesis based on the procedures described hereafter.\n\n\nWhere the compounds contain chiral centres, all individual optical forms such as enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers, as well as racemic mixtures of the compounds are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nOptical isomers can be obtained in pure form by standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, and include, but are not limited to, diastereomeric salt formation, kinetic resolution, and asymmetric synthesis. See, for example, Jacques et al., Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions (Wiley Interscience, New York, 1981); Wilen et al., Tetrahedron, 1977, 33, 2725; Eliel, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw-Hill, NY, 1962); Wilen, S. H. Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions p. 268 (E. L. Eliel, Ed., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, Ind. 1972), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It is also understood that this invention encompasses all possible regioisomers, and mixtures thereof, which can be obtained in pure form by standard separation procedures known to those skilled in the art, and include, but are not limited to, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated that certain compounds of the present invention may exist as geometrical isomers, for example E and Z isomers of alkenes. A compound of the present invention, 2-fluoro-11-piperazin-1-yl-dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine, can in theory exist in (E) or (Z) forms, however (E)-2-fluoro-11-piperazin-1-yl-dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine has been the observed form. The invention nevertheless includes any geometrical isomer of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “aryl” refers to an aromatic ring structure made up of from 5 to 14 carbon atoms. Ring structures containing 5, 6, 7, and 8 carbon atoms would be single-ring aromatic groups, for example, phenyl. Ring structures containing 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 would be a polycyclic moiety in which at least one carbon is common to any two adjoining rings therein (for example, the rings are “fused rings”), for example naphthyl. The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more ring positions with such substituents as described above. The term “aryl” also includes polycyclic ring systems having two or more cyclic rings in which two or more carbons are common to two adjoining rings (the rings are “fused rings”) wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic, for example, the other cyclic rings can be cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls or cycloalkynyls. The terms ortho, meta and para apply to 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-disubstituted benzenes, respectively. For example, the names 1,2-dimethylbenzene and ortho-dimethylbenzene are synonymous.\n\n\nAs used herein, “alkyl”, “alkylenyl” or “alkylene” used alone or as a suffix or prefix, is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or if a specified number of carbon atoms is provided then that specific number would be intended. For example “C\n1-6 \nalkyl” denotes alkyl having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl, or any subset thereof. As used herein, “C\n1-3 \nalkyl”, whether a terminal substituent or an alkylene (or alkylenyl) group linking two substituents, is understood to specifically include both branched and straight-chain methyl, ethyl, and propyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, “alkoxy” or “alkyloxy” represents an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. Examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, t-butoxy, n-pentoxy, isopentoxy, cyclopropylmethoxy, allyloxy, and propargyloxy, or any subset thereof. Similarly, “alkylthio” or “thioalkoxy” represent an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through a sulfur bridge.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is associated with an acidic or basic counter ion. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from mineral acids such as, for example: hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydroiodic acid, nitrous acid, and phosphorous acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be developed with organic acids including aliphatic mono dicarboxylates and aromatic acids. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, hydrochloride, sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, acetic, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, salicylic, 2-phenoxybenzoic, p-toluenesulfonic acid and other sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid and 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid.\n\n\nCompounds may exist in a number of tautomeric forms and references to compounds include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by the scope of this invention.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may include hydrates and solvates. It will also be understood that certain compounds of the present invention may exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated forms. It will further be understood that the present invention encompasses all such solvated forms of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nDerivatives that are prodrugs of a compound are convertible in vivo or in vitro into parent compound. Typically, at least one of the biological activities of compound will be reduced in the prodrug form of the compound, and can be activated by conversion of the prodrug to release the compound or a metabolite of it.

For preparing pharmaceutical compositions, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. For example, compositions can be formulated by means known in the art into the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, gels, nasal sprays, suppositories, finely divided powders or aerosols or nebulisers for inhalation, and for parenteral use (including intravenous, intramuscular or infusion) sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions or sterile emulsions.\n\n\nLiquid form compositions include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Sterile water or water-propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds may be mentioned as an example of liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid compositions can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavoring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art.\n\n\nSolid form compositions include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances that may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material.\n\n\nIn powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.\n\n\nFor preparing suppository compositions, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds and allowed to cool and solidify.\n\n\nSuitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.\n\n\nThe term composition is also intended to include the formulation of the active component with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier which is, thus, in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be in unit dosage form. In such form, the composition is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparations, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms. Methods of preparing dosage forms are disclosed in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975.\n\n\nCompositions may be formulated for any suitable route and means of administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, epidural, intraperitoneally, intrathoracically, intracerebroventricularly, and by injection into the joints) administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nA particular amount of a compound of Formula I or Formula II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered in an amount that ranges from about 0.25 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. More particularly, it is contemplated that a patient may be treated with about 0.25 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg of 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Most particularly, it is contemplated that a patient suffering with bipolar disorder may be treated with about 0.25 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Still more particularly it is contemplated that a patient suffering with a depressive phase of bipolar disorder may be treated with a lower amount in the range of about 0.25 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof whereas a patient suffering with a manic phase of bipolar disorder may be treated with a higher amount in the range of about 0.25 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nThe amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. The size of the therapeutically effective dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of the active compound(s) will naturally vary from the guidance provided herein according to the nature and severity of the symptoms or conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine. A clinician may readily determine the effective amount by using numerous methods already known in the art and all such effective amounts are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nFurther provided herein are methods of treating, comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or Formula II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a mammal, afflicted with at least one symptom or condition associated with a Psychiatric Disorder.

Briefly, D-Amphetamine-induced Hyperlocomotor Activity (LMA) in a Habituated Rat Model can be assessed in male Long Evans rats using a paradigm that includes a habituation phase followed by administration of 1 mg/kg D-amphetamine. Animals can be allowed to acclimatize to the testing room for 1 hour before being weighed and placed into activity chambers. Thirty minutes after LMA measurement is begun, animals can be briefly removed, dosed via the sub-cutaneous route (s.c.) with vehicle or test drug at different doses and returned to the chambers. After a further 30 minutes, animals can again be removed and dosed with vehicle or D-amphetamine at 1 mg/kg (s.c.). After returning the animals to the activity chambers, LMA can be assessed for a further 60 minutes. Haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg dissolved in H\n2\nO) can be administered 15 minutes prior to D-amphetamine via the s.c. route. Statistical analysis can be made of total distance traveled after D-amphetamine administration using ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc analysis where appropriate. All values can be expressed as Mean and SD.

Daily sessions can consist of up to 80 trials. If a shock is delivered, animals have the opportunity to escape the shock by traversing to the opposite side of the cage. Drug can be administered (via s.c. or p.o. route) 60 minutes prior to testing and the percentage of trials in which shock is avoided and escaped can be recorded. When this method was carried out generally as described therein, 2-fluoro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine showed activity at 30 mg/kg and at 60 mg/kg (sc).\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nNorepinephrine Uptake\n\n\nAn assay for measuring norepinephrine uptake can be carried out as described below. Briefly, test compounds can be evaluated in an 11-point IC\n50 \ncurve for their ability to inhibit uptake of a proprietary fluorescent substrate (dye) from Molecular Devices that mimics biogenic amine neurotransmitters. A stable population of HEK293F cells transfected with the human norepinephrine transporter (cultured in Freestyle 293 expression medium with 75 mg/ml hygromycin B) can be cryopreserved, then plated and used on the day of the assay.

A pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to \nclaim 1\n, in combination with a pharmaceutically effective excipient.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n17. A method of inhibiting Aurora kinases A and B, comprising administering an inhibiting amount of the compound according to \nclaim 1\n. Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates in particular to novel chemical compounds, particularly novel substituted dihydropyridine-fused heterocycles, to the compositions containing them and to their use as medicinal products.\n\n\nMore particularly, the invention relates to specific partially saturated pyrrole or pyrazole fused 5-oxo-hexahydronaphthyridines or 5-oxo-hexahydroquinolines, exhibiting anticancer activity via modulation of the activity of proteins, in particular of kinases.\n\n\nTo date, most of the commercial compounds used in chemotherapy are cytotoxic agents, which poses considerable problems of side effects and of tolerance in patients. These effects may be limited in so far as the medicinal products used act selectively on cancer cells, with exclusion of healthy cells. One of the solutions for limiting the adverse effects of chemotherapy may therefore consist in using medicinal products which act on metabolic pathways or elements constituting these pathways, expressed mainly in cancer cells, and which would be expressed very little or not at all in healthy cells.\n\n\nProtein kinases are a family of enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of specific protein residues such as tyrosine, serine or threonine residues. Such phosphorylations can widely modify the function of proteins; thus, protein kinases play an important role in regulating a large variety of cell processes, including in particular metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration or cell survival. Among the various cellular functions in which the activity of a protein kinase is involved, certain processes represent attractive targets for treating cancer-related diseases and also other diseases.\n\n\nThus, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide compositions having anticancer activity, acting in particular with respect to kinases. Among the kinases for which modulation of the activity is sought, Aurora A and B are preferred. The use of Aurora kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents has recently been reviewed in “aurora kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents, N. Keen and S. Taylor, Nature Reviews 2004, 4, 927-936.\n\n\nMany proteins involved in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly have been identified in yeast and \ndrosophila\n. Disorganization of these proteins leads to non-segregation of chromosomes and to monopolar or disorganized spindles. Among these proteins, some kinases, including Aurora and Ipl1, which originate respectively from \ndrosophila \nand \nS. cerevisiae\n, are necessary for chromosome segregation and separation of the centrosome. A human analogue of yeast Ipl1 has recently been cloned and characterized by various laboratories. This kinase, called Aurora2, Aurora A, STK15 or BTAK, belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family. Bischoff et al. have shown that Aurora2 is oncogenic and is amplified in human colorectal cancers (EMBO J, 1998, 17, 3052-3065). Examples of this have also been shown in cancers involving epithelial tumours, such as breast cancer.\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that one of the advantages of the current invention is to provide quite selective compounds. Indeed, these compounds mostly avoid inhibiting kinases involved in cellular transcription, which may result in severe side effects and/or higher toxicity towards quiescent cells. As a result, the compounds according to the invention mostly avoid inhibiting CDK7 and/or CDK9 kinases, or at least the inhibition ratio is in favour of an Aurora kinase.\n\n\nThe following corresponds to Applicant's believed closest prior art search for compounds of formulas (I) and (II) according to the invention:\n\n \n \nDrizin, Irene; Holladay, Mark W.; Yi, Lin; Zhang, Henry Q.; Gopalakrishnan, Sujatha; Gopalakrishnan, Murali; Whiteaker, Kristi L.; Buckner, Steven A.; Sullivan, James P.; Carroll, William A. “Structure-Activity studies for a novel series of tricyclic dihydropyrimidines as KATP channel openers (KCOs)”.

Compounds eluting off the column are detected by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (EIMS).\n\n\nAnalytical LC/MS Method B:\n\n\nAnalysis is conducted on Waters model ZQ mass spectrometer working in positive and negative ion electrospray mode (mass range=100-1200 amu) fitted on a Agilent HP1100 HPLC instrument. Separation is done on a Waters Xbridge C18 column (3×50 mm, 2.5 μm particle diameter) maintained at a temperature of 60° C. and eluted by a gradient of acetronitrile in water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min. The gradient has the following shape: 5 to 100% acetonitrile in 5 minutes, maintain 100% acetonitrile for 0.5 minute, then back to 5% acetonitrile in 1 minute. Total run time is 7 minutes. In addition to mass spectrometry, UV diode array detection is performed at wavelengths=210 to 400 nM and evaporative light scattering is carried out using a Sedere Sedex 85 instrument.\n\n\nAnalytical LC/MS Method C:\n\n\nAnalysis is conducted on Waters model ZQ mass spectrometer working in positive and negative ion electrospray mode (mass range=100-1200 amu) fitted on a Waters Acquity UPLC Instrument. Separation is done on a Waters UPLC BeH C18 column (2.1×50 mm, 1.7 μm particle diameter) maintained at a temperature of 55° C. and eluted by a gradient of acetronitrile in water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The gradient has the following shape: 5 to 100% acetonitrile in 3 minutes, then back to 5% acetonitrile in 1 minute. Total run time is 4.5 minutes. In addition to mass spectrometry, UV diode array detection is performed at wavelengths=210 to 400 nM.\n\n\nPreparative LC/MS Method A:\n\n\nPreparative LC/MS separation were carried out on Waters HPLC instruments: 515 HPLC Pump; 2525 Binary Gradient Module; 2487 DAD (Dual Absorbance Detector); 2767 sample Manager connected with a Micromass mass spectrometer. Products were separated on a YMC Combi Prep Pro C18 column eluted with a gradient acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA in water containing 0.1% TFA of flow rate 32 ml/min. For each separation gradient programation is adapted on the basis of an analytical LC/MS chromatogram of the sample.\n\n\nPreparative LC/MS Method B:\n\n\nCompounds are purified by LC/MS using a Waters FractionLynx system composed of a Waters model 600 gradient pump, a Waters model 515 regeneration pump, a Waters Reagent Manager make-up pump, a Waters model 2700 autoinjector, two Rheodyne model LabPro switches, a Waters model 996 photodiode array detector, a Waters model ZMD mass spectrometer and a Gilson model 204 fraction collector. The instrument is controlled by a Waters FractionLynx software. At the output of the separating column the flow is split to the 1/1000 ratio using a LC Packing AccuRate splitter; 1/1000 of the flow is mixed with methanol (0.5 ml/min. flow rate) and sent to the detectors, this flow is split again: ¾ of the flow is sent to the photodiode array detector and ¼ to the mass spectrometer; the rest of the output of the column (999/1000) is sent to the fraction collector where flow wis directed normally to waste unless expected mass signal is detected by the FractionLynx software. The FractionLynx software is supplied with molecular formulas of expected compounds and trigger the collection of compounds when mass signal corresponding to [M+H]\n+\n and [M+Na]\n+\n are detected. In certain cases (depending on analytical LC/MS result, when [M+2H]\n++\n is detected as an intense ion) the FractionLynx software is additionally supplied with calculated half molecular weight (MW/2), in these conditions collection is also triggered when mass signal corresponding to [M+2H]\n++\n and [M+Na+H]\n++\n are detected. Compounds are collected in tarred glass tubes. After collection, solvent is evaporated in a Jouan model RC 10.10 centrifuge evaporator and the weight of compound is determined by weighing of the tubes after solvent evaporation.

The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. A solution of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde (1.04 g, 7.38 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) is then added dropwise over a 15 minute period and the mixture is stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. Water (10 ml) is then added and the reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in a minimal volume of ethyl acetate and is filtered through a silica gel plug (20 ml) that is eluted with 500 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic filtrates are concentrated under reduced pressure and are purified on a silicagel column (120 g) eluted with a mixture of cyclohexane and ethyl acetate (7/3, v/v) to yield 1.4 g of 5-[5-(tert-butyl-dimethyl-silanyloxy)-1H-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl]-furan-2-carbaldehyde as a brown oil.

Aurora B and A)\n\n\nThe inhibitory effect of compounds with respect to the Aurora 1 and 2 kinases is determined with a radioactivity scintillation assay using nickel chelate.\n\n\nThe kinase activity of Aurora is measured by the phosphorylation of NuMA-histidine substrate in the presence of radiolabelled ATP ([\n33\nP] ATP) using 96 well Flash plates where the nickel-chelate is linked to the surface of the microplate. The amount of \n33\nP incorporated to the substrate NuMA is proportional to the aurora activity.\n\n\nProteins:\n\n\nThe protein production has been made in the protein production group of Sanofi-Aventis.\n\n \n \n \n \nAurora-A: the full length recombinant protein including an N-terminal poly-histidine tail has been expressed in \nE. coli \nand purified to 82%.\n \nAurora-B: the full length protein (His tagged in N-terminal) has been co expressed in SF9 cells with the C3 fragment of INCEP protein fused to GST protein. The complex has been purified using the N-terminal poly-histidine tail to 50% homogeneity.\n \nNuMA, (a nuclear protein which binds to the mitotic system): fragment of 424 amino acids (position 1687-2101) has been expressed in \nE. coli \n(tagged on the N-terminal end with a poly-histidine tail for use as a the substrate for both Aurora enzymes.\n\n\nProtocol:\n\n \n \n \n\n\nThe Flash plates used are nickel-chelate 96 well plates (Perkin Elmer, model SMP107).\n\n\nThe products to be evaluated are incubated in a 100 μl reaction volume per well in the presence of 10 nM of Aurora-B or Aurora-A, 500 nM of NuMA substrate in the following buffer: 50 mM of NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, (Aurora-B) or 10 mM MgCl2 (Aurora-A) and 1 mM of DTT at 37° C.\n\n\n80 μL of enzyme/substrate incubation buffer is distributed in each well, followed by 10 μL of solution of compound to be measured with various concentrations. The reaction is started by adding 1 μM of ATP (final concentration) containing 0.2 μCi of [\n33\nP] ATP (10 μL). After 30 minutes of incubation the reaction is stopped by removal of the reaction mixture and each well is washed twice with 300 μl of buffer Tris/HCl. The radioactivity is measured in each well using a Packard Top count scintillation counter instrument.\n\n\nThe enzymatic activity is expressed as counts per minute obtained in 30 minutes after subtraction of the background noise (reaction medium without enzyme). The measurement is expressed as percentage of inhibition of Aurora activity versus the control. To generate IC50 values, compounds of the invention are tested at different concentration and the percentage of inhibition are plotted as function of compound concentration, IC50s are calculated using the Xlfit 4 curve fitting software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample #\n\n\nAurora2 IC50 (nM)\n\n\nAurora1 IC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
