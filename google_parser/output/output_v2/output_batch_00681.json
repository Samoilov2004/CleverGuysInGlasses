Description\n\n\n\n\n FUSED IMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS TRPV3 ANTAGONIST\n\n\nRelated applications\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of Indian Provisional Applications 2705/MUM/2008, filed on Dec 26, 2008; 1732/MUM/2009, filed on July 29, 2009; and U.S. Provisional Applications 61/146,865, filed on Jan 23, 2009; 61/237,434, filed on Aug 27, 2009; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nThe present patent application relates generally to fused imidazole derivatives with transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 (TRPV3) antagonist activity.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nMovement of ions across cellular membranes is carried out by specialized proteins. TRP channels are one large family of non-selective cation channels that function to help regulate ion flux and membrane potential. TRP channels are subdivided into 6 sub-families including the TRPV family. TRP V3 is a member of the TRPV class of TRP channels.\n\n\nTRPV3 is a calcium permeable channel, specifically a calcium permeable nonselective cation channel. In addition to calcium ions, TRPV3 channels are permeable to other cations, for example sodium. Thus, TRPV3 channels modulate membrane potential by modulating the flux of cations such as calcium and sodium ions. TRP V3 receptors are mechanistically distinct from voltage-gated calcium channels. Generally, voltage-gated calcium channels respond to membrane depolarization and open to permit an influx of calcium from the extracellular medium that result in an increase in intracellular calcium levels or concentrations. In contrast, TRP channels which are nonselective cation channels are generally ligand gated (such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate [2 -APB], heat, and vanilloids), long lasting, and produce more prolonged changes in ion concentration. These mechanistic differences are accompanied by structural differences among voltage-gated and TRP channels. Thus, although many diverse channels act to regulate ion flux and membrane potential in various cell types and in response to numerous stimuli, it is important to recognize the significant structural, functional, and mechanistic differences among different classes of ion channels. \n\n TRPV3 proteins are thermosensitive channels expressed in skin cells (Peier et al. Science (2002), 296, 2046-2049) and dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord and brain (Xu et al. Nature (2002), 418, 181-185; Smith et al. Nature (2002), 418. 186-188). TRPV3 is also highly expressed in skin. In a keratinocyte cell line, stimulation of TRP V3 leads to release of inflammatory mediators including interleukin-1. Thus TRPV3 may also play an important role in regulating inflammation and pain that results from the release of inflammatory stimuli. Particular TRPV3 proteins that may be used in screening assays, as described herein, to identity compounds that modulate a function of TRP V3 include, but are not limited to human TRP V3, mouse TRPV3, rat TRP V3 and Drosophila TRP V3. US 2004/0009537 (the '537 application) disclosed sequences corresponding to human, mouse, and Drosophila TRP V3. For example, SEQ ID Nos 106 and 107 of the '537 application correspond to the human nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, respectively. SEQ ID Nos 108 and 109 of the '537 application correspond to the mouse nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, respectively.\n\n\nTRPV3 function has been basically implicated in the reception and transduction of pain. Accordingly, it would be desirable to identify and make compounds that can modulate one or more functions of TRPV3.\n\n\nWO 2007/056124, WO 2006/017995, WO 2008/140750, and WO 2008/033564 disclose TRPV3 modulators, in particularly antagonists, for treatment of various diseases mediated TRPV3. WO 2006/065686 and WO 2007/042906 disclose benzopyran derivatives; WO 2009/084034, WO 2009/109987 and WO 2009/130560 applications disclose diferrent scaffolds for TRPV3 modulators, particularly related to TRPV3 antagonist.\n\n\nIn efforts to discover better analgesics, there still exists a need for therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRP V3.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nIn accordance with one aspect, the present patent application provides compounds of the formula (I) with TRP V3 antagonistic activity: \n\n \n\n\n wherein, at each occurrence, X is independently selected from C or N, when X is N optionally oxidized to form N oxide; at each occurrence, R\n1\n is independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, -S(O)\nP\nR\n5\n (where p is 1 or 2), and -SO\n2\nNR\n5\nR\n6\n;\n\n\n'm' is an integer ranging from 1 to 4, both inclusive;\n\n\nQ is hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl; wherein substituents, may be one or more and are independently selected from halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano, amino, COOR\na\n, C(O)NR\n5\nR\n6\n, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, and cycloalkoxy;\n\n\nR\n2\n and R\n3\n, may be same or different, are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heterocyclic group, and heterocyclylalkyl; at each occurrence, R\n4\n is independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano, amino, -COOR\na\n, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl; at each occurrence, R\na\n is indepedently hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl; at each occurrence, R\n5\n and R\n6\n, may be same or different, are independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, and heteroarylalkyl; and \n\n 'n' is an integer ranging from 1 to 3, both inclusive; or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, there is provided a compound of the formula (II):\n\n\n \n\n wherein, at each occurrence, R\n1\n is independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, -S(O)\nP\nR\n5\n (where p is 1 or 2), and -SO\n2\nNR\n5\nR\n6\n;\n\n\n'm' is an integer ranging from 1 to 4, both inclusive;\n\n\nQ is hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl; wherein substituents, may be one or more and are independently selected from halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano, amino, COOR\na\n, C(O)NR\n5\nR\n6\n, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, and cycloalkoxy;\n\n\nR\na\n is hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl;\n\n\nR\n2\n and R\n3\n, may be same or different, are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heterocyclic group, and heterocyclylalkyl; and at each occurrence, R\n5\n and R\n6\n, may be same or different, are independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, and heteroarylalkyl; or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (II) in which R\n1\n is halogen, (for example F, Cl or Br), alkyl (for example \n\n methyl), alkoxy (for example methoxy), haloalkyl (for example trifluoromethyl), or haloalkoxy (for example difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy); and 'm' is 0, 1, 2 or 3.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (II) in which Q is substituted or unsubstituted aryl, preferably phenyl.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (II) in which Q is substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl, preferably benzyl.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (II) in which Q is substituted or unsubstituted aryl (for example phenyl), arylalkyl (for example benzyl), heteroaryl, preferably pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, thiophene, thiazole, benzothiazole.

Additional diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPV3 is illustrated, for example in WO2007/056124; Wissenbach, U. et al, Biology of the cell (2004), 96, 47-54; Nilius, B. et al., Physiol Rev (2007), 87, 165-217; Okuhara, D. Y. et al, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets (2007), U, 391-401; Hu, H. Z. et al, Journal of Cellular Physiology, (2006), 208, 201-212 and references cited therein, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for the purpose stated.\n\n\nGeneral Methods of Preparation\n\n\nThe compounds described herein may be prepared by techniques known in the art. In addition, the compounds described herein may be prepared by following the reaction sequence as depicted in Schemes 1 to 3. Further, in the following schemes, where specific bases, acids, reagents, solvents, coupling agents, etc. are mentioned, it is understood that other bases, acids, reagents, solvents, coupling agents etc. known in the art may also be used and are therefore included within the scope of the present invention. Variations in reaction conditions, for example, temperature and/or duration of the reaction, which may be used as known in the art are also within the scope of the present invention. All the isomers of the compounds in described in these schemes, unless otherwise specified, are also encompassed within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nThe compound of the present invention represented by the general formula (I), where R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, Q, X, m, and n are as described previously, can be prepared as described in Scheme 1. Thus, intermediate of the formula (1) (e.g., 2-nitroaniline, 2-amino-3- nitropyridine, 4-amino-3-nitropyridine) is coupled with 2,3-dialkoxycinnamyl chloride of the formula (2) in the presence of a suitable base to give amide of the formula (3). The \n\n nitro group in intermediate (3) is reduced using a reducing agent such as iron and acetic acid to give intermediate of the formula (4). Intermediate (4) is cyclised to the benzimidazole derivative (5) by a dehydration reaction under strongly acidic reaction conditions. Altermatively, compound of formula (5) can be prepared by reductive cyclization of compound of formula (3) using reducing agents such as Raney nickel or iron and acetic acid. Copper (I) assisted coupling of (5) with an intermediate of the formula (6), where L is leaving group such as halogen, gives compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I). Compounds of the general formula (I) where Q is a benzyl group can be prepared by direct alkylation of intermediate (5) with a benzyl halide in the presence of a strong base such as cesium carbonate. In some cases, the compound of formula (I) (when R\n2\n is alkyl) can be selectively dealkylated in presence of Lewis acid such as boron tribromide in dichloromethane or HBr in acetic acid to give compound of general formula (Ia).\n\n\nScheme 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of general formula (I), where R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, Q, X, m, and n are as described previously, can also be prepared by an alternative approach as shown in Scheme 2. In this approach, intermediate of formula (Ia) is coupled with an intermediate of the formula (6) prior to the cyclization step. Thus, intermediate (Ia) is treated with intermediate (6) where L is preferably Cl, Br or I in the presence of a suitable base to \n\n give the coupled product (7). The nitro group of intermediate (7) is reduced using reducing agents such as iron and acetic acid to obtain intermediate (8) which is coupled with 2,3-dialkoxycinnamyl chloride of the formula (2) in the presence of a suitable base to give amide of the formula (9). Cyclization of intermediate (9) in presence of a suitable acid such as acetic acid gives compounds of the present invention represented by the formula (I).\n\n\nScheme 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of general formula (I), where R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, Q, X, m, and n are as described previously can also be prepared as shown in Scheme 3. Thus, intermediate of the formula (10) where L is a halogen, preferably Cl or Br on reaction with an amine of the formula (11) in the presence of a suitable base furnishes compound of the formula (7). The nitro group of the intermediate (7) is reduced using reducing agents such as iron and acetic acid to obtain intermediate (8) which is coupled with 2,3-dialkoxycinnamyl chloride of the formula (2) in the presence of a suitable base to give amide of the formula (9). Cyclization of intermediate (9) in presence of a suitable acid such as acetic acid gives compound of the present invention represented by the formula (I).\n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting raw materials and reagents required for the syntheses of intermediates and compounds of invention are commercially available (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich) or can be prepared according to methods known to one skilled in the art or by methods available in the literature.

M. Life Sciences (2003), 73, 487-498. The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to a person skilled in the art. Such screening methods may be found in (a) Hu, H. -Z. et al J. Biol. Chem. (2004), 279, 35741-35747; (b) Smith, G. D. et al Nature (2002), 418, 186-190; (c) Peier, A. M. et al Science (2002), 296, 2046-2049.\n\n\nScreening for TRPV3 antagonist using the \n45\nCalcium uptake assay\n\n\nThe inhibition of TRPV3 receptor activation was followed as inhibition of 2- aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2 -APB) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium. Test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare 20 mM stock solution and then diluted using plain medium with DMEM/ F-12 containing 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n to get desired concentration. Final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPV3 expressing CHO cells were grown in DMEM/ F-12 medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 400 μg / ml of G-418. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with test compounds for 10 minutes followed by addition of 2-APB at a final concentration of 500 μM and 5 μCi/ml \n45\nCa\n+2\n for 4 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % \n\n deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in Packardt Top count after addition of liquid scintillant. Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. IC50 value was calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.\n\n\nThe compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 4. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 μM and 10.0 μM are given in the table along with IC50 details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 4 wherein \"A\" refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM, \"B\" refers to IC\n50\n value in range of 50.01 to 100.0 nM and \"C\" refers to an IC\n50\n value in range of 100.01 to 500.0 nM and \"D\" refers to IC\n50\n values above 500.0 nM.\n\n\nTable 4: In- vitro screening results of compounds of invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention.
