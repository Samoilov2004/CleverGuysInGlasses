CA123329, CA113917, and CA88343 awarded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health of the United States government. The government has certain rights in the invention\n\n\nFIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\n[0003] The present disclosure relates to the manufacture of aptamers incorporating boronic acids, and having enhanced affinity and specificity for glycosylated proteins. The disclosure further relates to methods of selectively detecting glycosylated species of proteins.\n\n\nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n[0004]The present disclosure includes a sequence listing incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n[0005] PosWco-translational modifications including phosphorylation, methylation, acyiation, ubiquitination, SUMOIyation, and glycosylation play critical roles in determining the functions and fates of proteins (Walsh, C, ed. Posttranslational Modification of Proteins: Expanding Nature's Inventory. 2006, Roberts & Co: Englewood, Colo). Among these modifications, glycosylation results in significant structural diversity and complexity of protein products. Usually, for the purpose of correlating glycosylation states with pathological changes, it is not a question of whether there is glycosylation, but rather the glycosylation pattern that marks protein function or different pathological states, including malignancy. For example, the glycosylation patterns of prostate specific antigen (PSA) from cancer cells in culture (Peracauia et al., (2003) Glycobiol. 13: 457-470) and prostate cancer patient's tissue and serum (Tabares et al., (2006) Glycobiology, 16(2): 132-145; Tabares et al., (2007) Clin. Biochem., 40: 343-350) are different from that of the normal prostate. Human pancreatic RNase 1 , a glycoprotein secreted mostly by \n\n pancreatic cells, has completely different oligosaccharide chains when produced from pancreatic tumor cells, and deviation from the normal glycosylation pattern on fibrinogen, a protein critical to blood coagulation, can lead to coagulation disorders (Cohn et al., (2006) Pediatrics 118: 514-521 ; Langer etal., (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263: 15056-15063; Gilman et al., (1984) J. Biol. Chem 259: 3248-3253; Hamano et al., (2004) Blood 103: 3045-3050; Mirshahi et al., (1987) Thromb. Res. 48: 279-289; Ridgway et al., (1997) Br. J. Haematol. 99: 562-569; Rybarczyk et al., (2000) Cancer Res. 60: 2033-2039; Sugo et al., (1999) Blood 94: 3806-3813). Pregnancy-related human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can provide biomarkers for cancer, Down syndrome, and pregnancy failure depending on its glycosylation patterns (Wang et al., (2002) Curr. Org. Chem. 6: 1285-1317; Gao et al., (2003) Org. Lett. 5: 4615- 4618); and specific glycosylation patterns of haptoglobin (Hp) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) have a much higher degree of correlation with cancer than the total Hp/AFP levels (Yang et al., (2004) Chem. Biol. 11: 439-448).\n\n\n[0006] Since certain glycoforms of these proteins are directly disease related, the ability to analyze and differentiate variations of glycosylation patterns in a given glycoprotein would be of value for the development of new diagnostics and biomedical research tools. Currently available analytical tools used for glycomics analysis include such as mass spectrometry, chromatography, especially capillary electrophoresis, antibody-based approaches, lectin profiling, and the like. However, there remains a need for techniques suitable for the rapid and accurate detection of protein glycosylation variations. Mass spectrometry and chromatography methods are time-consuming. Lectin profiling is useful for broad category glycan characterizations, but it only focuses on the glycan portion and does not give any indication as to the identity of the protein in question. As a result, purified or partially purified glycoproteins are usually needed for lectin-based characterizations in detail. Furthermore, cross-reactivity and low affinity are issues that may impede the application of lectins for highly specific characterizations. In addition, there are only about forty readily available lectins, which cannot satisfy the need for highly specific recognitions of various glycosylation patterns.\n\n\n[0007] Molecules that can recognize a target glycoprotein with high affinity and specificity should preferably recognize both the glycan and the protein portions to be useful for glycoform-specific detection. However, antibodies and aptamer selection for the development of molecules of high specificity and affinity for glycoproteins do not have the intrinsic ability to specifically focus on the glycosylation sites in its native form, and allow for the ready differentiation of glycosylation variations. \n\n [0008] Aptamer selection is a very powerful method for the development of custom-made nucleic acid-based high affinity \"binders\" (aptamers) for molecules of interest. Since the beginning of this field, a large number of aptamers have been reported for various applications with some in clinical trials or approved for clinical use. As powerful as the method is, aptamer selection has limited intrinsic ability to selectively focus on certain substructures of a large biomacromolecule. Therefore, methods for selection of aptamers that can recognize a glycoprotein and be able to differentiate its glycosylation patterns will be advantageous for the development of novel types of diagnostics and therapeutics as well as analytical tools for biomedical research.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\n[0009] Boronic acid-modified DNA-based aptamers can be selected to recognize fibrinogen through binding at a glycosylation site and thus are useful for probing the effect of glycosylation pattern changes on the ability for fibrinogen to mediate blood coagulation. In addition, the aptamers of the disclosure also have anticoagulation effects due to their binding to fibrinogen and its cleavage product fibrin.\n\n\n[0010] The present disclosure, therefore, encompasses methods for inhibiting fibrin coagulation, comprising contacting fibrinogen, or a derivative thereof, with an aptamer capable of specifically binding to a glycosylation site of fibrinogen or fibrin, where the aptamer includes at least one nucleotide having a boronic acid thereon, whereupon the aptamer selectively binds to fibrinogen, or the derivative thereof, thereby inhibiting fibrin coagulation.\n\n\n[0011] In embodiments of this aspect of the disclosure, the derivative of fibrinogen may be fibrin.\n\n\n[0012] In embodiments of the disclosure, the method may further comprise delivering the aptamer to an animal or human subject, thereby inhibiting a thrombus formation in the animal or human. In other embodiments of this method, the method may comprise delivering the aptamer to serum or whole blood sample, thereby inhibiting coagulation of the serum or blood sample.\n\n\n[0013] In one embodiment of the disclosure, the method may further comprise reversing the inhibition of fibrin coagulation by delivering to the fibrinogen, or derivative thereof, an oligonucleotide having a sequence capable of binding to the aptamer, thereby reducing the binding of the aptamer to the target glycosylation site of fibrinogen, or derivative thereof.\n\n\n[0014] Another aspect of the disclosure provides oligonucleotide aptamers comprising at least one nucleotide having a boronic acid thereon, where the aptamer is capable of selectively binding to a glycosylation site of fibrinogen, or the derivative \n\n thereof. In embodiments of this aspect of the disclosure, the derivative of fibrinogen can be fibrin.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0015] Many aspects of the disclosure can be better understood with reference to the following figures.

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present disclosure will be limited only by the appended claims.\n\n\n[0059] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range, is encompassed within the disclosure. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges and are also encompassed within the disclosure, \n\n subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure.\n\n\n[0060] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can also be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred methods and materials are now described.\n\n\n[0061] All publications and patents cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication or patent were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference and are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited. The citation of any publication is for its disclosure prior to the filing date and should not be construed as an admission that the present disclosure is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue of prior disclosure. Further, the dates of publication provided could be different from the actual publication dates that may need to be independently confirmed.\n\n\n[0062] As will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure, each of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components and features which may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any of the other several embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. Any recited method can be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order that is logically possible.\n\n\n[0063] Embodiments of the present disclosure will employ, unless otherwise indicated, techniques of medicine, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, pharmacology, and the like, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.\n\n\n[0064] It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \"a support\" includes a plurality of supports. In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings unless a contrary intention is apparent.\n\n\n[0065] As used herein, the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise. In this disclosure, \"comprises,\" \"comprising,\" \"containing\" and \"having\" and the like can have the meaning ascribed to them in U.S. patent law and can mean \" includes,\" \"including,\" and the like; \"consisting essentially of or \n\n \"consists essentially\" or the like, when applied to methods and compositions encompassed by the present disclosure refers to compositions like those disclosed herein, but which may contain additional structural groups, composition components or method steps (or analogs or derivatives thereof as discussed above). Such additional structural groups, composition components or method steps, etc., however, do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic^) of the compositions or methods, compared to those of the corresponding compositions or methods disclosed herein. \"Consisting essentially of or \"consists essentially\" or the like, when applied to methods and compositions encompassed by the present disclosure have the meaning ascribed in U.S. Patent law and the term is open- ended, allowing for the presence of more than that which is recited so long as basic or novel characteristics of that which is recited is not changed by the presence of more than that which is recited, but excludes prior art embodiments.\n\n\n[0066] Prior to describing the various embodiments, the following definitions are provided and should be used unless otherwise indicated. Definitions\n\n\n[0067] In describing and claiming the disclosed subject matter, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.\n\n\n[0068] The term \"aptamer\" as used herein refers to an isolated nucleic acid molecule that binds with high specificity and affinity to a target molecule, such as a protein, polypeptide, lipid, glycoprotein, glycolipid, glycopeptide, saccharide, or polysaccharide. An aptamer is a three-dimensional structure held in certain conformation(s) that provide intermolecular contacts to specifically bind its given target. Although aptamers are nucleic acid based molecules, there is a fundamental difference between aptamers and other nucleic acid molecules such as genes and mRNA. In the latter, the nucleic acid structure encodes information through its linear base sequence and thus this sequence is of importance to the function of information storage. In complete contrast, aptamer function, which is based upon the specific binding of a target molecule, is not entirely dependent on a linear base sequence (a non-coding sequence), but rather a particular secondary/tertiary/quaternary structure. Any coding potential that an aptamer may possess is generally entirely fortuitous and does not contribute to the binding of an aptamer to its cognate target.\n\n\n[0069] Aptamers must also be differentiated from the naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences that bind to certain proteins. These latter sequences generally are naturally occurring sequences embedded within the genome of the organism that bind to a specialized sub-group of proteins or polypeptides, or their derivatives, that are involved in the transcription, translation, and transportation of naturally occurring \n\n nucleic acids, i.e., protein-binding nucleic acids. Aptamers on the other hand are short, isolated, non-naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules. While aptamers can be identified that bind nucleic acid-binding proteins, in most cases such aptamers have little or no sequence identity to the sequences recognized by the nucleic acid- binding proteins in nature. More importantly, aptamers can be selected to bind virtually any protein (not just nucleic acid-binding proteins) as well as almost any target of interest including small molecules, carbohydrates, peptides, etc. For most targets, even proteins, a naturally occurring nucleic acid sequence to which it binds does not exist. For those targets that do have such a sequence, i.e., nucleic acid- binding proteins, such sequences will differ from aptamers as a result of the relatively low binding affinity used in nature as compared to tightly binding aptamers. Aptamers are capable of specifically binding to selected targets and modulating the target's activity or binding interactions, e.g., through binding, aptamers may block their target's ability to function. The functional property of specific binding to a target is an inherent property an aptamer.\n\n\n[0070] A typical aptamer is 6-35 kDa in size (20-100 nucleotides), binds its target with micromolar to sub-nanomolar affinity, and may discriminate against closely related targets (e.g., aptamers may selectively bind related proteins from the same gene family). Aptamers are capable of using intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic complementarities, hydrophobic contacts, and steric exclusion to bind with a specific target. In the present disclosure, aptamers also employ boronic acid-Lewis base/nucleophile (such as hydroxy I groups, diols, and amino groups) interactions for binding. Aptamers have a number of desirable characteristics for use as therapeutics and diagnostics including high specificity and affinity, low immunogenicity, biological efficacy, and excellent pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n\n[0071] The compounds described herein may be prepared as a single isomer (e.g., enantiomer, cis-trans, positional, diastereomer) or as a mixture of isomers. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are prepared as substantially a single isomer. Methods of preparing substantially isomerically pure compounds are known in the art. For example, enantiomericaily enriched mixtures and pure enantiomeric compounds can be prepared by using synthetic intermediates that are enantiomericaily pure in combination with reactions that either leave the stereochemistry at a chiral center unchanged or result in its complete inversion. Alternatively, the final product or intermediates along the synthetic route can be resolved into a single stereoisomer. Techniques for inverting or leaving unchanged a particular stereocenter, and those for resolving mixtures of stereoisomers are well \n\n known in the art and it is well within the ability of one of skill in the art to choose and appropriate method for a particular situation.

Res. 23: 128 (1990).\n\n\n[0072] Where a disclosed compound includes a conjugated ring system, resonance stabilization may permit a formal electronic charge to be distributed over the entire molecule. While a particular charge may be depicted as localized on a particular ring system, or a particular heteroatom, it is commonly understood that a comparable resonance structure can be drawn in which the charge may be formally localized on an alternative portion of the compound.\n\n\n[0073] Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents, which would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., - CH\n2\nO- is intended to also recite -OCH\n2\n-.\n\n\n[0074] The term \"acyl\" or \"alkanoyl\" by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and an acyl radical on at least one terminus of the alkane radical. The \"acyl radical\" is the group derived from a carboxylic acid by removing the -OH moiety therefrom.\n\n\n[0075] The term \"alkyl,\" by itself or as part of another substituent means, as used herein refers to a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include divalent (\"alkylene\") and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C\n1\n-C\n10\n means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n- propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3- (1 ,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. The term \"alkyl,\" unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives of alkyl defined in more detail below, such as \"heteroalkyl.\" Alkyl groups that are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed \"homoalkyl\". \n\n [0076] Exemplary alkyl groups of use in the present invention contain between about one and about twenty five carbon atoms (e.g. methyl, ethyl and the like). Straight, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon chains having eight or fewer carbon atoms will also be referred to herein as \"lower alkyl\". In addition, the term \"alkyl\" as used herein further includes one or more substitutions at one or more carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon chain fragment.\n\n\n[0077] The term \"amino\" or \"amine group\" as used herein refers to the group - NR\n1\nR\" (or NRR\n1\nR\") where R, R' and R\" are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aryl alkyl, substituted aryl alkyl, heteroaryl, and substituted heteroaryl. A substituted amine being an amine group wherein R' or R\" is other than hydrogen. In a primary amino group, both R' and R\" are hydrogen, whereas in a secondary amino group, either, but not both, R\n1\n or R\" is hydrogen. In addition, the terms \"amine\" and \"amino\" can include protonated and quaternized versions of nitrogen, comprising the group - NRR\n1\nR\" and its biologically compatible anionic counterions.\n\n\n[0078] The term \"aryl\" as used herein refers to cyclic aromatic carbon chain having twenty or fewer carbon atoms, e.g., phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, and anthracenyl. One or more carbon atoms of the aryl group may also be substituted with, e.g., alkyl; aryl; heteroaryl; a halogen; nitro; cyano; hydroxyl, alkoxyl or aryloxyl; thio or mercapto, alkyl-, or arylthio; amino, alkylamino, arylamino, dialkyl-, diaryl-, or arylalkylamino; aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, diarylaminocarbonyl, or arylalkylaminocarbonyi; carboxyl, or alkyl- or aryloxycarbonyl; aldehyde; aryl- or alkylcarbonyl; iminyl, or aryl- or alkyliminyl; sulfo; alkyl- or alkylcarbonyl; iminyl, or aryl- or alkyliminyl; sulfo; alkyl- or arylsulfonyl; hydroximinyl, or aryl- or alkoximinyl. In addition, two or more alkyl or heteroalkyl substituents of an aryl group may be combined to form fused aryl-alkyl or aryl-heteroalkyl ring systems (e.g., tetrahydronaphthyl). Substituents including heterocyclic groups (e.g., heteroaryloxy, and heteroaralkylthio) are defined by analogy to the above-described terms.\n\n\n[0079] The terms \"alkoxy,\" \"alkylamino\" and \"alkylthio\" (or thioalkoxy) as used herein are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.\n\n\n[0080] The term \"heteroalkyl,\" by itself or in combination with another term, means, as used herein refers to a straight or branched chain, or cyclic carbon- containing radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si, P, \n\n S, and Se and wherein the nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and selenium atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom is optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P, S, Si, and Se may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-O- CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n, -S(O)- CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-S(O)\n2\n-CH\n3\n, -CH=CH-O-CH\n3\n, -Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH=N-OCH\n3\n, and - CH=CH-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n3\n. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH\n2\n-NH-OCH\n3\n and -CH\n2\n-O-Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n. Similarly, the term \"heteroalkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\n-S- CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n2\n-. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula -C(O)\n2\nR'- represents both -C(O)\n2\nR\n1\n- and -R\n1\nC(O)\n2\n-.\n\n\n[0081] The terms \"cycloalkyl\" and \"heterocycloalkyl\", by themselves or in combination with other terms, as used herein refer to cyclic versions of \"alkyl\" and \"heteroalkyl\", respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1- piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyI, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran- 2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2- piperazinyl, and the like.\n\n\n[0082] The term \"aryl\" as used herein refers to a polyunsaturated, aromatic moiety that can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings), which are fused together or linked covalently. The term \"heteroaryl\" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, S, and Se, wherein the nitrogen, sulfur, and selenium atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4- oxazolyl, 2-pheπyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2- \n\n thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3- pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, tetrazolyl, benzo[b]furanyl, benzo[b]thienyl, 2,3-dihydrobenzo[1 ,4]dioxin-6-yl, benzo[1 ,3]dioxol-5-yl and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.\n\n\n[0083] For brevity, the term \"aryl\" when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term \"arylalkyl\" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2- pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).\n\n\n[0084] Each of the above terms (e.g., \"alkyl,\" \"heteroalkyl,\" \"aryl\" and \"heteroaryl\") includes both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.\n\n\n[0085] Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) are generically referred to as \"alkyl group substituents,\" and they can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: -OR\n1\n, =0, =NR', =N-OR', -NR\n1\nR\", -SR\n1\n, - halogen, -SiR\n1\nR\n11\nR\n1\n\", -OC(O)R\n1\n, -C(O)R\n1\n, -CO\n2\nR\n1\n, -CONR\n1\nR\", -OC(O)NR\n1\nR\", - NR\n11\nC(O)R\n1\n, -NR^C(O)NR\n11\nR\"\n1\n, -NR\n11\nC(O) \n2\nR\n1\n, -NR-C(NR\n1\nR\n11\nR\n111\nJ=NR\"\", -NR- C(NR\n1\nR\n11\nJ=NR\n1\n\", -S(O)R', -S(O)\n2\nR\n1\n, -S(O)\n2\nNR\n1\nR\", -NRSO\n2\nR\n1\n, -CN and -NO\n2\n in a number ranging from zero to (2rτT+ 1), where m\n1\n is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R\n1\n, R\", R\"\n1\n and R\"\" each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\n1\n, R\", R\"\n1\n and R\"\n1\n' groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R\" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR\n1\nR\" is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \"alkyl\" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, \n\n such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF\n3\n and -CH\n2\nCF\n3\n) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH\n3\n, -C(O)CF\n3\n, - C(O)CH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, and the like).\n\n\n[0086] Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as \"aryl group substituents.\" The substituents are selected from, for example: halogen, -OR', =0, =NR', =N-OR', - NR\n1\nR\", -SR', -halogen, -SiR\n1\nR\n11\nR\n1\n\", -OC(O)R\n1\n, -C(O)R', -CO2R\n1\n, -CONR\n1\nR\", - OC(O)NR\n1\nR\", -NR\n11\nC(O)R\n1\n, -NR^C(O)NR\n11\nR\n1\n\", -NR\n11\nC(O)\n2\nR\n1\n, -NR-C(NR\n1\nR\n11\nR\n111\nJ=NR\"\", - NR-C(NR\n1\nR\n1\nO=NR\n1\n\", -S(O)R\n1\n, -S(O)\n2\nR', -S(O)\n2\nNR\n1\nR\", -NRSO\n2\nR\n1\n, -CN and -NO\n2\n, -R\n1\n, - N\n3\n, -CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\nr\nC\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\nr\nC\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R\n1\n, R\", R\n1\n\" and R\"\" are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\n1\n, R\", R\n1\n\" and R\"\" groups when more than one of these groups is present. In the schemes that follow, the symbol X represents \n11\nR\" as described above.\n\n\n[0087] Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein T and LJ are independently -NR-, -0-, -CRR'- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from O to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A- (CH\n2\nJr-B-, wherein A and B are independently -CRR\n1\n-, -O-, -NR-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)\n2\n-, -S(O)\n2\nNR\n1\n- or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -(CRR\n1\nJs-X-(CR\n11\nR\n111\nJd-, where s and d are independently integers of from O to 3, and X is -0-, -NR\n1\n-, -S-, - S(O)-, -S(O)\n2\n-, or -S(O)\n2\nNR'-. The substituents R, R', R\" and R\n1\n\" are preferably independently selected from hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C6)alkyl.\n\n\n[0088] As used herein, the term \"heteroatom\" includes oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), and selenium (Se).\n\n\n[0089] The term \"amino\" or \"amine group\" as used herein refers to the group - NR\n1\nR\" (or N\n+\nRR\n1\nR\") where R, R\n1\n and R\" are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aryl alkyl, substituted aryl alkyl, heteroaryl, and substituted heteroaryl. A substituted amine being an amine group wherein R\n1\n or R\" is other than hydrogen. In a primary amino \n\n group, both R' and R\" are hydrogen, whereas in a secondary amino group, either, but not both, R' or R\" is hydrogen. In addition, the terms \"amine\" and \"amino\" can include protonated and quaternized versions of nitrogen, comprising the group - N\n+\nRR\n1\nR\" and its biologically compatible anionic counterions.\n\n\n[0090] The term \"aqueous solution\" as used herein refers to a solution that is predominantly water and retains the solution characteristics of water. Where the aqueous solution contains solvents in addition to water, water is typically the predominant solvent.\n\n\n[0091] The term \"carboxyalkyl\" as used herein refers to a group having the general formula -(CH2)nCOOH wherein n is 1-18.\n\n\n[0092] The term \"activated alkyne,\" as used herein refers to a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an alkyne reactive group, such as an azido moiety or an phosphine moiety, on another molecule to form a covalent chemical bond between the activated alkyne group and the alkyne reactive group. Examples of alkyne- reactive groups include azides. \"Alkyne-reactive\" can also refer to a molecule that contains a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an alkyne group. As used herein activated alkyne encompasses any terminal alkynes or cyclooctynes (dipolarophiles) that will react with 1 ,3-dipoles such as azides in a facile fashion.\n\n\n[0093] The term \"aqueous solution,\" as used herein refers to a solution that is predominantly water and retains the solution characteristics of water. Where the aqueous solution contains solvents in addition to water, water is typically the predominant solvent.\n\n\n[0094] The term \"azide reactive,\" as used herein refers to a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an azido modified group on another molecule to form a covalent chemical bond between the azido modified group and the azide reactive group. Examples of azide-reactive groups include alkynes and phosphines (e.g. triaryl phosphine). \"Azide-reactive\" can also refer to a molecule that contains a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an azido group.\n\n\n[0095] The term \"click chemistry,\" as used herein refers to the Huisgen cycloaddition or the 2,3-dipolar cycloaddition between an azide and a terminal alkyne to form a 1 ,2,4-triazole. Such chemical reactions can use, but are not limited to, simple heteroatomic organic reactants and are reliable, selective, stereospecific, and exothermic.\n\n\n[0096] The term \"cycloaddition\" as used herein refers to a chemical reaction in which two or more π-electron systems (e.g., unsaturated molecules or unsaturated parts of the same molecule) combine to form a cyclic product in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity. In a cycloaddition, the .pi. electrons are used to \n\n form new sigma bonds. The product of a cycloaddition is called an \"adduct\" or \"cycloadduct\". Different types of cycloadditions are known in the art including, but not limited to, [3+2] cycloadditions and Diels-Alder reactions. [3+2] cycloadditions, which are also called 2,3-dipolar cycloadditions, occur between a 1 ,3-dipole and a dipolarophile and are typically used for the construction of five-membered heterocyclic rings.\n\n\n[0097] The term \"isolated\", when used herein in reference to a nucleic acid polymer, and as used herein refers to a nucleic acid polymer, which by virtue of its origin or manipulation is separated from at least some of the components with which it is naturally associated or with which it is associated when initially obtained. By \"isolated\", it is alternatively or additionally meant that the nucleic acid polymer of interest is produced or synthesized by the hand of man.\n\n\n[0098] The term \"linker\" or \"tether\" as used herein refers to a single covalent bond or a series of stable covalent bonds incorporating 1-30 nonhydrogen atoms selected from the group consisting of C, N, O, S and P. In addition, the linker may covalently attaches a carrier molecule or solid support or a boronic acid moiety to the present azido or activated alkyne modified nucleotides or nucleic acid polymers. Exemplary linking members include a moiety that includes -C(O)NH-, -C(O)O-, -NH-, -S-, -O-, and the like.\n\n\n[0099] The term \"reactive group\" as used herein refers to a group that is capable of reacting with another chemical group to form a covalent bond, i.e. is covalently reactive under suitable reaction conditions, and generally represents a point of attachment for another substance. As used herein, reactive groups refer to chemical moieties generally found in biological systems and that react under normal biological conditions, these are herein distinguished from the chemical handle, defined above, the azido and activated alkyne moieties of the present invention. As referred to herein the reactive group is a moiety, such as carboxylic acid or succinimidyl ester, that is capable of chemically reacting with a functional group on a different compound to form a covalent linkage. Reactive groups generally include nucleophiles, electrophiles and photoactivatable groups.\n\n\n[00100] The term \"reporter molecule\" as used herein refers to any moiety capable of being attached to a carrier molecule or solid support, such as a modified nucleotide or nucleic acid polymer, and detected either directly or indirectly. Reporter molecules include, without limitation, a chromophore, a fluorophore, a fluorescent protein, a phosphorescent dye, a tandem dye, a particle, a hapten, an enzyme and a radioisotope. Preferred reporter molecules include fluorophores, fluorescent proteins, haptens, and enzymes. \n\n [00101] The term \"sample\" as used herein refers to any material that may contain an analyte for detection or quantification or a modified nucleotide or nucleic acid polymer. The analyte may include a reactive group, e.g., a group through which a compound of the invention can be conjugated to the analyte. The sample may also include diluents, buffers, detergents, and contaminating species, debris and the like that are found mixed with the target. Illustrative examples include urine, sera, blood plasma, total blood, saliva, tear fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, secretory fluids from nipples and the like. Also included are solid, gel or sol substances such as mucus, body tissues, cells and the like suspended or dissolved in liquid materials such as buffers, extractants, solvents and the like. Typically, the sample is a live cell, a biological fluid that comprises endogenous host cell proteins, nucleic acid polymers, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, peptides and buffer solutions. The sample may be in an aqueous solution, a viable cell culture or immobilized on a solid or semi solid surface such as a polyacrylamide gel, membrane blot or on a microarray. [00102] The term \"solid support,\" as used herein refers to a material that is substantially insoluble in a selected solvent system, or which can be readily separated (e.g., by precipitation) from a selected solvent system in which it is soluble. Solid supports useful in practicing the present invention can include groups that are activated or capable of activation to allow selected one or more compounds described herein to be bound to the solid support. [00103] The term \"boronic acid\" as used herein refers to an alkyl or aryl substituted boronic acid containing a boron-carbon chemical bond. Boronic acid groups that may be used in the compositions of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, arylboronic acids such as phenylboronic acids, naphthalenylboronic acids, quinolinylboronic acids, pyridinylboronic acids, furanylboronic acids, thiophenylboronic acids, indolylboronic acids, 1,8- naphthalimide-based boronic acids, and α-amidoalkylboronic acids. In addition, the boronic acid group can include, but is not limited to, fluorescent boronic acid groups as shown in Fig. 24, for example. In particular, the boronic acid group can include phenylboronic acid, naphthalenylboronic acid, quinolin-4-ylboronic acid, quinolin-5- ylboronic acid, quinolin-8-ylboronic acid, pyridinylboronic acid, furan-2-ylboronic acid, and thiophen-2-ylboronic acid.\n\n\n[00104] Many cell surface and secretory proteins produced by eukaryotic cells are modified with one or more oligosaccharide groups. This modification referred to as \"glycosylation,\" can dramatically affect the physical properties of proteins and can also be important in protein stability, secretion, and subcellular localization. Proper glycosylation can be essential for biological activity. In fact, some genes from \n\n eukaryotic organisms, when expressed in bacteria (e.g., E. coli) which lack certain cellular processes for glycosylating proteins, yield proteins that are recovered with little or no activity by virtue of their lack of glycosylation.\n\n\n[00105] Glycosylation occurs at specific locations along the polypeptide backbone and is usually of two types: O-linked oligosaccharides are attached to serine or threonine residues while Λ/-linked oligosaccharides are attached to asparagine residues when they are part of the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid except proline. The structures of Λ/-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and the sugar residues found in each type are different. One type of sugar that is commonly found on both is /V-acetylneuraminic acid (hereafter referred to as sialic acid). Sialic acid is usually the terminal residue of both Λ/-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and, by virtue of its negative charge, may confer acidic properties to the glycoprotein.\n\n\n[00106] The term \"glycosylation site\" as used herein refers to a location on a polypeptide that has a glycan chain attached thereto. The \"site\" may be an amino acid side-chain, or a plurality of side-chains (either contiguous in the amino acid sequence or in cooperative vicinity to one another to define a specific site associated with at least one glycosylation chain). The term \"glycosylation site\" as used herein further refers to a combination of a region of a polypeptide, and a region of a glycan chain attached to the polypeptide. Both regions may be recognized as binding, or affinity, sites by an aptamer having a specific affinity for the glycosylated species of the peptide. In particular, an aptamer having a boronic acid group(s) will have enhanced affinity for the glycosylation chain compared to an aptamer having the same nucleotide sequence but not having a boronic acid group thereon. Both aptamers will have affinity for the region of the polypeptide that is included in the glycosylation site.\n\n\n[00107] The terms \"oligonucleotide\" and \"polynucleotide\" as used herein refers to any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide that may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. Thus, for instance, polynucleotides as used herein refers to, among others, single-and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single-and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. The terms \"nucleic acid,\" \"nucleic acid sequence,\" or \"oligonucleotide\" also encompass a polynucleotide as defined above. Typically, aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides comprising between about 7 to about 100 nucleotides. \n\n [00108] The term \"polynucleotide\" as used herein refers to DNAs or RNAs as described above that may contain one or more modified bases. Thus, DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons are \"polynucleotides\" as that term is intended herein. Moreover, DNAs or RNAs comprising unusual bases, such as inosine, or modified bases such as, but not limited to, thymidine or uracil having a boronic acid group thereon are polynucleotides as the term is used herein.\n\n\n[00109] The terms \"complementarity\" or \"complementary\" as used herein refer to a sufficient number in the oligonucleotide of complementary base pairs in its sequence to interact specifically (hybridize) with the target nucleic acid sequence to be amplified or detected. As known to those skilled in the art, a very high degree of complementarity is needed for specificity and sensitivity involving hybridization, although it need not be 100%. Thus, for example, an oligonucleotide that is identical in nucleotide sequence to an oligonucleotide disclosed herein, except for one base change or substitution, may function equivalently to the disclosed oligonucleotides. A \"complementary DNA\" or \"cDNA\" gene includes recombinant genes synthesized by reverse transcription of messenger RNA (\"mRNA\").\n\n\n[00110] The term \"cyclic polymerase-mediated reaction\" as used herein refers to a biochemical reaction in which a template molecule or a population of template molecules is periodically and repeatedly copied to create a complementary template molecule or complementary template molecules, thereby increasing the number of the template molecules over time.\n\n\n[00111] The term \"polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" as used herein refers to a thermocyclic, polymerase-mediated, DNA amplification reaction. A PCR typically includes template molecules, oligonucleotide primers complementary to each strand of the template molecules, a thermostable DNA polymerase, and deoxyribonucleotides, and involves three distinct processes that are multiply repeated to effect the amplification of the original nucleic acid. The three processes (denaturation, hybridization, and primer extension) are often performed at distinct temperatures, and in distinct temporal steps. In many embodiments, however, the hybridization and primer extension processes can be performed concurrently. The nucleotide sample to be analyzed may be PCR amplification products provided using the rapid cycling techniques described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,569,672; 6,569,627; 6,562,298; 6,556,940; 6,569,672; 6,569,627; 6,562,298; 6,556,940; 6,489,112; 6,482,615; 6,472,156; 6,413,766; 6,387,621 ; 6,300,124; 6,270,723; 6,245,514; 6,232,079; 6,228,634; 6,218,193; 6,210,882; 6,197,520; 6,174,670; 6,132,996; 6,126,899; 6,124,138; 6,074,868; 6,036,923; 5,985,651 ; 5,958,763; 5,942,432; \n\n 5,935,522; 5,897,842; 5,882,918; 5,840,573; 5,795,784; 5,795,547; 5,785,926; 5,783,439; 5,736,106; 5,720,923; 5,720,406; 5,675,700; 5,616,301 ; 5,576,218 and 5,455,175, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. Other methods of amplification include, without limitation, NASBR, SDA, 3SR, TSA and rolling circle replication. It is understood that, in any method for producing a polynucleotide containing given modified nucleotides, one or several polymerases or amplification methods may be used. The selection of optimal polymerization conditions depends on the application.\n\n\n[00112] The terms \"percent sequence identity\" or \"percent sequence similarity\" as used herein refer to the degree of sequence identity between two nucleic acid sequences or two amino acid sequences as determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Attschul (1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 87: 2264-2268), modified as in Karlin and Attschul (1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90: 5873-5877). The oligonucleotides of predetermined variability share at least 90% sequence identity with the internal sequence of a parent polynucleotide sequence, for example at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Attschul et al. (1990, T. MoI. Biol. Q15: 403-410). BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, word length = 12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule of the invention. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, word length = 3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a reference polypeptide. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST is utilized as described in Attschul et al. (1997, Nuc. Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) may be used. [00113] A \"polymerase\" is an enzyme that catalyzes the sequential addition of monomeric units to a polymeric chain, or links two or more monomeric units to initiate a polymeric chain. In advantageous embodiments of this invention, the \"polymerase\" will work by adding monomeric units whose identity is determined by and which is complementary to a template molecule of a specific sequence. For example, DNA polymerases such as DNA pol 1 and Taq polymerase add deoxyribonucleotides to the 3' end of a polynucleotide chain in a template-dependent manner, thereby synthesizing a nucleic acid that is complementary to the template molecule. Polymerases may be used either to extend a primer once or repetitively or to amplify a polynucleotide by repetitive priming of two complementary strands using two primers. \n\n [00114] The terms \"enzymatically amplify\" or \"amplify\" as used herein refer to DNA amplification, i.e., a process by which nucleic acid sequences are amplified in number. There are several means for enzymatically amplifying nucleic acid sequences. Currently the most commonly used method is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Other amplification methods include LCR (ligase chain reaction) which utilizes DNA ligase, and a probe consisting of two halves of a DNA segment that is complementary to the sequence of the DNA to be amplified, enzyme QB replicase and a ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence template attached to a probe complementary to the DNA to be copied which is used to make a DNA template for exponential production of complementary RNA; strand displacement amplification (SDA); Qβ replicase amplification (QβRA); self-sustained replication (3SR); and NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification), which can be performed on RNA or DNA as the nucleic acid sequence to be amplified. [00115] The term \"denaturation\" of a template molecule as used herein refers to the unfolding or other alteration of the structure of a template so as to make the template accessible to duplication. In the case of DNA, \"denaturation\" refers to the separation of the two complementary strands of the double helix, thereby creating two complementary, single stranded template molecules. \"Denaturation\" can be accomplished in any of a variety of ways, including by heat or by treatment of the DNA with a base or other denaturant.\n\n\n[00116] It will be appreciated that a great variety of modifications have been made to DNA and RNA that serve many useful purposes known to those skilled in the art. The term polynucleotide as it is employed herein embraces such chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells, including simple and complex cells, inter alia.\n\n\n[00117] By way of example, a polynucleotide sequence of the present disclosure may be identical to the reference sequence, that is be 100% identical, or it may include up to a certain integer number of nucleotide alterations as compared to the reference sequence. Such alterations are selected from the group including at least one nucleotide deletion, substitution, including transition and transversion, or insertion, and wherein said alterations may occur at the 5' or 3' terminus positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminus positions, interspersed either individually among the nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The number of nucleotide alterations is determined by multiplying the total number of nucleotides in the reference nucleotide by the numerical percent of the respective percent identity \n\n (divided by 100) and subtracting that product from said total number of nucleotides in the reference nucleotide.\n\n\n[00118] The terms \"nucleotide\", \"nucleotide monomer\" and a \"nucleotide moiety\" refer to a sub-unit of a nucleic acid (whether DNA or RNA, or an analogue thereof) which includes, but is not limited to, a phosphate ester group, a sugar group and a nitrogen-containing base (alternatively referred to as a nucleoside), as well as analogs of such sub-units. Other groups (e.g., protecting groups) can be attached to the sugar group and nitrogen containing base group including, but not limited to, a boronic acid group according to the present disclosure, a radioactive or fluorescent substituent, a dye and the like.\n\n\n[00119] The term \"nucleoside\" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid subunit including a sugar group and a nitrogen containing base. It should be noted that the term \"nucleotide\" is used herein to describe embodiments of the disclosure, but that one skilled in the art would understand that the term \"nucleoside\" and \"nucleotide\" are interchangeable in many instances. One skilled in the art would have the understanding that additional modifications to a nucleoside may be necessary, and one skilled in the art has such knowledge.\n\n\n[00120] The term \"nucleotide monomer\" as used herein refers to a molecule which is not incorporated in a larger oligo- or poly-nucleotide chain and which corresponds to a single nucleotide sub-unit; nucleotide monomers may also have activating or protecting groups, if such groups are necessary for the intended use of the nucleotide monomer.\n\n\n[00121] It will be appreciated that, as used herein, the terms \"nucleotide\" and \"nucleoside\" will include those moieties which contain not only the naturally occurring purine and pyrimidine bases, e.g., adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or uracil (U), but also modified purine and pyrimidine bases and other heterocyclic bases which have been modified (these moieties are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as \"purine and pyrimidine bases and analogs thereof). Such modifications include, e.g., diaminopurine and its derivatives, inosine and its derivatives, alkylated purines or pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines thiolated purines or pyrimidines, selenium-modified nucleosidic bases, and the like, or the addition of a protecting group such as acetyl, difluoroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, isobutyryl, benzoyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, phenoxyacetyl, dimethylformamidine, N\n1\nN- diphenyl carbamate, or the like. The purine or pyrimidine base may also be an analog of the foregoing; suitable analogs will be known to those skilled in the art and are described in the pertinent texts and literature. \n\n [00122] Common analogs include, but are not limited to, 1-methyladenine; 2- methyladenine; N6-methyladenine; N6-isopentyladenine; 2-methylthio-N6- isopentyladenine; N,N-dimethyladenine; 8-bromoadenine; 2-thiocytosine; 3- methylcytosine; 5-methylcytosine; 5-ethylcytosine; 4-acetylcytosine; 1- methylguanine; 2-methylguanine; 7-methylguanine; 2,2-dimethylguanine; 8- bromoguanine; 8-chloroguanine; 8-aminoguanine; 8-methylguanine; 8-thioguanine; 5-fluorouracil; 5-bromouracil; 5-chlorouracil; 5-iodouracil; 5-ethy I uracil; 5-propyluracil; 5-methoxyuracil; 5-hydroxymethyluracil; 5-(carboxyhydroxymethyl)uracil; 5- (methylaminomethyl)uracil; 5-(carboxymethyIaminomethyl)-uracil; 2-thiouracil; 5- methyl-2-thiouraciI; 5-(2-bromovinyl)uracil; uracil-5-oxyacetic acid; uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methyl ester; pseudouracil; 1-methylpseudouracil; queosine; inosine; 1- methylinosine; hypoxanthine; xanthine; 2-aminopurine; 6-hydroxyaminopurine; 6- thiopurine, and 2,6-diaminopurine.\n\n\n[00123] The term \"randomized oligonucleotide aptamer\" as used herein refers to a population of oligonucleotides wherein, at the same nucleotide position in each sequence, the nucleotide is adenine, guanine, cytosine or thymine. [00124] The term \"hybridization\" as used herein refers to the process of association of two nucleic acid strands to form an antiparallel duplex stabilized by means of hydrogen bonding between residues of the opposite nucleic acid strands. [00125] The terms \"hybridizing\" and \"binding\", with respect to polynucleotides, as used herein are used interchangeably. The terms \"hybridizing specifically to\" and \"specific hybridization\" and \"selectively hybridize to,\" as used herein refer to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a nucleic acid molecule preferentially to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent conditions.\n\n\n[00126] The term \"selectively binds(ing)\" as used herein refers to when a ligand or other molecule has a higher affinity for a first target molecule or structure compared to the binding affinity with a second molecule or structure. [00127] The term \"target\" as used herein refers to a glycopolypeptide or glycoprotein, for which it is desired to detect or analyze the glycosylation status thereof. The target glycopolypeptide or protein for use in the methods herein disclosed may be an isolated glycopolypeptide or glycoprotein, a glycopolypeptide or protein immobilized on a solid support or in free solution. Alternatively, the target glycopolypeptide or protein may be on a cell surface, the cell being isolated from a plant or animal host, a cultured cell or a cell or population of cells in a tissue of a plant or animal.\n\n\n[00128] It should be noted that ratios, concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be expressed herein in a range format. It is to be understood \n\n that such a range format is used for convenience and brevity, and thus, should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. To illustrate, a concentration range of \"about 0.1% to 5%\" should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited concentration of about 0.1 wt% to about 5 wt%, but also include individual concentrations (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., 0.5%, 1.1%, 2.2%, 3.3%, and 4.4%) within the indicated range. The term \"about\" can include ±1 %, ±2%, ±3%, ±4%, ±5%, ±6%, ±7%, ±8%, ±9%, or ±10%, or more of the numerical value(s) being modified. In addition, the phrase \"about 'x' to 'y'\" includes \"about 'x' to about 'y\"\\ Discussion\n\n\n[00129] The embodiments of the present disclosure encompass nucleotide monomers, oligonucleotides, and aptamers incorporating nucleotides modified as disclosed herein. The present disclosure further encompasses methods of preparation of each, methods of preparing specific types of aptamers, methods of preparing and identifying and selecting aptamers that have specific affinity for a glycoprotein (although the compositions and methods of the disclosure may also be applied to other target glycosylated biomolecular species such as, but not limited to, glycolipids, carbohydrates, and other glycoproducts), methods of preparing and identifying aptamers that have specific affinity for glycosylation sites and glycosylation states of target polypeptides, methods of biasing the identification of aptamers toward carbohydrate recognition, and the like. [00130] The nucleotide monomers encompassed by the present disclosure include a boronic acid group or moiety. Oligonucleotides and aptamers of the present disclosure may include one or more nucleotide monomers, where the nucleotide monomer includes a boronic acid group. Incorporation of a boronic acid moiety into one or more nucleotides of a polynucleotide (e.g., a DNA, DNA aptamers, an RNA, RNA aptamers, oligonucleotides, and the like) allow the oligonucleotide to recognize and bind to glycan chains, glycosylation sites and/or changes in the glycosylation status of a target biomolecule (e.g., carbohydrates, glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and glycolipids) by virtue of the strong binding between boronic acid and the glycans of the target biomolecule. In particular, the aptamers encompassed by the present disclosure are able not only to selectively recognize a glycoprotein, but also to distinguish differences in the glycosylation status of the glycoprotein. [00131 ] There are several general approaches possible for conjugating a boronic acid moiety to a nucleotides monomer. \"Click\" chemistry, which uses chemistry \n\n orthogonal to all the other functional groups present, is one such approach. For example, the Huisgen cycloaddition may be used, which requires the presence of an azido group on one side and a terminal alkyne on the other (see, for example, Fig. 2). As a specific embodiment, the azido group was put on the boronic acid side and the alkynyl group on the modified thymidine (or its triphosphate) (see, for example, Fig. 3, compound 10). In another embodiment, the azido group is placed on the modified thymidine and the alkynyl group is placed on the boronic acid side. [00132] The present disclosure provides methods for the preparation of aptamers that can recognize and/or be used to detect biomolecules having glycosylation sites, and/or recognize and/or detect changes in the glycosylation status of a biomolecule. In one embodiment of the disclosure, fibrinogen (a glycoprotein) was the target polypeptide and used to develop aptamers that can detect glycosylated fibrinogen at low concentrations (e.g., at nM concentrations). In another embodiment of the present disclosure, prostate specific antigen (PSA), a prostate cancer marker, was used to develop aptamers that can recognize glycosylation differences in prostate specific antigen. Additional details are provided in the specific examples below. [00133] Embodiments of the present disclosure further encompass aptamers incorporating boronic acid groups, including boronic acids having fluorescent properties that may change upon binding. The latter embodiments of the present disclosure provide for aptamers and methods of detecting when the aptamer interacts with a biomolecule having a sugar group or multiple hydroxyl groups. [00134] The nucleotide monomers of the present disclosure may each include a boronic acid group bonded (directly, or indirectly via a linking group) to the nucleosidic base (base) of the nucleotide monomer. The modified or labeled nucleotide monomers according to the present disclosure have an affinity for a glycan chain of a biomolecule due to the boronic acid affinity for the diol and/or hydroxyl group(s) of the oligosaccharide chain. The nucleotide monomers of the disclosure can include, but are not limited to, monomers such as those shown in Figs. 1A, 1 B, 21 , and 31. One embodiment of the boronic acid labeled nucleotide monomer according to the present disclosure is shown in Fig. 1 B as structure B-TTP (12).\n\n\n[00135] The boronic acid group that may be conjugated to a nucleosidic base according to the present disclosure may be, but is not limited to, arylboronic acids such as phenylboronic acids, naphthalenylboronic acids, quinolinylboronic acids, pyridinylboronic acids, furanylboronic acids, thiophenylboronic acids, indolylboronic acids, 1 ,8-naphthalimide-based boronic acids, and α-amidoalkylboronic acids. In addition, the boronic acid group can be a fluorescent boronic acid group such as, but \n\n not limited to those structures illustrated in Fig. 24. In particular, the boronic acid group can include phenylboronic acid, naphthalenylboronic acid, quinolin-4-ylboronic acid, quinolin-5-ylboronic acid, quinolin-8-ylboronic acid, pyridinylboronic acid, furan- 2-ylboronic acid, and thiophen-2-ylboronic acid.\n\n\n[00136] The boronic acid attached to a nucleotide according to the present disclosure may be linked to the nucleosidic base (base) thereof by a linking group, or tether, selected from the group of, but not limited to, an alkyl group, an alkylene group, an aryl or heteroaryl group, a cycloalkyl group, an alkoxy group, an aryloxy or heteroaryloxy group, an arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl group, an arylalkyloxyl or heteroarylalkyloxyl group, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n[00137] Referring now to the generalized nucleotide structure as illustrated in Fig. 1A, each of Ri and R\n2\n may be, but is not limited to, a phosphate ester group (e.g., mono-, di-, or tri-phosphate ester group), thiophosphate (phosphorothioate), boranophosphate, and boranothophorothioate. Only one of Ri and R\n2\n can be a phosphate group. R\n3\n can be, but is not limited to, H, and OH. In one embodiment, one or more of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3\n can be a protecting group or other group used to enhance the preparation of the oligonucleotide. Advantageously, R\n2\n and R\n3\n are HO- and H-, respectively.\n\n\n[00138] The base R\n5\n can be a naturally occurring purine or pyrimidine base, e.g., adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G), hypoxanthine, or uracil (U), but also modified purine and pyrimidine bases and other heterocyclic bases which have been modified (these moieties are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as \"purine and pyrimidine bases and analogs thereof). In one particular embodiment of the disclosure, the base is thymine (see Examples 1 and 2). [00139] The modified nucleotides according to the present disclosure may be incorporated into oligonucleotides to generate libraries of randomized sequences. It is necessary, therefore, to select from such heterogeneous libraries the oligonucleotides or aptamers with the desired specific affinities for a target glycosylated polypeptide or protein. Accordingly, the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) approach for aptamer selection (Science 1990, 249: 505; J. MoI. Biol. 1991, 222: 739, U.S. Patent 5,270,163, each of which are incorporated herein by reference) was used, as shown schematically in Fig. 20, to identify desired aptamers from a pool or library of oligonucleotides, the desired aptamers having biased affinity for glycan, and most preferably for distinct glycosylation sites of a target polypeptide or protein. The aptamers manufactured and selected according to the disclosure, therefore, have selective affinity to a region of the target glycopolypeptide, thereby conferring on the aptamer specificity for the \n\n glycopolypeptide itself, and to a region of the glycan attached to the polypeptide. By being selected for the dual affinities, the isolated aptamer(s) will specifically recognize a glycosylated form of the target glycopolypeptide, and not just the polypeptide itself, or a glycan chain alone. In general, the SELEX method includes contacting a mixture of oligonucleotides, each oligonucleotide preferably including a segment of randomized sequence, with the target polypeptide (e.g., but not limited to, PSA or fibrinogen) under conditions favorable for binding, partitioning unbound oligonucleotides from those oligonucleotides which have bound to target molecules, dissociating the oligonucleotide-target pairs. The oligonucleotides dissociated from the oligonucleotides-target pairs may be amplified to yield a ligand-enriched mixture of oligonucleotides, then repeating the steps of binding, partitioning, dissociating and amplifying through as many cycles as desired {e.g., 2 to 20, 4 to 20, or 13 to 14). [00140] In a counter-selection step, the aptamers are amplified using dTTP so that the amplified products do not include a boronic acid label. These unlabeled aptamers are then counter-selected using glycosylated target polypeptide or protein, such as fibrinogen. Consequently, the unbound aptamers from this third counter- selection step are those that have biased affinity for the glycan of the target polypeptide or protein only when they include a boronic acid label. Counter- selection, using a deglycosylated target polypeptide will eliminate those aptamers selectively binding to sites on the polypeptide alone. Counter-selection, using micro- beads alone will partition out those aptamers binding to the beads themselves. [00141] The selection process of the present disclosure is not limited in the nature of the target polypeptide or protein. It is contemplated that the selection methods herein disclosed may also be applied to glycoprotein targets including, but not limited to, prostate specific antigen (PSA), mucin, human carcinoembryonic antigen, human pancreatic RNase 1 , tumor-associated glycoproteins (TAG-72), CA 125, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), alpha- fetoprotein (AFP), haptoglobin (Hp), antibodies, hormones, and human glycoproteins 96 (a tumor-rejection protein) and the like.\n\n\n[00142] The aptamer selection process gravitates toward strong sugar (glycosylation portion) recognition in glycoproteins. As described herein, boronic acids are known to interact strongly with diol-containing compounds and simple Lewis bases and nucleophiles such as a hydroxyl group. These are commonly found on carbohydrates. Such interactions can be used for carbohydrate recognition. While not wishing to be limited to any one theory, the incorporation of a boronic acid moiety into an oligonucleotide aptamer, on account of the significant affinity of the boronic acid for saccharides, and in particular diol and hydroxyl groups thereof, \n\n enables the selection process to isolate those aptamers binding to a carbohydrate sub-structure. This therefore allows for recognition of the glycoprotein and the ability to recognize differences in glycosylation states of the polypeptide. [00143] Example 1 below describes the chemistry, and the methods thereof, whereby a boronic acid moiety was linked to the 5'-position of thymidine-5'- triphosphate resulting in B-TTP (12), as shown in Fig. 1B. Modification at this position is known to have minimal effect on polymerase-catalyzed incorporation. The 5-position boronic acid-labeled thymidine-5'-triphosphate (B-TTP) can be successfully incorporated into DNA using DNA polymerases and the synthesized boronic acid-modified DNA (B-DNA) can serve as templates for further amplification, as described in Example 6.\n\n\n[00144] In the SELEX selection process as described in Example 10 below, fibrinogen was immobilized to magnetic beads using amidation chemistry. It is contemplated, however, that the target polypeptide or protein may be bound to any suitable solid support that will allow separation of the target and bound aptamer from the remaining unbound aptamer pool. Alternatively, the target polypeptide or protein may be conjugated to a group that allows for the separation of bound and unbound aptamer. For example, it is contemplated that the target protein could be conjugated to a biotin group, and the polypeptide could then be isolated from the unbound, nonspecific aptamer using streptavidin bound to magnetic beads. In addition, the target polypeptide could be precipitated with a specific antibody, leaving unbound aptamer in suspension. In the example described in the present disclosure, a library of DNA oligonucleotides each containing 50 randomized positions was first amplified by PCR. The incorporation of boronic acid-modified nucleotide (B-TTP) was performed in the last round of polymerase reaction using a single primer. Accordingly, there was minimal exposure of the boronic acid moiety to the high temperature cycles necessary for PCR, even though the boronic acid moiety is stable under PCR conditions. Finally, the boronic acid labeled single stranded DNA library was exposed to fibrinogen-immobilized beads. Aptamers bound to immobilized fibrinogen were recovered and re-amplified.\n\n\n[00145] After selection and counter selection (counter-selection against blank beads and using all natural dNTPs), the fibrinogen-specific enriched DNA library was cloned into E. coli using the TOPO TA CLONING™ Kit for sequencing (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Colonies were randomly selected for sequence analysis, and several of the aptamers were selected for further analysis. The selection could be based, at least in part, upon the appearance of the sequences in both pre-counter-selection and post-counter-selection pools. \n\n [00146] Dissociation constants of the aptamers, which can be determined using equilibrium filtration, provided the degree to which the aptamers bind specifically to fibrinogen. The dissociation constants obtained for the aptamers could then be compared to one or more controls to determine the strength of the association. For example, the aptamers may have a K\nά\n at the nanomolar level (e.g., about 6 nanomolar).\n\n\nSynthesis and Properties of Boronic Acid Labeled Aptamers [00147] A boronic acid moiety can be covalently linked to a nucleoside triphosphate that is then used in DNA polymerization and amplification reactions. The 5'-position modification of deoxyuridine can be tolerated by polymerases and reverse transcriptases, although whether the attachment of a boronic acid moiety interfered with these reactions was not apparent. The strong Lewis acidity of the boronic acid moiety can lead to tight interactions with Lewis bases commonly found on nucleic acids and enzymes. These interactions are, therefore, distinguishable from the attachments of other organic functional groups at the 5'-position of deoxyuridine, by possibly including impeded incorporation and amplification, added secondary structures in the DNA products, enzyme binding and inhibition, and even inter-strand interactions.\n\n\n[00148] For minimal interference of the polymerase reaction, a long and somewhat linear linker or tether was used. The Huisgen cycloaddition, which has been extensively used in \"click chemistry\" (performed with and without microwave irradiation) was selected for the coupling of the boronic acid moiety with the nucleoside, although it is contemplated that other suitable schemes may also be used as appropriate for the particular boronic acid or nucleosidic base selected. B- TTP (compound (12), as shown in Fig. 1 B), was designed as an exemplary monomeric building block for DNA polymerization. An 8-quinoline boronic acid analog was selected because of its affinity for various sugars, and its water solubility. Successful incorporation of this large arylboronic acid into an oligonucleotide indicated that other smaller arylboronic acid analogs would possibly have minimal difficulty being incorporated. A quinoline boronic acid analog with an azido group and a 5-modified deoxyuridine analog with an alkyne group were also desirable. The synthesis of the quinoline boronic acid followed the procedures described in Example 1 below, and is schematically illustrated as Scheme 1 in Fig. 2. [00149] Therefore, the synthesis of the quinoline boronic acid building block according to the methods of the present disclosure and described in detail in Example 1 below, started with commercial available 2-bromoaniline (1) (for the chemical structures, refer to Fig. 2), which was converted to 2-methylquinoline (2) by \n\n refluxing with crotonaldehyde in 6N HCI. Bromination at methyl group gives compound (3), which was reacted with 40% methylamine aqueous solution in THF to yield (4). The amino group was first protected with Boc before borylation under the catalysis of dichloro-(bis-diphenylphospino)ferrocenyl)-palladium [Pd(dppf)CI\n2\n] to give compound (6). Deprotection by TFA followed by amide formation with azido acetic acid generated the quinoline boronic acid (7), as shown in Fig. 2. [00150] For the synthesis of the final B-TTP (compound (12)), shown as Scheme 2 illustrated in Fig. 3, there are two possible general approaches. The first one is to attach the boronic acid before ^phosphorylation. The second one is to triphosphorylate before the attachment of the boronic acid moiety. In both approaches, the synthesis starts with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (8). An alkyne side chain may then be attached to the 5-position. Deprotection of the amino group and introduction of a terminal alkyne group results in the intermediate (10). [00151] The boronic acid was attached to nucleoside (10) after preparing the triphosphate (11). The subsequent Huisgen cycloaddition allowed for the tethering the quinoline boronic acid moiety to give (12). The final product was purified by a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 followed by reversed-phase C18 HPLC. Thermal stability studies using NMR under PCR conditions demonstrated that the boronic acid moiety did not present additional stability problems.\n\n\n[00152] Since a goal of the synthetic chemistry was the synthesis of a boronic acid-labeled nucleotide that could be incorporated into DNA, a primer extension reaction using B-TTP (12) was conducted using oligonucleotide Template 21-nt (SEQ ID NO.: 8) and Primer 14-nt (SEQ ID NO.: 9), as described in Example 5. More detailed examination of the ability of B-TTP to be incorporated was conducted through the extension of a Primer 1 (SEQ ID NO.: 2) on the oligonucleotide Template 1 (SEQ ID NO.: 4). This longer template had three adjacent A's in the sequence allowing for the incorporation of three T's, or labeled T's bearing a boronic acid group. The time-dependent incorporation of B-TTP compared with natural TTP using a \n32\nP-labeled primer was also studied. Gel electrophoresis results showed that the full-length DNA was obtained from primer extension reactions, as described in Example 3 and shown in Fig. 5, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. [00153] To allow for quick confirmation of boronic acid incorporation into DNA using electrophoresis, a gel-shift method was also developed by using a low percentage of acrylamide (1 %) modified with catechol, which was synthesized as shown in Scheme 3, Fig. 7 and described in Example 4. Because catechol is known to form a tight complex with a boronic acid moiety, such gels were expected to exert extra retention power for boronic acid-containing DNA and, therefore, allow their \n\n separation from natural DNA of the same length and composition. Fig. 8 illustrates the successful application of such a catechol-embedded acrylamide gel and its ability to differentiate the boronic acid-labeled DNA from that of the natural one. Specifically, when analyzed on the catechol-modified acrylamide gel, only the natural and non-boronic acid modified DNA (using M-TTP (11)) showed the same retention. The DNA labeled with boronic acid through the incorporation of B-TTP (12) moved more slowly compared with the other two, as expected based on the known interaction between boronic acid and catechol. This was confirmed by co-loading these two different samples on the same lane (Fig 8, tracks 2 and 4). [00154] Boronic acid-labeled DNA can serve as a template for further polymerization and amplification. To demonstrate the recognition of boronic acid- labeled full-length DNA as templates by the Klenow fragment, two 20-nucleotide primers (Primers 2 and 3, SEQ ID NOs.: 3 and 5 respectively) were synthesized and analyzed in Fig. 9. The polymerase reactions using the boronic acid-labeled DNA as the template and with M-TTP (11), TTP, or B-TTP (12) and the other three dNTPs as the monomers, were carried out first with Primer 2 (SEQ ID NO.: 3), which is complementary to the 3'-terminus of the oligonucleotide Template 1 (SEQ ID NO.: 4). [00155] After primer extension, the full-length DNA obtained was purified by membrane filtration to remove the labeled and non-labeled dNTPs. Then further polymerization was conducted using natural dNTPs and 5'-\n32\nP-Iabeled Primer 3 (SEQ ID NO.: 5). Gel electrophoresis of the DNA products showed no noticeable differences between using natural and labeled full-length DNA as templates, as shown in Fig. 9, indicating that all full-length DNA templates generated using M-TTP, TTP and B-TTP in the first primer extension were efficiently recognized with a similar efficiency by the polymerase.\n\n\n[00156] To confirm the general feasibility of incorporating the boronic acid labeled TTP (B-TTP) into DNA, similar studies using a different template were carried out (Primers 3 (SEQ ID NO.: 5), Primer 6 (SEQ ID NO.: 4) with Template 2 (SEQ ID NO.: 7). The results again demonstrated the synthesis of the full-length DNA using B- TTP. Furthermore, using an agarose gel run with an extended time run, the boronic acid-labeled DNA was differentiated from the non-labeled DNA, which is consistent with the increased molecular weight of the boronic acid-labeled DNA, as shown in Fig. 10. Boronic acid also has a pKa of about 9 and is mostly charge-neutral under the electrophoresis conditions (buffer pH 8.3). \n\n Carbohydrate substructure-specific DNA aptamer selection [00157] Carbohydrate substructure-specific DNA aptamer selection according to the present disclosure allows the recognition of a glycoprotein and differences in its glycosylation state. It is also contemplated that the methods and compositions of the present disclosure are applicable in the selection of RNA aptamers and for the recognition of other glycosylated products such as glycolipids. [00158] The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) approach for aptamer selection {Science 1990, 249, 505; J. MoI. Biol. 1991 , 222, 739) was used. The SELEX approach to aptamer selection according to the present disclosure is shown in Fig. 20. It involves the synthesis of a DNA oligonucleotide library where the oligonucleotides have invariant sequences at each end. The sequence of the middle portion of each oligonucleotide is randomized to create the combinatorial library. The theoretical number of 40-mer combinations is about 1.2 * 10\n24\n, although in the Examples of the present disclosure a library of about 10\n14\n unique sequences was used.\n\n\n[00159] The library, after PCR amplification, can be exposed to target polypeptides or proteins immobilized on beads. Those oligonucleotides that have affinity for the target ligand will remain bound to the bead and get enriched. Non- binding oligonucleotides are partitioned and washed away with buffer. Release of the bound DNAs using strong eluting conditions will separate the beads from the aptamers, which can be PCR amplified. This process constitutes one round of selection. Repetition of this procedure allows for the enrichment of aptamers that have high affinities for the target ligand. When necessary, counter selection can be used to eliminate unwanted cross-reactivity. In a counter selection step, the counter selection ligand can be immobilized to the beads so as to remove those aptamers with cross-reactivity with the counter selection ligand. The result of the selection procedures of the present disclosure are aptamers biased to an affinity for a glycan chain of a specific target polypeptide. In this approach, K\nά\n values for aptamer-target binding (in some cases it is the IC\n50\n) in the concentration range of low nM to pM are achievable.\n\n\n[00160] In one example of aptamer selection, fibrinogen was immobilized to magnetic beads using amidation chemistry. A library of aptamer oligonucleotides containing 50 randomized positions was then amplified by PCR. The incorporation of boronic acid-modified nucleotide (B-TTP) was performed in the last round of polymerase reaction using a single primer. This single stranded DNA library was then exposed to fibrinogen-immobilized beads. DNA bound to immobilized fibrinogen \n\n was isolated and re-amplified. Radioactive dATP was used to incorporate a radiotracer for binding detection.\n\n\n[00161] Throughout the process, the percentage of radioactivity retained by immobilized fibrinogen was monitored as shown in Fig. 11. After the 4\nth\n round of selection, there was significant enrichment of radioactivity in the fibrinogen-bound fraction, as shown in Fig. 11. After the 8\nth\n round, there was over 20% of radioactivity retention by the immobilized fibrinogen. After the 13\nth\n round, nearly 80% of the radioactivity was retained by immobilized fibrinogen, indicating a high percentage of specific binders for the target glycoprotein.\n\n\n[00162] To minimize the selection of non-specific binders and those that would only bind to the protein portion of the glycoprotein, several counter-selection steps were built into the process. After the 6\nth\n round, the library was counter-selected against blank beads alone. The aim was to remove those aptamers that had nonspecific binding to the bead matrix. In addition, many aptamers without boronic acid incorporation may bind to fibrinogen. However, without the \"pull\" of the boronic acid moiety toward carbohydrates, such aptamers may randomly bind to various parts of fibrinogen without focusing on the glycosylation site, which would be undesirable. Therefore, to \"select out\" this pool that had no intrinsic preference for carbohydrates, and after the 13\nth\n round, the library was amplified using all natural dNTPs (without B- TTP) and the amplification products were incubated with immobilized fibrinogen. In this step, the only material collected was whatever remained unbound to the immobilized fibrinogen. Aptamers that could bind to fibrinogen without involving boronic acid interactions, and therefore did not have an intrinsic preference for carbohydrates, were eliminated. Such a counter selection step also allowed elimination of those aptamers that may have boronic acid incorporated, but do not depend on them for binding. Such aptamers probably would not have an intrinsic preference for carbohydrates either.\n\n\n[00163] After selection and counter selection, the enriched DNA library for each selection was cloned into E. coli. Several hundred of colonies appeared after overnight incubation of the transformed E. coli. Twenty colonies were randomly selected for sequence analysis. The sequences of aptamers thus selected as having a bias for a glycan chain of fibrinogen are shown in Fig. 25A-F as SEQ ID NOs.: 13- 74. Among the 20 colonies, the aptamer sequences of which were selected against glycosylated fibrinogen, three sequences, 85A (SEQ ID NO.: 13), 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14), and 85C (SEQ ID NO.: 15), appeared in both pre-counter-selection and post- counter-selection pools, and were selected for further analysis. \n\n [00164] Also prepared was DNA using a modified TTP (M-TTP (11), Fig. 1 ) as a control but which included a side chain that was not the boronic acid moiety. The M- TTP version of aptamer 85A showed a K\n6\n value (138 nM), which is 20 fold higher than that of the corresponding B-TTP-labeled aptamer. As an additional control study, B-TTP aptamer was treated with 30% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min at room temperature to remove the boronic acid group. The resulting aptamer showed a much higher K\nd\n value (173 nM) than did the B-TTP aptamer (Fig. 19A). Control experiments showed that the same hydrogen peroxide treatment of TTP aptamer resulted in no significant change in its K\nύ\n (139 nM) indicating DNA was stable under the hydrogen peroxide treatment conditions (Fig. 19B). [00165] With the decreased affinity of the TTP and M-TTP aptamers, the percentage of radioactivity of these two aptamers bound to fibrinogen is also much lower. For example, in the binding study between B-TTP aptamer with fibrinogen, at saturation about 60% of the radioactivity was retained on fibrinogen. In contrast, TTP and M-TTP aptamers showed only 25% and 20% radioactivity retention, respectively. Such results indicate that without boronic acid, there is a higher percentage of aptamer that does not adapt the needed conformation for proper binding to fibrinogen.\n\n\n[00166] The involvement of the boronic acid functional group in binding indicates that the aptamer binds to fibrinogen through at least some interactions with the carbohydrate sub-structure. To further examine this, deglycosylated fibrinogen was prepared according to the protocol of Weber (Anal. Biochem. 1981 , 118, 131 ; Biochem. J. 2003, 376, 339). Also, fibrinogen was treated with periodate, which cleaves diol structures on carbohydrates and therefore, changes the structural features of the carbohydrate portion of the glycoprotein. As shown, for example, in Figs. 14A-15B and 17A-18B, significantly reduced binding affinity for these aptamers was observed with deglycosylated and periodate-treated fibrinogen. For example, with deglycosylated fibrinogen, B-TTP aptamer 85A showed a 60-fold lower affinity with a Kd of 390 nM. On the other hand, the TTP aptamer of 85A showed a K\nά\n of 60 nM and the M-TTP aptamer 148 nM. With periodate-treated fibrinogen, the B-TTP aptamer 85A aptamer showed about 10-fold lower affinity than their binding with unmodified fibrinogen with K\nd\n of 70 nM. Such results suggest that the sugar portion is indeed intimately involved in the binding. Also, the aptamer binds to fibrinogen even after sugar modification. This indicates that the aptamers also recognize the protein portion of fibrinogen, which is very much desirable since aptamers that only bind to the sugar portion would not have limited diagnostic value for the specific \n\n recognition of an intact glycoprotein due to possible interference by other carbohydrates.\n\n\n[00167] After the 13\nth\n round of counter-selection, the pool was counter selected against immobilized deglycosylated fibrinogen in one more round. The solution portion which should have aptamers that rely on recognition of the carbohydrate portion for tight binding was collected. Twenty colonies were picked after cloning the pool into E coli. Out of these 20, 16 sequences also appeared in the previous batch selected without this last counter selection step. The aptamers from both selections are SEQ ID NOs.: 13-74, shown in Figs. 25A-25F. [00168] Though the binding constants of B-TTP aptamers changed very significantly when the carbohydrate portion of fibrinogen was modified, the change in binding affinity for TTP aptamers was much less significant. TTP aptamers do not have the boronic acid functional group to provide strong interactions with the carbohydrate moiety. Therefore, changes in carbohydrate structures, whether it is their removal or oxidation, are not expected to significantly affect TTP aptamer binding. Such results indicate that the structure of the non-carbohydrate portion did not change much to affect TTP aptamer binding. Fluorescent aptamers\n\n\n[00169] The present disclosure further encompasses incorporating fluorescent boronic acids that change fluorescent properties upon sugar binding. Such boronic acid-nucleotide conjugates are useful for the preparation of boronic acid-modified aptamers for detection and/or recognition of carbohydrate-containing molecules such as glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycopeptides, aminoglycosides, and carbohydrates. [00170] Some boronic acids that show significant changes in fluorescent properties upon binding to saccharides are illustrated in Fig. 24, including 8- quinolineboronic acid (6), 5-quinolineboronic acid (7), isoquinolineboronic acid (8), A- dimethylaminonaphthaleneboronic acid (9), 5-dimethylaminonaphthaleneboronic acid (10), 2-thiopheneboronic acid (11), dibenzofuran-boronic acid, indoleboronic acids (e.g., 12), amidoboronic acids (e.g. 13) naphthalimide-based boronic acid (14). Figs. 22 and 23 show two typical examples of such fluorescent property changes by these reporter compounds.\n\n\nSynthesis of Naphthalimide-based Long-wavelength Boronic Acid Modified TTP (N- TTP)\n\n\n[00171] The long-wavelength fluorescent Λ/-TTP resembles B-TTP with the exception that group R\n5\n is napthalimide-based boronic acid (as shown in Fig. 32). Synthesis of the boronic acid moiety starts from NaBH\n4\n reduction of 4- (hydroxymethyl)benzonitrile into 4-aminomethylbenzyl alcohol (b of Fig. 31) followed \n\n by Boc- protection of the -NH\n2\n group and mesylation of the -OH group. Alkylation of 4-amino-1 ,8-naphthalimide with (4-Boc-aminomethylbenzyl) methansulfonate and 2- bromobenzyl bromide sequentially yields the aromatic bromide (f), which is subjected to Pd catalyzed borylation in a subsequent step. The obtained fluorescent boronic acid is deprotected of its Boc- group by using TFA and then coupled with azidoacetic acid by using EDCI and HOBt.\n\n\n[00172] Tethering of the synthesized naphthalimide-based boronic acid with M- TTP was accomplished using the click chemistry as described in the synthesis of B- TTP. In one kind of click chemistry, Cu(l)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition developed by Sharpless (KoIb et al. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2001 , 40: 2004; Wang, et al.; J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2003, 125: 3192-3193) has been proven to be a very efficient way of linking a large fluorophore group to biomolecules. In the coupling step as shown in Scheme 2, Fig. 32, tris(triazolyl)amine was added as a Cu ligand to accelerate the reaction rate and also to protect the boronic acid unit from metal- catalyzed degradation.\n\n\n[00173] A specific example of the preparation of one such fluorescent compound is shown in Schematic 5 shown in Fig. 21. Anthracene boronic acid compounds such as (3) shown in Fig. 21 change fluorescent properties upon sugar binding. To determine whether conjugates of such boronic acid fluorescent reporters with amines or deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate would still retain their ability to change fluorescence properties upon sugar binding, we synthesized compounds (4) and (6) (Scheme 5, Fig. 21). Both compounds (4) and (6) changed fluorescent properties upon sugar binding, as shown in Figs. 22 and 23. Such results confirmed the suitability of similar fluorescent boronic acids for incorporation into DNA for the development of boronic acid-modified DNA aptamer, which would change fluorescent properties upon sugar binding.\n\n\nNucleic acid-based aptamers that have anticoagulant effect by binding with fibrinogen\n\n\n[00174] Blood coagulation is the result of a complex cascade of enzymic reactions, including reactions that regulate thrombus formation to prevent undesirable clotting and blockage of a blood vessel. It is an important process of self-repair with the activation of several factors and enzymes in necessary for hemostasis. Disorders of coagulation that reduce thrombus formation can lead to hemorrhage. On the other hand, thrombus formation other in wound repair, or maintaining hemostasis, may result in a life-threatening cardiovascular blockage. [00175] Thrombosis is understood to be a pathologic process in which a platelet aggregate and/or a fibrin clot forms in the lumen of an intact blood vessel or in a \n\n cardiac chamber. A thrombotic blockage can result in serious diseases, such as ischemic necrosis and pulmonary embolism, and massive pulmonary embolism can cause hypoxemia, shock and death. Therefore, antithrombotic therapies are extensively studied and utilized.\n\n\n[00176] Fibrinogen circulates in the blood as the precursor of fibrin, the scaffold material of a blood clot. It plays a key role in platelet aggregation, the final step of the coagulation cascade, and is a major determinant of plasma viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation. Fibrinogen is composed of 3 pairs of non-identical chains, Aa, Bβ, and Y, with a combined molecular weight of 340 kDa. It contains approximately 3% carbohydrate consisting of NeuAc, GaI, Man, and GIcNAc, the sequence of a glycan chain being shown in Fig. 28. From amino acid sequence studies, it has been determined that carbohydrate is linked to Asn 52 on the γ-chain and Asn 364 on the Bβ-chain.\n\n\n[00177] Since fibrinogen is a major participant of the coagulation pathway, it is a major target for novel anticoagulant therapeutics. Several types of anticoagulants have been used in vivo as medications for thrombotic disorders. For example, Coumadin (warfarin) as an oral anticoagulant works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Abciximab is a platelet aggregation inhibitor (monoclonal antibody) mainly used during and after coronary artery procedures, and is typically delivered intravenously. It inhibits glycoprotein llb/llla binding to fibrinogen and therefore inhibits its conversion to fibrin. Heparin is a widely used injectable anticoagulant that activates antithrombin III, thereby blocking thrombin, the protease responsible for cleaving fibrinogen into fibrin. Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, also has an anti-platelet or \"anti-clotting\" effect and is used in long-term at low doses to prevent heart attacks and blood clot formation in people at high risk for developing blood clots. MK-383, a type of RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) compound, dose-dependently inhibits fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation.\n\n\n[00178] The last group of anticoagulants directly inhibits thrombin itself by direct interaction with the protein. They can delay or even prevent blood clotting by directly inhibiting the enzyme thrombin. Advantageously, some of the thrombin inactivators, unlike the other agents able to regulate thrombus formation, have antidotes, which may allow for controlled inhibition of the thrombin, and also intervention if a patient is over-dosed during treatment which could lead to undesirable or fatal hemorrhaging. [00179] The present disclosure, however, encompasses aptamer anti-coagulants that directly bind with glycosylated fibrinogen and thereby inhibit thrombus formation, and offer a means of neutralizing the anti-coagulant by co-administering a complementary oligonucleotide that can combine with the aptamer. The present \n\n disclosure, therefore, provides a number of glycosylated fibrinogen-specific aptamers that can inhibit thrombin-mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the critical last step in blood clotting.\n\n\n[00180] When a solution of fibrinogen is converted to fibrin, which then coagulates, a white gel is formed. Gel formation is accompanied by an increase in absorption of UV compared to the transparent solution.

(k) N-[2-(3, 4-Dihydroxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-acrylamide (13) [00232] To a suspension of dopamine hydrochloride (3 g, 16 mmol) in dichloromethane (35 mL) was added triethylamine (6.7 ml_). The mixture was stirred for 1 h then trimethylchlorosilane was added. After 4 h, additional triethylamine (2.5 mL) was added followed by acryloyl chloride in a dropwise fashion with an ice-bath cooling. After stirring the reaction for 12 h, the white precipitate was filtered, collected, and re-dissolved in 30 mL dichloromethane followed by the addition of 10% tetrafluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane. The reaction mixture was stirred over night at room temperature.

Inc.) and 2.0 μL of γ-\n32\nP-ATP (from Perkin/Elmer) was incubated for 1 hr at 37 \n0\nC followed by heating in a water-bath at 100 \n0\nC for 5 min to denature the T4 polynucleotide kinase. The phosphorylated DNA was precipitated with 2.2 μL of 3 M sodium chloride solution and 66.6 μL of ethanol. The mixture was chilled at -20\n0\nC for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-dissolved in 8 μL of water (to obtain approximately 100 μM DNA solution, assuming an 80% recovery yield), and stored at - 20 \n0\nC. Example 3\n\n\nDNA primer extension and time-course study of incorporation of B-TTP (12) into DNA primer extensions\n\n\n[00234] Primer extensions were performed with 5'-\n32\nP-labeled Primer 21 -nt (SEQ ID NO.: 1 , shown in Fig. 25) (5 μM), and the oligonucleotide Template 1 (SEQ ID NO.: 4) (5 μM), Klenow (0.04 units/μL); and dNTPs (0.4 mM each). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37\n0\nC. Aliquots (5 μL) of the solution were taken at 0.5 min, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min and 60 min and were put into an ice-bath to stop the reaction following the addition of 5 μL of denaturing dye solution (8 M urea) into each aliquot. These samples were analyzed later by electrophoresis and autoradiography, the results of which are illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\n\n[00235] As shown in Fig. 5, there was no noticeable difference in the rate of incorporation of natural TTP and B-TTP. For example, at 0.5 min, neither the B-TTP nor the natural TTP was incorporated significantly. From time 0 to 15 min, there was time-dependent incorporation in both cases. At 15 min, both reactions reached maximal incorporation. Control reactions with only the primer, without enzyme, and without added TTP or labeled TTP showed no full-length DNA formation. The smear in the third lane (Fig. 5) without TTP was from mismatch pairing and incomplete reaction. All these indicate that the boronic acid labeled base, B-TTP (12), was recognized by the Klenow fragment at approximately the same level as natural TTP. B-TTP DNA and TTP-DNA were not well-separated when using 19% acrylamide gel (Fig. 5), but were well resolved when using 15% acrylamide gel, as shown in Fig. 6. \n\n Example 4\n\n\nPreparation of the polyacrylamide gel containing catechol\n\n\n[00236] 19% acrylamide gels modified with 1 % catechohurea (12.6 g), Λ/-[2-(3, A- dihydroxy-pheπyl)-ethyl]-acrylamide (0.16 g), a 40% acrylamide solution (24 ml_), 5\nχ\n \n\n\nTBE (Tris-borate-EDTA made from 108 g Tris base, 55 g boric acid, 9.3 g Na\n4\nEDTA in 1 L of water) (6 ml_) and water (6 ml_) were mixed and heated in a microwave for\n\n\n30 seconds. After cooling, 20 μL of TEMED (N, N, Λ/-tetramethylethylenediamine) and 150 μL of APS (ammonium persulfate) were added before loading this solution into a gel cast.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nPrimer extension using boronic acid-labeled DNA as templates\n\n\n[00237] Primer 1 (SEQ ID NO.: 2) and oligonucleotide Template 1 (SEQ ID NO.:\n\n\n4) (5 μM), Klenow (0.04 units/μL), TTP (0.4 mM), B-TTP (0.4 mM) or M-TTP (0.4 mM), and three other dNTPs (0.4 mM each) were incubated at 37° C for an hour. The prepared DNAs were purified by membrane filtration for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, using Microcon centrifugal filter YM-3 from Millipore Corporation, to remove the labeled and non-labeled dNTPs and other low molecular weigh molecules. 5'-\n32\nP- labeled Primer 2 (SEQ ID NO.: 3) was then added to the DNAs prepared using Primer 1 , individually, and the mixtures were heated for 2 min at 95 C. The mixtures were cooled to room temperature over 10 min. The second run of the polymerizations on the labeled and non-labeled DNA templates was performed under the conditions of four dNTPs (0.4 mM each) and Klenow (0.04 units/μL) at 37° C for an hour. The resulted samples were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography.\n\n\n[00238] The primer extension reaction using natural TTP yielded a DNA product with molecular weight of about 6512 Da as determined using MALDI mass spectrometry (calculated molecular weight: 6518.2 Da) (see Fig. 4). The same reaction using B-TTP yielded a DNA product with a molecular weight of about 6941\n\n\nDa (calculated molecular weight: 6930.2 Da). Such results demonstrated the successful incorporation of the boronic acid-labeled thymidine unit.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nIncorporation of B-TTP into DNA by PCR\n\n\n[00239] Each 50 μl reaction was performed with 1.2 μM of Primer 3 (SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n5) and Primer 4 (SEQ ID NO.: 6), and oligonucleotide Template 2 (SEQ ID NO.: 7), 0.25 mM of each dNTPs, 0.25mM of labeled-TTP (B-TTP), and 3.5 units of High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.) under conditions of 1 cycle at 94 \n0\nC for 2 min, 30 cycles at 94 \n0\nC for 20 s, 59 \n0\nC for 30 s, 72 \n0\nC for 1 min, and 1 cycle \n\n at 72 \n0\nC for 7 min. Ten microliters of each amplification product was separated by gel electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. Example 8\n\n\nImmobilization of beads\n\n\n[00240] 25 μl_ of BioMag Carboxyl beads (Bangs Laboratories, Inc. Fishers, IN) were washed four times with 0.5 ml. of coupling buffer (0.01 M K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.15 M NaCI at pH 5.5). The supernatant was aspirated to leave the beads as a wet cake on the container wall. 0.5 mL of coupling agent (20 mg EDCI in 20 ml_ of water) was added to beads and the mixture was shaken briefly for 30 min. Fifty mg of fibrinogen in 22 mL of coupling buffer was added and the mixture was shaken overnight. The beads were separated by magnetic separator and washed by 5 mL of wash buffer (0.01 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCI, 0.1% w/v BSA, 0.1% NaN\n3\n and 0.001 EDTA at pH 7.4) three times. The immobilized beads were stored at 2-8\n0\nC as a suspension in wash buffer. During this phase, the immobilization efficiency was monitored by the Kaiser test (Kaiser et ai, Anal. Biochem. 1970, 34, 595-598). Example 8\n\n\nDeglycosylation of fibrinogen\n\n\n[00241] The carbohydrate moiety in fibrinogen was cleaved by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS)-mediated chemical deglycosylation strategies (Edge et al., Anal. Biochem. 1981 , 118, 131-137; Edge A.S., Biochem. J. 2003, 376, 339-350). To 100 mg of pre-cooled fibrinogen in an absolute dry reaction vial was added 1.5 mL of the pre-cooled TFMS, the vial was then sealed and gently shaken for 2-5 min until the protein was completely dissolved. The vial was then incubated on ice for additional 25 min with occasional shaking. 400 μL of a 0.2% bromophenol blue solution as an indicator was added into the reaction vial and the resulting mixture was gently shaken. Then a total of approximately 30 mL of pre-cooled 60% pyridine was added immediately until the solution color changed from red to blue. The deglycosylated protein was then purified by Sephadex G-25 medium (GE Healthcare) and the elution was dried by a vacuum-freeze evaporator. Example 9\n\n\nPeriodation of fibrinogen\n\n\n[00242] Sodium acetate (100 mL, 10 mM) was added to a solution of 100 mg of fibrinogen in 100 mL of 0.2 mM sodium periodate. The mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice-bath. 10 mL of 10 mM glycerol was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature to consume the excess periodate. The resulting fibrinogen was purified by IWT TMD-8 ion-exchange resin (Sigma-Aldrich) \n\n and concentrated using a vacuum-freeze evaporator (lyopholizer or freeze dryer). (See, J. Biol. Chem. 1964, 239, 567; J. Biol. Chem. 1962, 237, 1021). Example 10\n\n\nSELEX selection ofaptamers\n\n\n[00243] Oligonucleotide Template 5 (SEQ ID NO.: 10) containing 50 randomized positions and complementary at its ends to Primer 20.227 (SEQ ID NO.: 11) and Primer 20.226 (SEQ ID NO.: 12) were synthesized. The starting dsDNA library was constructed by a 25-round PCR amplification using Taq polymerase from DNA template in the presence of four standard nucleotides (dNTPs) by Eppendorf thermal cycler. The PCR product was then concentrated by a YM-30 spin column (Millipore). The ssDNA pool was then prepared by one-round PCR using the above dsDNA product using [α-\n32\nP] dATP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP and B-TTP. The DNA pool was incubated with the fribrinogen-immobilized BioMag carboxyl beads for one hour in binding buffer (300 mM NaCI, 5 mM MgCI\n2\n, 20 mM Tris-HCI at pH 7.6). The incubated beads were then separated by using a magnetic separator and washed by buffer for six times and then fribrinogen-containing (10 μg/mL) binding buffer for three times. Aliquots (20 μl_) were taken from every washing, and radioactivity in each aliquot was determined using a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. The fractions from the fibrinogen washings were combined, extracted with phenol, precipitated in ethanol, and amplified by PCR for the next round of SELEX using the same protocol, as shown in Scheme 4, Fig. 20. Example 11\n\n\nMolecular Cloning and Sequencing\n\n\n[00244] Clones of the ssDNA pool were prepared after 13 rounds of SELEX selection as described in Example 10. An aliquot of the ssDNA solution was PCR amplified. The PCR reagent mix and cycling conditions were similar to those described above and only 20 PCR cycles were performed. Final extension was carried out for 15 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was ligated into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Sigma, St. Louis, MO at room temperature for 30 min. This ligation product was transformed into One Shot TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli on ice for 30 min and heat-shocked at 42 \n0\nC for 30 sec and the transformation liquid was spread on a pre-warmed LB plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Hundreds of colonies were raised. Forty colonies were picked up at random and individually cultured overnight in LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Plasmids from these colonies were isolated and purified using the PURELINK\n™\n HQ Mini Plasmid Purification Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and sequenced using the T3 promoter primer. \n\n Example 12\n\n\nBinding Assays\n\n\n[00245] Dissociation constants in solution were determined by equilibrium filtration (Jenison et al., Science 1994, 263, 1425-1429; Huang & Szostak, RNA 2003, 9: 1456-1463;). Using this technique, the bound and unbound ligand (DNA) partition between the two portions were separated by a membrane. DNA was first amplified into dsDNA using two primers by PCR (25 cycles of 0.5 min at 94\n0\nC, 0.5 min at 46 \n0\nC, and 0.5 min at 72 \n0\nC, followed by 5 min at 72 \n0\nC). The dsDNA product was then split into ssDNA using one primer and α-\n32\nP-dATP by one-round PCR. The \n32\nP- labeled ssDNA ligand (10 nM) and the protein (1-1000 nM) in the 100 μl_ of binding buffer were incubated for 15 min at 25 \"C prior to loading into the Microcon YM-100 unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The solution was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 sec to saturate the membrane, and the filtrate was transferred back to the unit. The solution was centrifuged for another 20 sec, and the filtrate (about 10 μl_) was collected. Aliquots (10 μL) were taken from both the remaining solution and the filtrate, and radioactivity in each aliquot was determined by Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. All binding assays were duplicated. The equilibrium dissociation constants [K\nd\n) of the ligand-protein interaction were obtained by fitting the dependence of bound fractions of specific binding on the concentration of the aptamers to the equation Y = B max X/(K\nύ\n + X), using the SigmaPlot program. [00246] To determine the extent to which the aptamers 85A (SEQ ID NO.: 13), 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14), and 85C (SEQ ID NO.: 15) bind specifically to fibrinogen, their dissociation constants (K\nd\n) were measured using the equilibrium filtration method with radiolabeled α-\n32\nP-dATP. The binding curves for aptamer 85A (SEQ ID NO.: 13) incorporating TTP, -TTP, or M-TTP are shown in Figs 12A-12C. The target substrate to which the aptamer was binding was fibrinogen (Fig. 12A), deglycosylated fibrinogen (Fig. 12B) and periodated fibrinogen (Fig. 12C). The results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. For aptamers 85B and 85C, the binding curves are shown in Figs 13A-19B.\n\n\nTable 1: Bindin constants of a tamers with fibrino en\n\n\n \n\n Table 2: Calculated dissociation constants (nM) ofaptamers with different fibrinogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Comparison of aptamer 85A binding (Kd (nM)) when labeled with a B-TTP, unlabeled TTP or when the B-TTP is retreated with eroxide \n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: S ecificit of bindin of a tamer 85A with different l co roteins \n\n\n\n\n\n[00250] All boronic acid-labeled aptamers (B-TTP aptamers) bind fibrinogen with K\nd\n values in the low nM range. In contrast, the DNA pool after the 13\nth\n round of selection showed an average K\nd\n of about 5 μM. The same aptamers prepared using all natural dNTPs (TTP aptamers) were also tested. These TTP aptamers showed K\nA\n values that were 10-20 fold higher than that of B-TTP aptamers. For example, with aptamer 85A the K\nύ\n of B-TTP aptamer for fibrinogen is 6 nM, while the K\nΛ\n for the corresponding unlabeled TTP aptamer is 101 nM (Table 3), thereby showing that boronic acid was indeed involved in binding.\n\n\n[00251] Although aptamers 85A and 85B have different nucleotide sequences (SEQ ID NOS.: 15 and 16 respectively) competitive binding occurs between these two aptamers and the target fibrinogen, as shown by the graphical results illustrated in Fig. 29.\n\n\n[00252] Binding of aptamers of the present disclosure to fibrinogen was unaffected by the presence of 10 mM glucose, as shown in Fig. 29B. Indeed, the binding constants of a phenylboronic acid against a variety of diol sugars both shows the selective binding of a boronic acid to diols, and that binding is minimal to glucose itself, as shown in Table 5.\n\n\n \n \n\n Example 17\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n[00253] All samples and buffers were prepared by using de-ionized water. Fibrinogen was from human plasma and comprised about 60% protein (Sigma- Aldrich). Thrombin was from human plasma (Sigma-Aldrich). Anticoagulant test\n\n\n[00254] The buffer solution was 300 mM NaCI, 5 mM MgCI\n2\n, 20 mM Tris-HCI at pH 7.6. Fibrinogen was dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 17.6 μM, and was kept at 4 \"C for use within one week. Thrombin was dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 100 IU/mL. CaCI\n2\n was dissolved in buffer solution to 100 mM. Fibrinogen was diluted to 4.4 μM, and the CaCI\n2\n stock solution was diluted to 20 mM using buffer solution. Thrombin was diluted to 2 IU/mL as the final concentration. The aptamers were added at different concentrations (0.1 μM, 0.25 μM and 0.5 μM).\n\n\n[00255] As soon as the thrombin solution was mixed with fibrinogen, the absorption was tested immediately and every 20 seconds thereafter until absorption came to a plateau at 37 \n0\nC. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Wallac 1420 multi plate reader (PerkinElmer Inc., Massachusetts, USA) as shown in Figs 30A-30D. Example 18\n\n\n[00256] Introduction of the boronic acid moiety was accomplished through tethering to the 5-position of TTP, which was verified to incorporate into DNA by DNA polymerase (according to Lin et al., (2007). Nucleic Acids Res., 35: 1222-1229, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). After selection and cloning, twenty DNA sequences were randomly selected for evaluation. All these aptamers could recognize fibrinogen through binding at a glycosylation site and thus were useful tools for probing the effect of glycosylation pattern changes on the ability for fibrinogen to mediate blood coagulation. In addition, these aptamers also have anticoagulation effects.\n\n\n[00257] To understand the aptamer's structural effect on fibrinogen binding, and for the development of shorter oligonucleotides capable of fibrinogen binding, aptamer 85B was selected as a model to test the effect of replacing boronic acid- modified thymidine at individual positions on binding to fibrinogen. Accordingly, in aptamer 85B SEQ ID NO.: 14), T positions (except the primer position) were successively substituted by A and binding affinities were examined to see which T was critical to binding (representative sequences (SEQ ID NOs.: 70-74) with modified T positions are shown, for example, in Fig. 25F). \n\n B-TTP modified DNA\n\n\n[00258] The aptamer 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14) and its mutations were used as templates. The starting dsDNA library was constructed by a 26-round PCR amplification using Taq polymerase, two primers from DNA template in the presence of four standard nucleotides (dNTPs) using a Effendorf thermal cycler. The PCR product was then concentrated by a YM-10 spin column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The single-stranded DNA pool was then prepared by two-rounds of PCR using the above double-stranded DNA product using dATP, dCTP, dGTP and B-TTP with 5'- biotin labeled primer. The DNA pool was denatured at 94 \n0\nC for 5 min, and then incubated on ice immediately. Example 19 SPR test\n\n\n[00259] 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 M NHS were mixed in water. After degassing, 500 μl_ of this EDC-NHS solution was infused into both channels on the chip over a period of about 10 min (twice). Then a 1 mg/mL streptavidin stock solution was diluted 10-fold with 20 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.2. The streptavidin solution (500 μl_) was infused into both the detection and control channels over about 10 min period. The sensogram clearly showed immobilization (over 1000 μRIU). 1 M ethanolamine HCI solution (500 μL) (pH 8.5) was infused in over a period of 3 min to cap un-reacted (and activated) carboxyl sites. Then biotin-labeled aptamer (B-TTP or d-TTP) solution (500 μL, in PBS/T) was infused into the detection channel only over a period of about 10 min (twice). After aptamer immobilization, different fibrinogen concentrations were used in binding studies. In each run, fibrinogen solution was infused in at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min for 6 min. After each injection, 1 M ethanolamine HCI (pH 8.5) solution was infused in as the regeneration solution. All experiments were duplicated.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n[00260] All the modified aptamers were labeled with biotin at 5' position.\n\n\nTherefore, they were readily immobilized on a strepavidin coated chip. An all-dTTP sequence could be used directly for the binding assay. B-TTP-modified DNA could be obtained by utilizing PCR amplification from original dTTP template. B-TTP and biotin-labeled primer were used for the last cycle of PCR to obtain the 5'-biotin labeled, B-TTP-incorporated aptamer.\n\n\n[00261] The K\nD\n values were obtained for aptamer 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14) and its mutational analogs by using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument. SPR is a method to detect the index of the refraction of surface bound layers, as described by Karlsson ef a/., (2000) J. Anal. Biochem. 278: 1-13, and Shimomura ef a/., (2001) \n\n Anal. Chim. Acta. 434: 223-230 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). This method has been used to determine the kinetic on and off rates for the interactions between biomolecules and binding receptors. In the aptamer- fibrinogen binding studies, streptavidin was immobilized to chips coated with a SAM surface that has terminal carboxyl functional groups. Biotin-labeled DNA was subsequently immobilized on the chip through biotin-streptavidin interactions. Fibrinogen solutions of various concentrations were then used for binding constant determination using kinetic data, as described by Lin et al., (2007). Nucleic Acids Res., 35: 1222-1229; Schuck, P. (1997) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 8: 498-502; Myszka, D. G. (2000) Methods Enzymol. 323: 325-340; and Myszka & Rich (2000) Pharm. Sci. Technology Today 3: 310-317. Table 6 lists the K\nD\n values of 85B and its mutations.\n\n\nTable 6: Dissociation Constants (nM) ofAptamers with Fibrinogen (All studies were done in duplicate or triplicate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00262] Figs. 31A-31D shows several examples of binding test results. From Table 1 , it can be seen that all the B-TTP-modified aptamers have higher binding affinity compared to the dTTP analogs. For example, 85B-BTTP has a K\n0\n value of 10.1 nM while 85B-dTTP has a K\nD\n value of 127 nM. This is due to the incorporation of boronic acid units which have a binding reaction between the boronic acid and the sugar moieties on fibrinogen (see Lief a/., (2008) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130: 12636- 12638.\n\n\n[00263] Different mutational analogs have varying K\n0\n values. Five mutated aptamers, 85B-1 (SEQ ID NO.: 70) and 85B-5 (SEQ ID NO.: 74) have higher K\nD\n values compared to the original 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14). For B-TTP-modified DNA aptamers, 85B1-BTTP had K\nD\n 205 nM and 85B5-BTTP had a K\nD\n 329 nM. Compared to the original 85B-BTTP (10.1 nM), the activity decreased almost 20-30 folds. Without wishing to be bound by any one theory, 1 ) mutations at positions 34 of the sequence of aptamer 85B, i.e. 85B1 (SEQ ID NO.: 70), and at 67 (85B5 (SEQ ID NO.: 74)) significantly affected the binding between aptamer and fibrinogen, as shown in Figs. 32A-32D; 2) B-TTP in these two (34 and 67) positions plays a role in binding with fibrinogen. \n\n [00264] Aptamer 85B2-BTTP also had a little higher K\nD\n (63.7 nM) compared to 85B3 (17.6 nM) and 85B4 (11.2 nM). Thus, B-TTP in this position may also help binding between aptamer and fibrinogen, though less significantly than at positions 34 and 67.\n\n\n[00265] For dTTP, 85B1 (SEQ ID NO.: 70) and 85B5 (SEQ ID NO.: 74) have K\n0\n values of 507 nM and 1083 nM, respectively. Compared to the 85B-dTTP (K\nD\n: 127 nM), they have 5-10 fold difference. This result also verified that positions 34 and 67 are important in the binding. Since they don't have B-TTP incorporated, the binding difference was not as significant as for the B-TTP group. For 85B2-dTTP, the K\n0\n of 127 nM is the same as 85B-dTTP, while B-TTP modified 85B-2 had higher K\nD\n value compared to 85B. Therefore, it again supported that B-TTP plays a role in binding between the aptamers and fibrinogen.\n\n\n[00266] To further understand the SAR, a secondary structure analysis was performed by using the online software M-fold as described by Zuker, M. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31 : 3406-3415, and Mathews et al., (1999) J. MoI. Biol, 288: 911- 940, incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. This M-fold web server was used for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction. In this case, aptamer sequence 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14) was inputted with salt conditions (300 mM Na\n+\n and 5mM Mg\n+\n) presented. The predicted secondary structure is shown in Fig. 32. [00267] The secondary structure prediction indicated three major loops and 2 double strands regions in the aptamer 85B (SEQ ID NO.: 14). From this structure, some structure activity relationship could be obtained: 1) Positions 34 and 67 were critical to binding. When T was mutated to A, the K\n0\n value increased 5-fold and 10- fold respectively; 2) If a particular T base is substituted by A base, structure in this region may change and thus affect binding; 3) when position 67 was mutated from T to A, the base pairing between A and T was abolished and the secondary structure was expected to change, resulting in changes in binding affinity; and 4) positions 48, 49 and 57 have little effect on the binding of the aptamer to fibrinogen. All these analysis were consistent with the experimental results as shown in Table 1. [00268] Accordingly, the binding affinity tests indicate that only positions 34 and 67 are critical for binding. The secondary structure also suggested that T in specific positions plays a key role in the binding assay."

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOcular hypotensive agents are useful in the treatment of a number of various ocular hypertensive conditions, such as post-surgical and post-laser trabeculectomy ocular hypertensive episodes, glaucoma, and as presurgical adjuncts.\n\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by increased intraocular pressure. On the basis of its etiology, glaucoma has been classified as primary or secondary. For example, primary glaucoma in adults (congenital glaucoma) may be either open-angle or acute or chronic angle-closure. Secondary glaucoma results from pre-existing ocular diseases such as uveitis, intraocular tumor or an enlarged cataract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe underlying causes of primary glaucoma are not yet known. The increased intraocular tension is due to the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the anterior chamber and its anatomic structures appear normal, but drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded. In acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma, the anterior chamber is shallow, the filtration angle is narrowed, and the iris may obstruct the trabecular meshwork at the entrance of the canal of Schlemm. Dilation of the pupil may push the root of the iris forward against the angle, and may produce pupilary block and thus precipitate an acute attack. Eyes with narrow anterior chamber angles are predisposed to acute angle-closure glaucoma attacks of various degrees of severity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSecondary glaucoma is caused by any interference with the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber and subsequently, into the canal of Schlemm. Inflammatory disease of the anterior segment may prevent aqueous escape by causing complete posterior synechia in iris bombe, and may plug the drainage channel with exudates. Other common causes are intraocular tumors, enlarged cataracts, central retinal vein occlusion, trauma to the eye, operative procedures and intraocular hemorrhage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsidering all types together, glaucoma occurs in about 2% of all persons over the age of 40 and may be asymptotic for years before progressing to rapid loss of vision. In cases where surgery is not indicated, topical β-adrenoreceptor antagonists have traditionally been the drugs of choice for treating glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain eicosanoids and their derivatives are currently commercially available for use in glaucoma management Eicosanoids and derivatives include numerous biologically important compounds such as prostaglandins and their derivatives. Prostaglandins can be described as derivatives of prostanoic acid which have the following structural formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious types of prostaglandins are known, depending on the structure and substituents carried on the alicyclic ring of the prostanoic acid skeleton. Further classification is based on the number of unsaturated bonds in the side chain indicated by numerical subscripts after the generic type of prostaglandin [e.g. prostaglandin E\n1\n (PGE\n1\n), prostaglandin E\n2\n (PGE\n2\n)], and on the configuration of the substituents on the alicyclic ring indicated by α or β [e.g. prostaglandin F\n2α\n (PGr\n2β\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 95/19964\n \n discloses compounds of formula I:\n\n \n \n\nwherein the wavy bonds indicate that α or β configuration, the dashed bond represents either a single or double bond, which double bond may be a cis or trans double bond and R is a saturated or unsaturated acyclic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, or -(CH\n2\n)\nm\nR, wherein m is 0-10, and R\n1\n is an aliphatic ring having from about 3 to about 7 carbon atoms, or an aryl or heteraryl ring having from about 4 to about 10 carbon atoms and wherein the heteroatom is selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. These compounds are said to be useful in methods of treating ocular hypertension.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDisposed herein is a compound having a structure\n\n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutical salt thereof,\n\nwherein is an organic acid functional group, or an amide or ester thereof comprising up to 14 carbon atoms; or Y is hydroxymethyl or an ether thereof comprising up to 14 carbon atoms: or Y is a tetrazolyl functional group;\n\nA is-(CH\n2\n)\n5\n-, cis -CH\n2\nH=CH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-, or -CH\n2\nC≡C-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-, wherein 1 or 2 carbon atoms may be replaced by S or O; or A is - (CH\n2\n)\nm\n-Ar-(CH\n2\n)\no\n- wherein Ar is interarylene or heterointerarylene, the sum of m and o is 1, 2, 3. or 4, and wherein one CH\n2\n may be replaced by S or O:\n\nJ is C=O, CHOH.

Specifically, a drug to be administered systemically, it may be confected as a powder, pill, or tablet, or as a solution, emulsion, suspension, aerosol, syrup or elixir suitable for oral or parenteral administration or inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor solid dosage forms or medicaments, non-toxic solid carriers include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, the polyalkylene glycols, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose and magnesium carbonate. The solid dosage forms may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108\n \n; \n \n4,166,452\n \n; and \n \n4,265,874\n \n to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable dosage forms can, for example, comprise a solution or suspension of one or more of the presently useful compounds and optional pharmaceutical adjutants in a carrier, such as for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like. Typical examples of such auxiliary agents are sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 16th Edition, 1980\n. The composition of the formulation to be administered, in any event, contains a quantity of one or more of the presently useful compounds in an amount effective to provide the desired therapeutic effect\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol and ethanol. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents and, pH buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the presently useful compound or compounds administered is dependent on the therapeutic effect or effects desired, on the specific mammal being treated, on the severity and nature of the mammal's condition, on the manner of administration, on the potency and pharmacodynamics of the particular compound or compounds employed, and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. The therapeutically effective dosage of the presently useful compound or compounds may be in the range of about 0.5 or about 1 to about 100 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA liquid which is ophthalmically acceptable is formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort should be maximized as much as possible, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort cannot be maximized, the liquid should be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use. Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid should either be packaged for single use, or contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ophthalmic application, solutions or medicaments are often prepared using a physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. Ophthalmic solutions should preferably be maintained at a comfortable pH with an appropriate buffer system. The formulations may also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A useful surfactant is, for example, Tween 80. Likewise, various useful vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations of the present invention. These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and purified water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTonicity adjustors may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but are not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and glycerin, or any other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity adjustor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used so long as the resulting preparation is ophthalmically acceptable. Accordingly, buffers include acetate buffers, citrate buffers, phosphate buffers and borate buffers. Acids or bases may be used to adjust the pH of these formulations as needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar vein, an ophthalmically acceptable antioxidant for use in the present invention includes, but is not limited to, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther excipient components which may be included in the ophthalmic preparations are chelating agents. A useful chelating agent is edetate disodium, although other chelating agents may also be used in place or in conjunction with it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ingredients are usually used in the following amounts:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIngredient\n \n \n \nAmount (% w/v)\n \n \n \n \nactive ingredient\n \nabout 0.001-5\n \n \n \npreservative\n \n0-0.10\n \n \n \nvehicle\n \n0-40\n \n \n \ntonicity adjustor\n \n1-10\n \n \n \nbuffer\n \n0.01-10\n \n \n \npH adjustor\n \nq.s. pH 4.5-7.5\n \n \n \nantioxidant\n \nas needed\n \n \n \nsurfactant\n \nas needed\n \n \n \npurified water\n \nas needed to make 100%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound disclosed herein are employed.

Use of protecting groups for additional carbonyl groups which can be part of M\n4\n may be necessary. Standard protection and deprotection is known in the art to carry this out. The fluoroalkylation may also be carried out an earlier point in the synthetic procedure. Such decisions are well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nBinding Data\n\n\n\n\nKi\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompetition binding experiments were performed in a medium containing Hank's balanced salt solution, Hepes 20 mM, pH 7.3, membranes (-60 µg protein) or 2x10\n5\n cells from HEK 293 cells stably expressing human EP2 receptors, [\n3\nH]PGE2 (10 nM) and various concentrations of test compounds in a total volume of 300 µl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 60 min, and were filtered over Whatman GF/B filters under vacuum. Filters were washed three times with 5 ml ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.3). Non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of excess unlabeled PGE2 (10 µM). Binding data fitted to the binding model for a single class of binding sites, using nonlinear regression analysis. IC\n50\n values thus obtained were converted to Ki using the equation of Ki=(IC\n50\n/(1+[L]/K\nD\n) where [L] represents PGE2 concentration (10 nM) and Ko the dissociation constant for [\n3\nH]PGE2 at human EP2 receptors (40 nM).\n\n\n \nRadioligand Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCells Stably Expressing EP\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n, EP\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n, EP\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nand FP Receptors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHEK-293 cells stably expressing the human or feline FP receptor, or EP\n1\n, EP\n2\n, or EP\n4\n receptors were washed with TME buffer, scraped from the bottom of the flasks, and homogenized for 30 sec using a Brinkman PT 10/35 polytron. TME buffer was added to achieve a final 40 ml volume in the centrifuge tubes (the composition of TME is 100 mM TRIS base. 20 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2M EDTA; 10N HCl is added to achieve a pH of 7.4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell homogenate was centrifuged at 19000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4° C using a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in TME buffer to give a final 1 mg/ml protein concentration, as determined by Biorad assay. Radioligand binding competition assays vs. [\n3\nH-]17 -phenyl PGF\n2\nα\n \n (5 nM) were performed in a 100µl volume for 60 min. Binding reactions were started by adding plasma membrane fraction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml ice-cold TRIS-HCl buffer and rapid filtration through glass fiber GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer and oven dried for one hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[\n3\nH-] PGE\n2\n (specific activity 180 Ci mmol) was used as the radioligand for EP receptors. [\n3\nH] 17-phenyl PGF\n2\nα\n \n was employed for FP receptor binding studies. Binding studies employing EP\n1\n, EP\n2\n, EP\n4\n and FP receptors were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. A 200µl assay volume was used. Incubations were for 60 min at 25°C and were terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mM TRIS-HCl, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters and three additional 4 ml washes in a cell harvester (Brandel). Competition studies were performed using a final concentration of 5 nM [\n3\nH]-PGE\n2\n, or 5 nM [\n3\nH] 17-phenyl PGF\n2\nα\n \n and non-specific binding determined with 10\n-5\nM of unlabeled PGE\n2\n, or 17-phenyl PGF\n2\nα\n \n, according to receptor subtype studied.\n\n\n \n\n\nMETHODS FOR FLIPR™ STUDIES\n\n\n\n\n(a) \nCELL CULTURE\n \n\n\n \n \n \nHEK-293(EBNA) cells, stably expressing one type or subtype of recombinant human prostaglandin receptors (prostaglandin receptors expressed: hDP/Gqs5; hEP\n1\n; hEP\n2\n/Gqs5; hEP\n3A\n/Gqi5; hEP\n4\n/Gqs5; hFP; hIP; hTP), were cultured in 100 mm culture dishes in high-glucose DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM I-glutamine, 250 µg/ml geneticin (G418) and 200 µg/ml hygromycin B as selection markers, and 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B.\n\n\n \n(b) \nCALCIUM SIGNAL STUDIES ON THE FLIPR™\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCells were seeded at a density of 5x10\n4\n cells per well in Biocoat® Poly-D-lysine-coated black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates (Becton-Dickinson) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at 37 °C. Cells were then washed two times with HBSS-HEPES buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using a Denley Cellwash plate washer (Labsystems). After 45 minutes of dye-loading in the dark, using the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4 AM at a final concentration of 2 µM, plates were washed four times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye leaving 100 µl in each well. Plates were re-equilibrated to 37 °C for a few minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were excited with an Argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was measured through a 510-570 nm bandwidth emission filter (FLIPR™, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Drug solution was added in a 50 Ul volume to each well to give the desired final concentration. The peak increase in fluorescence intensity was recorded for each well. On each plate, four wells each served as negative (HBSS-HEPES buffer) and positive controls (standard agonists: BW245C (hDP); PGE\n2\n (hEP\n1\n; hEP\n2\n/Gqs5; hEP\n3A\n/Gqi5; hEP\n4\n/Gqs5); PGF\n2α\n (hFP); carbacydin (hIP); U-46619 (hTP), depending on receptor). The peak fluorescence change in each drug-containing well was then expressed relative to the controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds were tested in a high-throughput (HTS) or concentration-response (CoRe) format. In the HTS format, forty-four compounds per plate were examined in duplicates at a concentration of 10\n-5\n M. To generate concentration-response curves, four compounds per plate were tested in duplicates in a concentration range between 10\n-5\n and 10\n-11\n M. The duplicate values were averaged. In either, HTS or CoRe format each compound was tested on at least 3 separate plates using cells from different passages to give an n ≥ 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the binding and activity studies, presented in Tables 1 demonstrate that the compounds disclosed herein are selective prostaglandin EP\n2\n agonists, and are thus useful for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBINDIHG-KI (nM)\n \n \n \nCa\n2+\n Signal-EC50 (nM)\nb\n \n \n \n \n \n \nENTRY\n \n \n \nSTRUCTURE*\n \n \n \nEP2\n \n \n \nEP4\n \n \n \nFP\n \n \n \nEP1\n \n \n \nEP2\n \n \n \nEP3\n \n \n \nEP4\n \n \n \nTP\n \n \n \nIP\n \n \n \nOP\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n43\n \n \n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n62\n\n(5)\n \n8775\n \n>10.000\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n \n \nlow retention time diastereomer\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n70\n \n \n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n25\n\n(9)\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n9057\n \n \n \n \n \nhiqh retention time diastereomer\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n89\n \n \n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n1623\n\n(3)\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n>10.000\n \n4328\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot active\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1051\n \n4207\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n381\n\n(34)\n \n4421\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n401\n \n1030\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n731\n\n(94)\n \n182\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2309\n \n \n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n2506\n\n(73)\n \n3479\n \n> 10.000\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2994\n \n1520\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n7811\n\n(4984)\n \n4343\n \n4899\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n13\n \n \n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n2120\n\n(2)\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot active\n \n \n \nnot active\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n173\n \n1938\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n208 (9)\n \n4552\n \n>10K\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \nnot active\n \n \n \na)\n \nAll compounds are mixtures of diastereomers except where indicated\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nb)\n \nData in parantheses refer to cAMP measurement (see experimental for details)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nIn vitro testing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUnited States Patent Application Serial No. \n \n11/553,143, filed on October 26, 2006\n \n, describes the methods used to obtain the in vitro data in the table below.\n\n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nENTRY\n \n \n \nSTRUCTURE\n \n \n \n \n \nDOG\n \n \n \nMONKEY\n \n \n \nRABBIT\n \n \n \n \n \nConc.

For example, an introductory organic chemistry textbook (\nFrancis A. Carey, Organic Chemistry, New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company 1987, p. 63\n) states \"a wedge indicates a bond coming from the plane of the paper toward the viewer\" and the hatched wedge, indicated as a \"dashed line\", \"represents a bond receding from the viewer.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of inflammatory bowel disease may be accomplished by the administration of the compounds described herein to the suffering mammal. Inflammatory bowel disease describes a variety of diseases characterized by inflammation of the bowels including, but not limited to, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment may be accomplished by oral administration, by suppository, or parenteral administration, or some other suitable method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of the compounds disclosed herein to the colon via oral dosage forms may be accomplished by any of a number of methods known in the art. For example, reviews by \nChourasia and Jain in J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci 6 (1): 33-66, 2003\n and \nShareef et. al (AAPS PharmSci 2003; 5(2) Article (17\n) describe a number of useful methods. These methods include 1) administration of a prodrug, including an azo or a carbohydrate based prodrug; 2) coating the drug with, or encapsulating or impregnating the drug into a polymer designed for delivery to the colon, 3) time released delivery of the drug, 4) use of a bioadhesive system; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile not intending to be bound in any way by theory, it is believed that intestinal microflora are capable of reductive cleavage of an azo bond leaving the two nitrogen atoms as amine functional groups. While not intending to limit the scope of the invention in any way, the azo prodrug approach has been used to deliver to 5-aminosalicylic acid to the colons of humans in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. It is also believed that bacteria of the lower Gl also have enzymes which can digest glycosides, glucuronides, cyclodextrins, dextrans, and other carbohydrates, and ester prodrugs formed from these carbohydrates have been shown to deliver the parent active drugs selectively to the colon. For example, in vivo and in vitro studies on rats and guinea pigs with prodrugs of dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, and fluorocortisone, suggest that glycoside conjugates may be useful for the delivery of steroids to the human colon. Other in vivo studies have suggested that glucouronide, cyclodextrin, and dextran prodrugs of steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are useful for delivery of these drugs to the lower GI tract. An amide of salicylic acid and glutamic acid has been shown to be useful for the delivery of salicylic acid to the colon of rabbit and dog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbohydrate polymers such as amylase, arabinogalactan, chitosan, chondroiton sulfate, dextran, guar gum, pectin, and xylin, or azo-group containing polymers can be used to coat a drug compound, or a drug may be impregnated or encapsulated in the polymer. It is believed that after oral administration, the polymers remain stable in the upper GI tract, but are digested by the microflora of the lower Gl thus releasing the drug for treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymers which are sensitive to pH may also be used since the colon has a higher pH than the upper GI tract. Such polymers are commercially available. For example, Rohm Pharmaceuticals, Darmstadt, Germany, commercially provides pH dependent methacrylate based polymers and copolymers which have varying solubilities over different pH ranges based upon the number of free carboxylate groups in the polymer under the tradename Eudragit®. Several Eudragit® dosage forms are currently used to deliver salsalazine for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Time release systems, bioadhesive systems, and other delivery systems have also been studied."
