Specifically, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders, hematological disorders, eating disorders, obesity, anxiety, depression, diseases associated with pain, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n2A \n& 5-HT\n2C\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nsubtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D. R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situ hybridization studies of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2 \nand CA\n3 \nregions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe high affinity of number of antipsychotic agents towards 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, the localization of its mRNA in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with the said receptor (Ref: Sleight, A. J. et al. (1997) 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nreceptors: molecular biology, functional correlates and possible therapeutic indications, Drug News Perspect 10, 214-224). Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see Reavill C. and Rogers D. C., Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonsma F. J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behavior yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [Stean, T. et al. (1999) Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. Br. J. Pharmacol. 127, 131P; Routledge, C. et al. (2000) Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6\n) receptor antagonist. Br. J. Pharmacol. 130, 1606-1612]. Although this indicates that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur understanding of the roles of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications such as anxiety; although one 5-HT\n6 \nagonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently, the exact role of the receptor is still to be established and is the focus of significant investigation. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M. P.; Lefevre, K.; Miguel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E I Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6 \nselective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist has some positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6 \nligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [Cole, D. C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (August 28-September 1, Washington D.C.), Abstract MEDI 17.]\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication WO 03/066056 A1 reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication WO 03/065046 A2 discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and proposes that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, recent in-vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P; and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, Roth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, pages 1403-1412; Sibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327, Sleight, A. J.; et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5; and Sleight, A. J.; et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-118.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist and 5-HT\n6 \nantisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542); Wooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129; and WO 02/098878.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently a review by Holenz, Jo''rg et. al., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, April 2006, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT\n6 \nligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and to investigate its distribution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far several clinical candidates form the part of indole-type structures and are closely related structurally to the endogenous ligand 5-HT, for example compounds by Glennon, R.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, the following terms used in the specification and claims have the meanings given below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Halogen” means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“(C\n1\n-C\n3\n) alkyl” means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and iso-propyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy” means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy and

trifluoromethyl, trifluoroethyl, fluoroethyl, difluoroethyl and the like;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy” means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes fluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoroethoxy, fluoroethoxy, difluoroethoxy and the like;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkyl” means cyclic or branched cyclic alkyl radicals containing three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkyl methyl or cyclohexyl, which may be substituted or unsubstituted and optionally the substituents may be selected from halogen, (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl or (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy” means cyclic or branched cyclic alkyl radicals containing three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy, cyclopropylmethoxy or cyclohexyloxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “schizophrenia” means schizophrenia, schizophreniform, disorder, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder wherein the term “psychotic” refers to delusions, prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior. See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, the mammal being treated therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Therapeutically effective amount” is defined as ‘an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treating”, “treat” or “treatment” embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stereoisomers” is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e.g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L-mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:\n\n \n \n \ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form.\n \nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (Principles of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316).\n \niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (Jacques et. al., “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution”, Wiley Interscience, 1981).\n \niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nChiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. The present invention includes, within its scope, all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts forming a part of this invention may be prepared by treating the compound of formula (I) with 1-6 equivalents of a base such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium t-butoxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate, calcium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride and the like. Solvents such as water, acetone, ether, THF, methanol, ethanol, t-butanol, dioxane, isopropanol, isopropyl ether or mixtures thereof may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, other salts are included in the invention. They may serve as intermediates in the purification of the compounds, in the preparation of other salts or in the identification and characterization of the compounds or intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be solvated, eg. as the hydrate. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric solvates (example: hydrates) as well as compounds containing variable amounts of solvent (example: water).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises of the following route, wherein the key intermediate is synthesized as described in preparation 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme-I\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process of this invention includes contacting a compound of the following formula (a),\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwith amine derivatives, in presence of inert solvent at ambient temperature to obtain a compound of formula (I), wherein all substitutions are described as earlier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, ethyl acetate, water, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl ether (DME), alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propranol, n-butanol, tert-butanol and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m-, p-xylene and the like or a mixture thereof and preferably using DMF and m-xylene. The inert atmosphere may be maintained by using inert gases such as N\n2\n, Ar or He. The reaction may be affected in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydride and alkali metal hydroxides and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide or mixtures thereof. The reaction can also be conducted in the absence of a base. The reaction temperature may range from 30° C. to 160 based on the choice of solvent and preferably at a temperature in the range from 30° C. to 100° C. The duration of the reaction may range from 1 to 24 hours, preferably from a period of 8 to 14 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds obtained by the above method of preparation of the present invention can be transformed into another compound of this invention by further chemical modifications using well-known reactions such as oxidation, reduction, protection, deprotection, rearrangement reaction, halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation, alkylthiolation, demethylation, O-alkylation, O-acylation, N-alkylation, N-alkenylation, N-acylation, N-cyanation, N-sulfonylation, coupling reaction using transition metals and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf necessary, any one or more than one of the following steps can be carried out,\n\n \n \n \n \n \ni) Converting a compound of the formula (I) into another compound of the formula (I)\n \nii) Removing any protecting groups or\n \niii) Forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or a prodrug thereof.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nProcess (i) may be performed using conventional interconversion procedures such as epimerisation, oxidation, reduction, alkylation, nucleophilic or electrophilic aromatic substitution and ester hydrolysis or amide bond formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn process (ii) examples of protecting groups and the means for their removal can be found in T. W. Greene ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ (J. Wiley and Sons, 1991). Suitable amine protecting groups include sulphonyl (e.g. tosyl), acyl (e.g. acetyl, 2′,2′,2′-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl) and arylalkyl (eg. benzyl), which may be removed by hydrolysis (e.g. using an acid such as hydrochloric or trifluoroacetic acid) or reductively (e.g. hydrogenolysis of a benzyl group or reductive removal of a 2′,2′,2′-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group using zinc in acetic acid) as appropriate. Other suitable amine protecting groups include trifluoroacetyl, which may be removed by base catalysed hydrolysis or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group (Ellman linker), which may be removed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis, for example with trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn process (iii) halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared conventionally by reaction with the appropriate acid or acid derivative as described earlier in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to use the compounds of formula (I) in therapy, they will normally be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate) or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol) and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer or from a capsule using a inhaler or insufflator. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule; it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g., migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or “puff” of aerosol contains 20 μg to 1000 μg of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 μg to 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1, 2 or 3 doses each time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) or their derivatives as defined above can be used to produce a medicament, along with conventional pharmaceutical auxiliaries, carriers and additives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch therapy includes multiple choices: for example, administering two compatible compounds simultaneously in a single dose form or administering each compound individually in a separate dosage or if required at same time interval or separately in order to maximize the beneficial effect or minimize the potential side-effects of the drugs according to the known principles of pharmacology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of the active compounds can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration, age and weight of patient, nature and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. Therefore, any reference herein to a pharmacologically effective amount of the compounds of general formula (I) refers to the aforementioned factors. A proposed dose of the active compounds of this invention, for either oral, parenteral, nasal or buccal administration, to an average adult human, for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is 0.1 to 200 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCommercial reagents were utilized without further purification. Room temperature refers to 25-30° C. IR were taken using KBr and in solid state. Unless otherwise stated, all mass spectra were carried out using ESI conditions. \n1\nH-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz on a Bruker instrument. Deuterated chloroform (99.8% D) was used as solvent. TMS was used as internal reference standard. Chemical shift values are expressed in parts per million (δ) values. The following abbreviations are used for the multiplicity for the NMR signals: s=singlet, bs=broad singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, qui=quintet, h=heptet, dd=double doublet, dt=double triplet, tt=triplet of triplets, m=multiplet.

Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 μg/mL G418 and incubated at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70% confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and 1 μM serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 μM EDTA (2:1) at 4° C. for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4° C. and the supernatants were stored at 4° C. until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 μL, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 mL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hours at 4° C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4° C., the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n7\n.\n\n\n \nExample 51\n\n\nRodent Pharmacokinetic Study\n\n\n \n \n \nMale wistar rats (230-280 grams) obtained from NIN (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree to five animals were housed in each cage.

(National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup allocation Group 1: Vehicle (Water; 5 mL/kg; p.o.), Group 2: NCE (3 mg/kg; p.o.), Group 3: NCE (10 mg/kg; p.o.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgical Procedure: Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and placed in Stereotaxic frame. Guide cannula (CMA/12) was placed at AP: −5.2 mm, ML: +5.0 mm relative from bregma and DV: −3.8 mm from the brain surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1986). While the animal was still anesthetized, a micro dialysis probe (CMA/12, 4 mm, PC) was inserted through the guide cannula and secured in place. After surgery recovery period of 48-72 hours was maintained before subjecting the animal for study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA day prior to study animals were transferred to home cages for acclimatization and implanted probe was perfused overnight with a modified Ringer's solution comprised of 1.3 μM CaCl2 (Sigma), 1.0 μM MgCl\n2 \n(Sigma), 3.0 μM KCl (Sigma), 147.0 μM NaCl (Sigma), 1.0 μM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 0.2 μM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.2H\n2\nO and 0.3 μM neostigmine bromide (Sigma) (pH to 7.2) at a rate of 0.2 μL/minute set by a microinfusion pump (PicoPlus, Harward). On the day of experiment perfusion rate was changed to 1.2 μL/minutes and allowed for 3 hours stabilization. After stabilization period, four basals, were collected at 20 minutes intervals before dosing. Dialysate samples were collected in glass vials using CMA/1.70 refrigerated fraction collector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle or NCE (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered by gavage after four fractions had been collected.

Acetylcholine is quantified in the calibration range of 0.250 to 8.004 ng/mL in dialysates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn completion of the microdialysis experiments, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were removed and stored in a 10% formalin solution. Each brain was sliced at 50μ on a cryostat (Leica) stained and examined microscopically to confirm probe placement. Data from animals with incorrect probe placement were discarded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicrodialysis data were expressed as percent changes (Mean±S.E.M.) of baseline that was defined as the average absolute value (in fM/10 μL) of the four samples before drug administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffects of NCE (3 & 10 mg/kg) and Vehicle treatments were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. In all statistical measures, a p<0.05 was considered significant.

(National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used. The chronic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) on food intake in well-fed rats was then determined as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats were housed in single home cages for 28 days. During this period, the rats were either dosed orally or ip, with a composition comprising a compound of formula (1) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without the said compound (control group), once a day. The rat is provided with ad libitum food and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn 0, 1\nst\n, 7\nth\n, 14\nth\n, 21\nst \nand 28\nth \nday the rats were left with the pre-weighed amounts of food. Food intake and weight gain were measured on a routine basis. Also a food ingestion method is disclosed in the literature (Kask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 414, 2001, 215-224 and Turnball et. al., Diabetes, vol 51, August, 2002, and some in-house modifications.). The respective parts of the descriptions are herein incorporated as a reference and they form part of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome representative compounds have shown the statistically significant decrease in food intake, when conducted in the above manner at the doses of either 10 mg/Kg or 30 mg/Kg or both\n\n\n \nExample 55\n\n\nObject Recognition Task Model\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of this invention were estimated using a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model. Male Wister rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N.I.N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiment was carried out in a 50×50×50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height×5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed. T1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1+a2). T2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3+b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats-Behavioral data, Behav. Brain Res., 31, 47-59.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNORT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nDiscriminative Index (DI) = Treatment (Vehicle)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n10 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n30 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\nInference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\n0.46 (0.52)\n\n\n0.58 (0.56)\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31.\n\n\n0.54 (0.48)\n\n\n0.52 (0.52)\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 56\n\n\nWater Maze\n\n\n \n \n \nThe water maze apparatus consisted of a circular pool (1.8 m diameter, 0.6 m high) constructed in black Perspex (TSE systems, Germany) filled with water (24±2° C.) and positioned underneath a wide-angled video camera to track animal. The 10 cm\n2 \nperspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber\n\n\nScopolamine Induced Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.\n\n\n ≧3 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31.\n\n\n≧30 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 57\n\n\nChewing/Yawning/Stretching Induction by 5-HT\n6 \nR Antagonists\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) King M. V., Sleight A., J., Woolley M.

The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\n \nExperimental Procedure:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually <20 seconds) and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 seconds was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 seconds was employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) Callahan P.
