Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims priority to U.S. \nprovisional application\n 60/782,708, filed Mar. 15, 2006, which is incorporated by reference to the extent not inconsistent with the disclosure herewith.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERAL FUNDING\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention was made with U.S. Government support under Grant number R01AI064611 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) was characterized as a disease associated with staphylococci infection over 25 years ago. Subsequently, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) from \nStaphylococcus aureus \nwas identified as the protein responsible for the disease in most cases. TSST-1 is a member of a family of molecules secreted by \nS. aureus \nand \nStreptococcus pyogenes \nthat cause elevated systemic cytokine levels, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), leading to fever, TSS, and ultimately organ failure. The term superantigen (SAg) was given to this class of molecules because these toxins stimulate a large fraction of T cells bearing the same variable regions of the T cell receptor beta chain (Vβ regions). As up to 20% of the T cell repertoire can bear the same Vβ region, SAgs are capable of stimulating thousands of times more T cells than conventional antigens. Since soluble monovalent ligands for the T cell receptor (TCR) cannot themselves stimulate T cells, SAgs act by cell-to-cell cross-linking TCRs and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen presenting cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bacterial SAg family now contains over 20 members, including the \nS. aureus \nenterotoxins TSST-1, (SE) A to E, and G to Q and the \nS. pyogenes \nexotoxins A (Spe) A, C, G to M, and the mitogenic exotoxins called SMEZ. Sequence based phylogenetic relationships among these toxins indicated that they represent five groups, in which one group contains TSST-1 as the only known member. The structures of SAgs, including TSST-1, have been shown to be very similar. A smaller N-terminal domain contains two β-sheets and a larger C-terminal domain consists of a central α-helix and a five-stranded β-sheet. Although all bacterial SAgs share a common three-dimensional structure, they exhibit diversity in their specificities for TCR Vβ domains and class II MHC molecules, as well as in the molecular architecture of the respective MHC-SAg-TCR signaling complexes that they form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese superantigens cause many diseases, including pneumonia, mastitis, phlebitis, meningitis, urinary tract infections; osteomyelitis, endocarditis, nosocomial infection, staphylococcal food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. Current treatments include supportive care, antibiotics, and intraveneous immune globulin. There are several strains of \nS. aureus \nthat are antibiotic resistant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStaphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), one of the more thoroughly characterized SAgs, has been considered a potential biological weapon due to its toxicity and to previous programs involving large-scale production and aerosolization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the fact that the molecular interactions of these toxins have been well-characterized, therapeutics capable of neutralizing their activity are not available for clinical use. There is a need in the art for a therapeutic agent to treat superantigen-mediated disease.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided are methods for making a stabilized T cell receptor variable region, comprising: (a) cloning the T cell receptor variable region gene in a yeast display vector; (b) mutagenizing the T cell receptor variable region to generate a library of mutants; and (c) selecting the mutants which have the highest binding affinity to a ligand.

In one embodiment, the mutant and ligand bind with an equilibrium binding constant K\nD\n<1 nM. All individual values and intermediate ranges of equilibrium binding constants less than 100 μM are included herein, including specifically for the purpose of use in the claims to exclude prior art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a soluble mutant T cell receptor (TCR) variable region having higher affinity than the wild type T cell receptor variable region for a bacterial superantigen, wherein said T cell receptor variable region is a mutant T cell receptor variable region carrying one or more mutations in a TCR variable region. In one embodiment, the TCR variable region exhibits an equilibrium binding constant K\nD \nfor the bacterial superantigen of between about 10\n−8\nM and 10\n−12\nM. In one embodiment, the TCR variable region is a mutant TCR having one or more mutations in a CDR.

In one embodiment, the variable region is selected from Seq. ID Nos. 16-22; 30-44; and 66-73.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method for treating \nstaphylococcus \ninfection in a mammal, the method comprising: providing an effective amount of a high affinity mutant TCR variable region having one or more mutations in the TCR variable beta region, which TCR variable region binds to the superantigen with higher affinity than wild type TCR variable region, wherein the high affinity TCR variable region interferes with the binding of the superantigen to the MHC class II molecules and T cell receptors of the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of treating a disease state in a mammal caused by a bacterial superantigen comprising: administering an effective amount of a high affinity mutant of the T cell receptor variable region to a mammal. In one embodiment, the mammal is a human. In one embodiment, the variable region is a variable beta region. In one embodiment, the disease is selected from the group consisting of: pneumonia, mastitis, phlebitis, meningitis, urinary tract infections; osteomyelitis, endocarditis, nosocomial infection, staphylococcal food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. In one embodiment, the T cell receptor variable region is selected from Seq. ID Nos. 16-22; 30-44; and 66-73.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a therapeutic composition comprising a stabilized T cell receptor variable region and optional pharmaceutical additives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided are compositions comprising soluble protein domains of the T cell receptor variable region that have high-affinity for a ligand, and methods for preparation thereof. In one embodiment, the ligand is a superantigen. The compositions bind to the active site of the superantigen and prevent or decrease the normal effect of the superantigen. These compositions are useful as therapeutics for those animals, including mammals, including humans, which are affected by a disease caused by the superantigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention are prepared and selected using yeast display techniques described in detail elsewhere. Generally, a library of mutants of the protein of interest are displayed on yeast cells and labeled with fluorescently labeled antibodies. The library is screened and those yeast cells displaying mutants which bind to the desired ligand with higher affinity are selected. The selected mutants can be mutagenized and screened for as many rounds as desired or required to provide the mutant with a desired affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegions and positions for site-directed mutagenesis of the T cell receptor variable region may be determined by selecting portions of the T cell receptor variable region that are believed to contact the superantigen (“contact regions”). These contact regions can be determined by structural models or calculations, as known in the art. For the systems described herein, the contact regions are primarily in the CDR2 and framework (FR) regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions described herein are about 12,000 daltons, although larger or smaller compositions are included in this invention and prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “stabilized” protein means the protein is displayable on yeast. As shown previously, wild type single-chain T cell receptor domains are not displayable on yeast, and require at least one mutation to display the properly folded protein. (PNAS 96:5651 (1999); J. Mol. Biol. 292:949 (1999); Nature Biotech. 18:754 (2000)). The mutation may be in any region or regions of the variable domain that results in a stabilized protein. In one embodiment, one or more mutations is in one or more of CDR1, CDR2, HV4, CDR3, FR2, and FR3. The regions used for mutagenesis can be determined by directed evolution, where crystal structures or molecular models are used to generate regions of the TCR which interact with the ligand of interest (toxin or antigen, for example). In other examples, the variable region can be reshaped, by adding or deleting amino acids to engineer a desired interaction between the variable region and the ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe yeast display cloning vector used in these experiments can be any vector which allows insertion of the mutated protein and display on yeast. One particular example of a yeast display cloning vector is pCT202, which is shown in \nFIG. 1C\n. The use of this vector has been described previously. The mutations that allow surface display also yield thermally stable, soluble variable region domains that can be secreted from yeast.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention provides a method for making stabilized T cell receptor (TCR) variable domains. These stabilized TCR variable domains are useful as receptor antagonists for ligands such as SEB, TSST-1, and SEC3. The methodology exemplified in the examples can be used to make stabilized TCR variable domains for any antigen. The terms “variable region” and “variable domain” are used interchangeably.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, stabilized proteins for TSST-1 are hVβ2.1 regions with one or more of the mutations S88G, R10M, A13V, L72P, and R113Q. In one embodiment, neutralizing agents for TSST-1 include those clones having the sequences exemplified with designations C4, C8, C10, D9, D10, D19, and D20 in \nFIG. 2\n. In one embodiment, neutralizing agents for TSST-1 have more than 5000 times increase in affinity for the toxin than the wild type. In one embodiment, stabilized proteins for SEB are mVβ8.2 regions with the mutation G17E and optionally one or more mutations selected from the group consisting of: N24K, G42E, H47F, Y48M, Y50H, A52I, G53R, S54N, and T55V. In one embodiment, neutralizing agents for SEB include those clones having the sequences exemplified with designations G5-x (x=3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15) in \nFIG. 23\n. In one embodiment, neutralizing agents for SEB have more than 5000 times increase in affinity for the toxin than the wild type. All variable region sequences that are stabilized are individually included in this disclosure. All variable region sequences given here that have higher affinity for a ligand than a wild type sequence are individually included in this disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic products can be made using the materials shown herein. Effective amounts of therapeutic products are the minimum dose that produces a measurable effect in a subject. Therapeutic products are easily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the variable domain is administered directly to a patient. In one embodiment, the variable domain is linked to an immunoglobulin constant region and used as a therapeutic. This embodiment extends the lifetime of the variable domain in the serum. In one embodiment, the variable domain is linked to PEG, as known in the art. This embodiment lengthens the serum clearance. These methods and other methods of administering, such as intravenously, are known in the art. Useful dosages are easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutagenesis methods used here include the use of mutator strains of \nE. coli\n, error-prone PCR, site-directed mutagenesis with degenerate primers/PCR, DNA shuffling, and other methods known in the art. Cloning methods used include standard ligations and electroporation, and homologous recombination of PCR products. Library sizes of up to 10\n7 \nmolecules, for example, are formed. One method of analysis, fluorescent-activated cell sorting has been described previously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods for making neutralizing agents described herein, a stabilized T cell receptor variable region is used as the starting material for additional rounds of mutations and sorting. This process gives neutralizing agents with increasingly higher affinity to a toxin or antigen of interest. As used herein, “neutralizing agent” is a protein or protein fragment which binds to a molecule of interest with greater affinity than a wild type protein or protein fragment and is also referred to as “high affinity.” In one embodiment, the neutralizing agent has an affinity for the molecule of interest of more 5,000 times that of the wild type. In one embodiment, the neutralizing agent has an affinity for the molecule of interest of more 10,000 times that of the wild type. In one embodiment, the neutralizing agent has an affinity for the molecule of interest of more than 100,000 times that of wild type. Herein, the usage of the terms dissociation constant and equilibrium binding constant are consistent with the usage in the art and the context given.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the figures and tables which present amino acid sequences, the wild type is designated “WT”. In the sequences presented below the top sequence, a dash indicates the amino acid is the same as the top sequence. A letter indicates a substitution has been made in that position from the top sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, administration of an effective amount of a neutralizing agent is useful in preventing or reducing the toxic effects of a bacterial superantigen. In one embodiment of the invention, administration of an effective amount of a neutralizing agent prevents or reduces the binding of a bacterial superantigen to the variable region. In one embodiment of the invention, administration of an effective amount of a neutralizing agent prevents or reduces the crosslinking of the variable region and MHC.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n.

Applicant does not wish to be bound by any theory presented here. The generation of high affinity T cell receptor variable regions for exemplary ligands, including TSST-1 and SEB, are demonstrated here. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to produce high affinity T cell receptor variable regions for other superantigens and other ligands using the methods described here and methods known in the art without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given to such terms, the following definitions are provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA coding sequence is the part of a gene or cDNA which codes for the amino acid sequence of a protein, or for a functional RNA such as a tRNA or rRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplement or complementary sequence means a sequence of nucleotides which forms a hydrogen-bonded duplex with another sequence of nucleotides according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. For example, the complementary base sequence for 5′-AAGGCT-3′ is 3′-TTCCGA-5′.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDownstream means on the 3′ side of any site in DNA or RNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression refers to the transcription of a gene into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) and subsequent translation of a mRNA into a protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn amino acid sequence that is functionally equivalent to a specifically exemplified TCR sequence is an amino acid sequence that has been modified by single or multiple amino acid substitutions, by addition and/or deletion of amino acids, or where one or more amino acids have been chemically modified, but which nevertheless retains the binding specificity and high affinity binding activity of a cell-bound or a soluble TCR protein of the present invention. Functionally equivalent nucleotide sequences are those that encode polypeptides having substantially the same biological activity as a specifically exemplified cell-bound or soluble TCR protein. In the context of the present invention, a soluble TCR protein lacks the portions of a native cell-bound TCR and is stable in solution (i.e., it does not generally aggregate in solution when handled as described herein and under standard conditions for protein solutions).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo nucleic acid sequences are heterologous to one another if the sequences are derived from separate organisms, whether or not such organisms are of different species, as long as the sequences do not naturally occur together in the same arrangement in the same organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomology refers to the extent of identity between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolated means altered by the hand of man from the natural state. If an “isolated” composition or substance occurs in nature, it has been changed or removed from its original environment, or both. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is isolated, as the term is employed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker region is an amino acid sequence that operably links two functional or structural domains of a protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid construct is a nucleic acid molecule which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or which has been modified to contain segments of nucleic acid which are combined and juxtaposed in a manner which would not otherwise exist in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecule means a single- or double-stranded linear polynucleotide containing either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides that are linked by 3′-5′-phosphodiester bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo DNA sequences are operably linked if the nature of the linkage does not interfere with the ability of the sequences to effect their normal functions relative to each other. For instance, a promoter region would be operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter were capable of effecting transcription of that coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polypeptide is a linear polymer of amino acids that are linked by peptide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter means a cis-acting DNA sequence, generally 80-120 base pairs long and located upstream of the initiation site of a gene, to which RNA polymerase may bind and initiate correct transcription. There can be associated additional transcription regulatory sequences which provide on/off regulation of transcription and/or which enhance (increase) expression of the downstream coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recombinant nucleic acid molecule, for instance a recombinant DNA molecule, is a novel nucleic acid sequence formed in vitro through the ligation of two or more nonhomologous DNA molecules (for example a recombinant plasmid containing one or more inserts of foreign DNA cloned into at least one cloning site).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means the directed modification of the genome of a cell by the external application of purified recombinant DNA from another cell of different genotype, leading to its uptake and integration into the subject cell=s genome. In bacteria, the recombinant DNA is not typically integrated into the bacterial chromosome, but instead replicates autonomously as a plasmid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpstream means on the 5′ side of any site in DNA or RNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector is a nucleic acid molecule that is able to replicate autonomously in a host cell and can accept foreign DNA. A vector carries its own origin of replication, one or more unique recognition sites for restriction endonucleases which can be used for the insertion of foreign DNA, and usually selectable markers such as genes coding for antibiotic resistance, and often recognition sequences (e.g. promoter) for the expression of the inserted DNA. Common vectors include plasmid vectors and phage vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh affinity T cell receptor (TCR) means an engineered TCR with stronger binding to a target ligand than the wild type TCR. Some examples of high affinity include an equilibrium binding constant for a bacterial superantigen of between about 10\n−8 \nM and 10\n−12 \nM and all individual values and ranges therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, numerous functionally equivalent nucleotide sequences encode the same amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, those of skill in the art, through standard mutagenesis techniques, in conjunction with the assays described herein, can obtain altered TCR sequences and test them for the expression of polypeptides having particular binding affinity. Useful mutagenesis techniques known in the art include, without limitation, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, region-specific mutagenesis, linker-scanning mutagenesis, and site-directed mutagenesis by PCR [see e.g. Sambrook et al. (1989) and Ausubel et al. (1999)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn obtaining variant TCR coding sequences, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that TCR-derived proteins may be modified by certain amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, and post-translational modifications, without loss or reduction of biological activity. In particular, it is well-known that conservative amino acid substitutions, that is, substitution of one amino acid for another amino acid of similar size, charge, polarity and conformation, are unlikely to significantly alter protein function. The 20 standard amino acids that are the constituents of proteins can be broadly categorized into four groups of conservative amino acids as follows: the nonpolar (hydrophobic) group includes alanine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, tryptophan and valine; the polar (uncharged, neutral) group includes asparagine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, serine, threonine and tyrosine; the positively charged (basic) group contains arginine, histidine and lysine; and the negatively charged (acidic) group contains aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Substitution in a protein of one amino acid for another within the same group is unlikely to have an adverse effect on the biological activity of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomology between nucleotide sequences can be determined by DNA hybridization analysis, wherein the stability of the double-stranded DNA hybrid is dependent on the extent of base pairing that occurs. Conditions of high temperature and/or low salt content reduce the stability of the hybrid, and can be varied to prevent annealing of sequences having less than a selected degree of homology. For instance, for sequences with about 55% G-C content, hybridization and wash conditions of 40-50° C., 6×SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer) and 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) indicate about 60-70% homology, hybridization and wash conditions of 50-65° C., 1×SSC and 0.1% SDS indicate about 82-97% homology, and hybridization and wash conditions of 52° C., 0.1×SSC and 0.1% SDS indicate about 99-100% homology. A wide range of computer programs for comparing nucleotide and amino acid sequences (and measuring the degree of homology) are also available, and a list providing sources of both commercially available and free software is found in Ausubel et al. (1999). Readily available sequence comparison and multiple sequence alignment algorithms are, respectively, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1997) and ClustalW programs. BLAST is available on the Internet at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and a version of ClustalW is available at http://www2.ebi.ac.uk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndustrial strains of microorganisms (e.g., \nAspergillus niger, Aspergillus ficuum, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus oryzae, Trichoderma reesei, Mucor miehei, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis \nor \nBacillus lichenifomis\n) or plant species (e.g., canola, soybean, corn, potato, barley, rye, wheat) may be used as host cells for the recombinant production of the TCR peptides. As the first step in the heterologous expression of a high affinity TCR protein or soluble protein, an expression construct is assembled to include the TCR or soluble TCR coding sequence and control sequences such as promoters, enhancers and terminators. Other sequences such as signal sequences and selectable markers may also be included. To achieve extracellular expression of the scTCR, the expression construct may include a secretory signal sequence. The signal sequence is not included on the expression construct if cytoplasmic expression is desired. The promoter and signal sequence are functional in the host cell and provide for expression and secretion of the TCR or soluble TCR protein. Transcriptional terminators are included to ensure efficient transcription. Ancillary sequences enhancing expression or protein purification may also be included in the expression construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious promoters (transcriptional initiation regulatory region) may be used according to the invention. The selection of the appropriate promoter is dependent upon the proposed expression host. Promoters from heterologous sources may be used as long as they are functional in the chosen host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter selection is also dependent upon the desired efficiency and level of peptide or protein production. Inducible promoters such as tac are often employed in order to dramatically increase the level of protein expression in \nE. coli\n. Overexpression of proteins may be harmful to the host cells. Consequently, host cell growth may be limited. The use of inducible promoter systems allows the host cells to be cultivated to acceptable densities prior to induction of gene expression, thereby facilitating higher product yields.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious signal sequences may be used according to the invention. A signal sequence which is homologous to the TCR coding sequence may be used. Alternatively, a signal sequence which has been selected or designed for efficient secretion and processing in the expression host may also be used. For example, suitable signal sequence/host cell pairs include the \nB. subtilis \nsacB signal sequence for secretion in \nB. subtilis\n, and the \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nα-mating factor or \nP. pastoris \nacid phosphatase phol signal sequences for \nP. pastoris \nsecretion. The signal sequence may be joined directly through the sequence encoding the signal peptidase cleavage site to the protein coding sequence, or through a short nucleotide bridge consisting of usually fewer than ten codons, where the bridge ensures correct reading frame of the downstream TCR sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElements for enhancing transcription and translation have been identified for eukaryotic protein expression systems. For example, positioning the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) \npromoter\n 1000 bp on either side of a heterologous promoter may elevate transcriptional levels by 10- to 400-fold in plant cells. The expression construct should also include the appropriate translational initiation sequences. Modification of the expression construct to include a Kozak consensus sequence for proper translational initiation may increase the level of translation by 10 fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA selective marker is often employed, which may be part of the expression construct or separate from it (e.g., carried by the expression vector), so that the marker may integrate at a site different from the gene of interest. Examples include markers that confer resistance to antibiotics (e.g., bla confers resistance to ampicillin for \nE. coli \nhost cells, nptII confers kanamycin resistance to a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells) or that permit the host to grow on minimal medium (e.g., HIS4 enables \nP. pastoris \nor His\n−\n \n S. cerevisiae \nto grow in the absence of histidine). The selectable marker has its own transcriptional and translational initiation and termination regulatory regions to allow for independent expression of the marker. If antibiotic resistance is employed as a marker, the concentration of the antibiotic for selection will vary depending upon the antibiotic, generally ranging from 10 to 600 μg of the antibiotic/mL of medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression construct is assembled by employing known recombinant DNA techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989; Ausubel et al., 1999). Restriction enzyme digestion and ligation are the basic steps employed to join two fragments of DNA. The ends of the DNA fragment may require modification prior to ligation, and this may be accomplished by filling in overhangs, deleting terminal portions of the fragment(s) with nucleases (e.g., ExoIII), site directed mutagenesis, or by adding new base pairs by PCR. Polylinkers and adaptors may be employed to facilitate joining of selected fragments. The expression construct is typically assembled in stages employing rounds of restriction, ligation, and transformation of \nE. coli\n. Numerous cloning vectors suitable for construction of the expression construct are known in the art (λZAP and pBLUESCRIPT SK-1, Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.; pET, Novagen Inc., Madison, Wis.—cited in Ausubel et al., 1999) and the particular choice is not critical to the invention. The selection of cloning vector will be influenced by the gene transfer system selected for introduction of the expression construct into the host cell. At the end of each stage, the resulting construct may be analyzed by restriction, DNA sequence, hybridization and PCR analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression construct may be transformed into the host as the cloning vector construct, either linear or circular, or may be removed from the cloning vector and used as is or introduced onto a delivery vector. The delivery vector facilitates the introduction and maintenance of the expression construct in the selected host cell type. The expression construct is introduced into the host cells by any of a number of known gene transfer systems (e.g., natural competence, chemically mediated transformation, protoplast transformation, electroporation, biolistic transformation, transfection, or conjugation) (Ausubel et al., 1999; Sambrook et al., 1989). The gene transfer system selected depends upon the host cells and vector systems used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, the expression construct can be introduced into \nS. cerevisiae \ncells by protoplast transformation or electroporation. Electroporation of \nS. cerevisiae \nis readily accomplished, and yields transformation efficiencies comparable to spheroplast transformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, preferably monoclonal, specifically reacting with a TCR protein at a site other than the ligand binding site may be made by methods known in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories; Goding (1986) \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, \n2d ed., Academic Press, New York; and Ausubel et al. (1999) \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh affinity TCR proteins in cell-bound or soluble form which are specific for a particular superantigen are useful, for example, as diagnostic probes for screening biological samples (such as cells, tissue samples, biopsy material, bodily fluids and the like) or for detecting the presence of the superantigen in a test sample. Frequently, the high affinity TCR proteins are labeled by joining, either covalently or noncovalently, a substance which provides a detectable signal. Suitable labels include but are not limited to radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent agents, chemiluminescent agents, magnetic particles and the like. Additionally the TCR protein can be coupled to a ligand for a second binding molecules: for example, the TCR protein can be biotinylated. Detection of the TCR bound to a target cell or molecule can then be effected by binding of a detectable streptavidin (a streptavidin to which a fluorescent, radioactive, chemiluminescent, or other detectable molecule is attached or to which an enzyme for which there is a chromophoric substrate available). U.S. patents describing the use of such labels and/or toxic compounds to be covalently bound to the scTCR protein include but are not limited to Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,927,193; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; 4,331,647; 4,348,376; 4,361,544; 4,468,457; 4,444,744; 4,640,561; 4,366,241; RE 35,500; 5,299,253; 5,101,827; 5,059,413. Labeled TCR proteins can be detected using a monitoring device or method appropriate to the label used. Fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence activated cell sorting can be used where the label is a fluorescent moiety, and where the label is a radionuclide, gamma counting, autoradiography or liquid scintillation counting, for example, can be used with the proviso that the method is appropriate to the sample being analyzed and the radionuclide used. In addition, there can be secondary detection molecules or particle employed where there is a detectable molecule or particle which recognized the portion of the TCR protein which is not part of the binding site for the superantigen or other ligand in the absence of a MHC component as noted herein. The art knows useful compounds for diagnostic imaging in situ; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,101,827; 5,059,413.

Toxins include diphtheria toxin, ricin and castor bean toxin, among others, with the proviso that once the TCR-toxin complex is bound to the cell, the toxic moiety is internalized so that it can exert its cytotoxic effect.

They can be typically prepared as injectables, especially for intravenous, intraperitoneal or synovial administration (with the route determined by the particular disease) or as formulations for intranasal or oral administration, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection or other administration may also be prepared. The preparation may also, for example, be emulsified, or the protein(s)/peptide(s) encapsulated in liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredients are often mixed with optional pharmaceutical additives such as excipients or carriers which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof. The concentration of the TCR variable region in injectable, aerosol or nasal formulations is usually in the range of 0.05 to 5 mg/ml. The selection of the particular effective dosages is known and performed without undue experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art. Similar dosages can be administered to other mucosal surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, if desired, vaccines may contain minor amounts of pharmaceutical additives such as auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, and/or adjuvants which enhance the effectiveness of the vaccine. Examples of adjuvants which may be effective include but are not limited to: aluminum hydroxide; N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP); N-acetyl-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (CGP 11637, referred to as nor-MDP); N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(1′-2′-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine (CGP 19835A, referred to as MTP-PE); and RIBI, which contains three components extracted from bacteria: monophosphoryl lipid A, trehalose dimycolate and cell wall skeleton (MPL+TDM+CWS) in a 2% squalene/\nTween\n 80 emulsion.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to the acid addition salts (formed with free amino groups of the peptide) which are formed with inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acids; and organic acids, e.g., acetic, oxalic, tartaric, or maleic acid. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups may also be derived from inorganic bases, e.g., sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and organic bases, e.g., isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino-ethanol, histidine, and procaine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTCR variable regions for therapeutic use are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount and manner as are prophylactically and/or therapeutically effective, according to what is known to the art. The quantity to be administered, which is generally in the range of about 100 to 20,000 μg of protein per dose, more generally in the range of about 1000 to 10,000 μg of protein per dose. Similar compositions can be administered in similar ways using labeled TCR variable regions for use in imaging, for example, to detect cells to which a superantigen is bound. Precise amounts of the active ingredient required to be administered may depend on the judgment of the physician or veterinarian and may be peculiar to each individual, but such a determination is within the skill of such a practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vaccine or other immunogenic composition may be given in a single dose; two dose schedule, for example two to eight weeks apart; or a multiple dose schedule. A multiple dose schedule is one in which a primary course of vaccination may include 1 to 10 or more separate doses, followed by other doses administered at subsequent time intervals as required to maintain and/or reinforce the immune response, e.g., at 1 to 4 months for a second dose, and if needed, a subsequent dose(s) after several months.

The structure of hVβ2.1 in complex with SpeC showed that hVβ2.1 uses a greater number of hypervariable regions for contact, compared to the interaction of mouse Vβ8.2 with its three different SAg ligands. Thus, residues from all three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and hypervariable loop 4 (HV4) contributed contacts with SpeC and the interface exhibited a greater buried surface area than mVβ8.2-SAg interfaces. While the structure of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 complex has not been solved, a recent alanine mutagenesis study of TSST-1 revealed the key residues of TSST-1 that are involved in the interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYeast display techniques were used to engineer the TCR for higher affinity binding to the desired superantigen. These yeast display techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,759,243; 6,696,251; 6,423,538; 6,300,065; 6,699,658, which are incorporated by reference to the extent not inconsistent with the disclosure herewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious studies showed that single chain TCRs (Vβ-linker-Vα) or Vβ domains required mutations to display the properly folded proteins, as a fusion to the agglutinin receptor Aga2, on the surface of yeast. Subsequent studies showed that mutations that enabled surface display also yielded thermally stabilized, soluble V region domains that could be secreted from yeast or refolded from \nEscherichia coli \ninclusion bodies (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fusion of genes encoding Aga2, a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, hVβ2.1, and a c-myc epitope tag (\nFIG. 1(\n \na\n)) was cloned into the yeast display vector shown in \nFIG. 1C\n. As anticipated, the wild-type hVβ2.1 region was not detected on the surface, as probed with a monoclonal antibody to this specific V region (\nFIG. 1(\n \nb\n)) or with an antibody to the C-terminal c-myc tag (data not shown). To identify a mutated hVβ2.1 domain variant that could be displayed on the yeast surface and that would allow expression in \nE. coli\n, the hVβ2.1 insert was subjected to error-prone PCR at an error rate resulting in an average of two mutations per Vβ molecule. PCR products were cloned by homologous recombination into the yeast display plasmid resulting in a library size of approximately 15×10\n6 \ntransformants. The library was selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with an anti-hV β2 antibody through three rounds and an anti-c-myc antibody for one round. After the final round of selection, yeast cells were plated and individual clones were screened for binding to the hVβ2-specific antibody. \nFIG. 1(\n \nb\n) shows an example of the improvement in surface display for one of the clones, EP-8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTen clones (designated EP-series) with the highest levels of surface hVβ2.1, as judged with an anti-hVβ2 antibody, were chosen for sequence analysis. Seven unique sequences, with two or three mutations each, were identified (\nFIG. 2\n). Two of the mutations were present in the CDRs, one was present in HV4, and five mutations were present in FR regions. One of the FR mutations in particular, S88G, was the most prevalent of the mutations isolated, as it was found in six of the seven unique clones. Five of these mutations (R10M, A13V, L72P, S88G and R113Q) accumulated in almost every clone isolated after subsequent rounds of affinity maturation (see below), suggesting that these mutations were each important in stabilization and display. Four of the mutations are located at the Vβ surface, where the constant region (Cβ) would be located in the wild-type T cell receptor (\nFIG. 9(\n \na\n), below). In full length β chains, this area is buried at the Vβ:Cβ interface and thus these mutations may act to prevent aggregation of the Vβ domain. The other mutation, L72P, is located at the other end of the Vβ region within the HV4 loop. The proline substitution may act to stabilize the local region surrounding this loop.\n\n\n \n \nIsolation and Characterization of First Generation High Affinity hVβ2.1 Mutants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe low affinity of hVβ2.1 for TSST-1 (K\nD\n=2.3 μM) prohibits the effective use of the soluble Vβ receptor as an antagonist for TSST-1-mediated toxicity. To engineer higher affinity mutants, the stabilized Vβ genes (EP-series, see above) were used as a starting point for affinity maturation. Because there is no crystal structure of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 complex, the positions for site-directed mutagenesis were based on the structures of other Vβ-SAg complexes. As CDR2 is uniformly involved in contacts with SAgs, including the interaction between hVβ2.1 and SpeC, this region was chosen for the first round of affinity maturation. Five residues in this loop (50, 51, 52, 52a, and 53) were mutated randomly using degenerate oligonucleotides in splice extension PCR reactions with equal amounts of six unique stabilized clones isolated from the error-prone library as templates (see \nFIG. 2\n). The library of approximately 14×10\n6 \nindependent clones was sorted through four cycles using decreasing concentrations of TSST-1. The first and second sorts were performed at a TSST-1 concentration of 1.8 μM (approximately equivalent to the K\nD \nvalue of the wild-type hVβ2.1-TSST-1 interaction), the third sort was performed at 900 nM TSST-1, and the fourth sort was performed at 90 nM TSST-1 (approximately 20-fold below the K\nD \nvalue). Twenty-four clones (designated R-series) were analyzed by flow cytometry for their ability to bind to 200 nM TSST-1, approximately tenfold below the K\nD \nvalue of the wild-type. At this TSST-1 concentration, the stabilized clone EP-8 is weakly positive (a slight shift of the flow histogram) and the affinity matured clone R9 was strongly positive (\nFIG. 3(\n \na\n)). Using the mean fluorescence units of each histogram, each of the 24 clones was compared to the stabilized clone EP-8 and all clones demonstrated an improvement over the stabilized mutant (\nFIG. 3(\n \nb\n)), which has an affinity similar to the wild-type hVβ2.1, as measured by surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis (see below and Table 1). Fifteen clones isolated from the first affinity maturation library were sequenced to examine the mutations in the CDR2 loop (\nFIG. 2\n, and data not shown). Each of the clones sequenced was unique and contained a sequence that differed from the wild-type CDR2 of hVβ2.1. While there did not appear to be a strict consensus of any of the residues, there were strong preferences for either histidine or arginine at position 50 (from asparagine) and a histidine at position 53 (from lysine). There were also preferences for either aspartic acid or the wild-type glycine at position 52 and an aromatic residue at \nposition\n 52a. Retention of the wild-type glycine at position 52 in many clones suggests that this residue may contribute the flexibility required for positioning other residues in this loop. While CDR2 of the wild-type hVβ2.1 contains two potentially charged residues (Glu51 and Lys53) and a net neutral charge, most of the mutated CDR2 regions were highly charged with a net positive charge. The exception was clone R17 that retained a net neutral charge (see below). The preference for an aromatic residue at \nposition\n 52a may also indicate a hydrophobic interaction facilitates binding to TSST-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKinetic and affinity parameters for the interactions\n \n \n \nbetween hVβ2.1 variants and TSST-1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n \nk\nd \n(s\n−1\n)\n \nK\nA \n(M\n−1\n)\n \nK\nD \n(M)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEP-8\na\n \n \nn.d.\nb\n \n \nn.d.\n \n1.67 × 10\n8\n \n \n5.99 × 10\n−7\n \n \n \n \nR9\n \n1.48 (±0.01) × 10\n4\n \n \n1.86 (±0.02) × 10\n−3\n \n \n7.95 × 10\n7\n \n \n1.26 × 10\n−8\n \n \n \n \nC10 (Y56A)\n \n5.87 (±0.05) × 10\n4\n \n \n3.99 (±0.02) × 10\n−3\n \n \n1.47 × 10\n7\n \n \n6.78 × 10\n−8\n \n \n \n \nC10 (K62A)\n \n2.14 (±0.01) × 10\n5\n \n \n3.24 (±0.02) × 10\n−4\n \n \n6.60 × 10\n8\n \n \n1.52 × 10\n−9\n \n \n \n \nC10\n \n3.28 (±0.01) × 10\n6\n \n \n1.12 (±0.02) × 10\n−4\n \n \n2.94 × 10\n9\n \n \n \n \n3.41 × 10\n−10\n \n \n \n \nD10\n \n2.56 (±0.01) × 10\n3\n \n \n4.59 (±0.02) × 10\n−3\n \n \n5.58 × 10\n8\n \n \n \n \n1.79 × 10\n−20\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeasured by surface plasmon resonance with TSST-1 immobilized on chips.\n \n \n \n \na\nAffinity parameters determined by equilibrium binding studies\n \n \n \n \nb\nn.d. not determined.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nIsolation and Characterization of Second Generation High Affinity hVβ2.1 Mutants\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTitration of the yeast-displayed mutant R9 with various concentrations of TSST-1 yielded an estimated binding affinity of 6 nM (\nFIG. 3(\n \nb\n), inset). To generate hVβ2.1 mutants with sub-nanomolar affinity, three of the first generation mutants (R9, R17 and R18) were used as templates for the generation of additional mutated libraries. These clones were selected on the basis of their high affinity binding to TSST-1, as well as having distinctly different CDR2 sequences (\nFIG. 2)\n. As hVβ2.1 binding to SpeC involves contacts with HV4 and CDR1, it was reasoned that hVβ2.1 might also use these regions for binding to TSST-1. Thus, separate libraries in CDR1 (\nresidues\n 27, 27a, 28, 29, 30), HV4 (\nresidues\n 68, 69, 70, 71, 72), and an additional library in the CDR2 loop (\n \n \nresidues\n \n \n 52a, 53, 54, 55, 56) were generated to extend the range of residues that were mutated. These three libraries were pooled in equal ratios for flow cytometric sorting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the initial flow cytometry experiment determined the K\nD \nvalue of hVβ2.1 mutant R9 to be about 6 nM, a selection strategy other than an equilibrium-based methodology was required because at this concentration, the number of surface displayed receptors, in a library of 10\n6 \nyeast cells, begins to exceed the number of ligand molecules (in a 1 to 2 ml sample). Thus, an off-rate based screening strategy was adopted in an effort to isolate mutants with improved affinity exceeding that of the first-generation clones (R-series). The off-rate method involves incubation of yeast cells with labeled TSST-1 under equilibrium conditions, followed by washing and incubation with a tenfold molar excess of unlabeled TSST-1. Pilot analysis of clone R9 showed that less than 10% of biotin-TSST-1 remained bound after two hours under these conditions (\nFIG. 4(\n \nb\n), and data not shown). Thus, yeast libraries were sorted after the two-hour dissociation period, and clones were isolated after the third (designated C-series) and fourth (designated D-series) cycles of selection. A total of 30 clones were examined for their ability to bind 5 nM TSST-1 in comparison to clones EP-8, R9, R17, and R18 (\nFIG. 4(\n \na\n)). Each clone exhibited binding that was equal to or better than the R-series of clones at this TSST-1 concentration. When the clones were examined using a single time-point off-rate analysis, similar to that used for sorting the library, it was evident that every clone showed significant improvements when compared to the first generation R-series clones (\nFIGS. 4(\n \nb\n) and \n6\n(\nb\n), below). For example, clones R9, R17, and R18 had less than 10% of the labeled TSST-1 remaining bound after 2 h at 25° C., while the off-rate selected clones had 50% or more of the labeled TSST-1 remaining bound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further examine TSST-1 off-rates, various mutants were examined for binding to labeled TSST-1 over a 5 h time period and at a higher temperature (37° C.). Histograms of clone C10 at several time points are shown in \nFIG. 5(\n \na\n). Mean fluorescence units (MFU) from histograms at various time points were plotted for each of the analyzed clones (\nFIG. 5(\n \nb\n)). While bound biotinylated TSST-1 from the two first-generation clones (R9, R18) was reduced to background levels by the first time point (30 min), three clones (C4, C10 and D10) retained significant levels of bound biotinylated TSST-1 even at the end of the time course (5 h). \nClone\n 10 retained approximately 50% of the TSST-1 after 5 h at 37° C. This time course was taken out to 24 h at 37° C., and while the levels of bound TSST-1 decreased, about 15% of TSST-1 remained bound to C10 after 24 h (\nFIG. 5(\n \na\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFourteen clones isolated from the off-rate based selection were sequenced (\nFIG. 2\n, and data not shown). Eleven clones contained CDR1 mutations derived from the CDR1 library. Three clones did not contain mutations in the regions of the second generation libraries (CDR1, CDR2 extended, and HV4), but they contained single-site mutations (e.g. clone C10). None of the clones were derived from the second extended CDR2 library, suggesting that \nresidues\n 54 to 56 were critical for TSST-1 binding and their sequences could not be optimized. Each clone contained the FR3 mutation E61V, which was presumably incorporated from clone R17 through a PCR-derived error. As described earlier, each of the affinity-matured clones also contained the stabilizing mutations that may act additively in the enhanced surface display of the hVβ2.1 region, as has been observed for mutations in the 2C TCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe absence of preferred mutations in the CDR1 clones, and the fact that clone C10 lacked CDR1 mutations altogether, suggests that CDR1 may not be involved in a significant way in binding TSST-1. Detailed inspection of the sequences indicates that the longer off-rates of these clones appear to be due to residues in the CDR2 and/or the E61V mutation, or a combination of these mutations. These results are supported by mutagenesis results described below.\n\n\n \n \nAlanine Scanning Mutagenesis of a High-Affinity hVβ2.1 Mutant C10\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further examine the role that the individual Vβ residues play in the interactions with TSST-1, alanine mutagenesis of selected wild-type and mutated residues of hVβ2.1 mutant C10 was performed. C10 was chosen as it exhibited high affinity with a decreased off-rate and yet contained the fewest number of mutations. Residues were chosen in part based on contact residues within the hVβ2.1-SpeC complex and also to define the mechanism by which C10 achieves high affinity. C10 alanine mutants were constructed in the yeast display vector in order to allow rapid analysis of binding without the need for protein purification. Similar approaches have been used to examine the role of individual residues or to map the binding epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. Mutants were first tested for their levels of surface expression with the anti-c-myc antibody to determine if mutation to alanine affected the folding and stability of the protein. All mutants expressed detectable c-myc epitopes, with levels that were similar to or slightly improved relative to C10 Vβ (data not shown). To quantify the binding to TSST-1, each mutant was analyzed for binding to 5 and 20 nM TSST-1 and a ratio of anti-c-myc to TSST-1 binding was determined (\nFIG. 6(\n \na\n)). These concentrations of TSST-1 are about 12 and 50-fold above the estimated K\nD \nof C10, respectively (see below), and thus were used to detect significant changes in affinity. Under these conditions, only Y56A, a mutation of a wild-type residue, was shown to affect significantly the binding of TSST-1. Further binding analysis by flow cytometry at higher TSST-1 concentrations and by SPR with soluble Y56A protein showed that TSST-1 binding affinity was reduced by ˜100-fold (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to characterize more precisely the impact of each mutation, a single point off-rate analysis of the yeast-displayed mutants was performed. Mutants were incubated with 5 nM biotinylated TSST-1, followed by incubation with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled TSST-1 for 2 h at 37° C. (\nFIG. 6(\n \nb\n)). Time points were taken at time zero (before unlabeled ligand was added) and at 2 h to calculate the percent of remaining bound ligand. Based on this study, four alanine mutations were shown to affect the off-rate significantly: F52aA, H53A, V61A, and K62A. Mutation of these residues to alanine reduced the fraction of bound ligand to levels comparable to that of clone R9. Because two of the four residues are present in R9 (F52a and H53), it was predicted that residues 61 (valine) and 62 (lysine) contribute to the longer off-rate of clone C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is worth noting that one clone, R17, from the first-generation of high-affinity mutants contained the E61V mutation, yet did not exhibit the slow off-rate characteristic of C10 (\nFIG. 6(\n \nb\n)). The only notable sequence difference between R17 and other R-series mutants is that the net charge of the CDR2 was neutral, rather than positive. Since the H53A mutation, like the E61V mutation, appears to affect the off-rate of C10, it is believed that two regions of electrostatic interactions are necessary to achieve the slow off-rate and high-affinity of C10. These regions include CDR2 and FR3.\n\n\n \nBinding Analyses of Selected Mutants by Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral of the clones from the affinity maturation process, and single-site mutants, were expressed in \nE. coli\n, refolded from inclusion bodies, and examined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the affinity and kinetics of their interactions with TSST-1 (\nFIG. 7\n and Table 1). As the wild-type hVβ2.1 domain does not express well in \nE. coli \n(data not shown), the stabilizing mutations appear to enable expression and refolding. The stabilized mutant EP-8 exhibited an affinity of 0.6 μM, similar to that observed previously for the full length wild-type hVβ2.1 (VβCb) (K\nD\n=2.3 μM). Based on SPR results with the higher affinity mutants, findings from the flow cytometric analysis on yeast were confirmed. The affinity of the first generation mutant R9 was increased by 180-fold (K\nD\n=12.6 nM), compared to the affinity of wild-type hVβ2.1. The affinity of the second generation mutants C10 and D10 were increased by 6800 and 12,800-fold (K\nD\n=340 pM and 180 pM, respectively). The 180-fold higher affinity of R9 was accomplished through substitutions of CDR2 residues (residues 50-53: wildtype, NEGSK; R9, RIDFH). As indicated above, the highly charged nature of each of the CDR2 mutants may suggest that electrostatics play a role in this affinity increase. Alternatively, enhanced affinity could be achieved through an increase in the buried hydrophobic surface area. Analyses of the binding kinetics indicate that the affinity increases from R9 to C10 and D10 are due to significantly reduced off-rates (17 and 41-fold) and only modest enhancements of on-rates (2.2 and 1.7-fold). The 17-fold slower off-rate of C10 compared to R9 is consistent with the results derived from flow cytometry experiments with C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC10 differs from R9 at only two residues, E61V and 191V. The faster off-rate observed in the V61A mutant, and the observation that all of the second-generation clones contain the E61V mutation, suggest that this mutation accounts for the slower off-rate and corresponding increase in affinity. This effect could be due to the loss of an acidic side-chain at \nposition\n 61, enabling a productive electrostatic interaction between TSST-1 and the lysine at position 62 in hVβ2.1. In support of this possibility, the K62A mutation also resulted in a significant reduction in the off-rate. In addition, soluble C10-K62A exhibited an affinity only twice that of R9, 17-fold reduced compared to C10 (Table 1). The lower affinity was due to a sevenfold faster off-rate and a 2.6-fold slower on-rate. Because the lysine side-chain is known to contribute to the overall hydrophobicity, the K62A mutation may act through a reduction in buried hydrophobic surface area. Whatever the mechanism is, these results show the involvement of the FR3 region at \npositions\n 61 and 62 in formation and stability of the C10-TSST-1 complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause Tyr56 of hVβ2.1 appeared to be the most important of the residues tested for binding to TSST-1, the binding properties of the soluble C10-Y56A mutant were examined (Table 1). The binding affinity of C10-Y56A was reduced 200-fold (K\nD\n=147 nM), with a 35-fold faster off-rate and a six-fold slower on-rate. While these results are based on the affinity of the engineered hVβ2.1 variant C10, the fact that Y56 is in the wild-type protein and that this residue represents one of the few unique residues of hVβ2.1 compared to other human Vβ regions, suggest that it contributes significantly to the binding energy and specificity of hVβ2.1 for TSST-1.\n\n\n \n \nTSST-1 and SpeC Binding to Overlapping Epitopes on hVβ2.1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether there is overlap in the binding sites for TSST-1 and SpeC on hVβ2.1, a competition experiment was performed. In this experiment, SpeC was immobilized on the SPR chip, the engineered hVβ2.1 called EP-8 was injected at various concentrations, and an affinity of approximately 6 μM was measured (\nFIG. 8(\n \na\n)). To determine if TSST-1 competed for binding of the hVβ2.1 (EP-8), various concentrations of TSST-1 were mixed with 12.5 μM EP-8, \nFIG. 8(\n \na\n) and (b)). The ability of EP-8 to bind the SpeC was reduced as more TSST-1 was present in the mixture (\nFIG. 8(\n \nb\n)), as would be expected if there were competition for the same binding site. In a control experiment, the SAg SEB, which does not bind to hVβ2.1, was used at the same concentrations as TSST-1 and competition was not observed (\nFIG. 8(\n \nc\n)).\n\n\n \nDiscussion\n\n\n \n \n \nSecreted bacterial toxins such as TSST-1 act as SAgs by stimulating cytokine release from a large fraction of T lymphocytes. The elevated systemic cytokine levels can lead to toxic shock syndrome and ultimately multi-organ failure. The mechanism of action of bacterial SAgs is now well known and a number of SAgs have been examined for the molecular basis by which they interact with T cells. However, the molecular details of the interaction of TSST-1 with hVβ2.1 has so far been refractory to structural analyses. TSST-1 is particularly important clinically, as it represents one of the most common toxins involved in TSS and as such it has significant involvement in staphylococcal mediated diseases. hVβ2.1, the specific major target associated with the effects of TSST-1 in humans was studied by: (1) engineering a stabilized hVβ2.1 domain that would be amenable to expression in \nE. coli \nand directed evolution by yeast display; (2) identifying specific targeted mutations in hVβ2.1 that would increase the affinity of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 interaction; and (3) generating and analyzing selected single-site mutations of hVβ2.1 that would reveal both the mechanisms by which higher affinity was achieved and the possible docking orientation of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe engineering of a stabilized, surface displayed hVβ2.1 mutant enabled expression of the protein in \nE. coli \nand subsequent refolding to concentrations sufficient for biochemical analyses. The mutations reside largely at the Vβ face, which would normally be buried at the interface with the Cβ region (\nFIG. 9(\n \na\n)). The stabilized hVβ2.1 mutant EP-8 bound to TSST-1 and SpeC with affinities that are close to those measured for the full-length β-chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results also implicate the region spanning the CDR2 loop and FR3 of hVβ2.1 (including residues 51-54, 56 and 61-62) as energetically critical for TSST-1 binding. Using the hVβ2.1 as a starting point, an energy minimized model of the high affinity mutant C10 was generated (the C10 mutations are solvent exposed). A hypothetical model of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 complex (\nFIG. 9(\n \nb\n)), was generated by manually docking the TSST-1 in a position on hVβ2.1-C10 that is consistent with each of the following observations (described in more detail below): (1) The most important energetic residue (Tyrβ56) lies near the center of the complex; (2) the \nframework region\n 61 to 63, which was shown to be important in the engineered hVβ2.1 mutants, is in contact with a region of TSST-1 that shows electrostatic complementarity; (3) the CDR3 of hVβ2.1 which was not involved in binding based on mutational analyses, is not in contact with TSST-1; (4) TSST-1 residues that were previously identified to be important in hVβ2.1 binding are located within contact distance in the hypothetical model; and (5) the position of TSST-1 on the hVβ2.1 region overlaps that of the binding site for SpeC (\nFIG. 9(\n \nc\n)) and thus SpeC binding would be competed by TSST-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this model, both the positive charges on CDR2 (Arg50 and His53) and FR3 (Lys62) are positioned near negatively charged residues (e.g. Asp11 and Asp18) in TSST-1. Alternatively, it is possible that mutations such as S52aF and E61Vact by increasing the buried hydrophobic surface area at the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 interface. Consistent with this possibility, the F52aA and V61A mutations both reduced the affinity, perhaps as a consequence of the reduced hydrophobicity of an alanine side-chain compared to phenylalanine and valine side-chains. Tyrosine 56 is predicted to be at the center of the interface, in a key position to interact with TSST-1. This location is consistent with the significant energetic contribution of Tyr56 (i.e. 100-fold decrease in binding for the Y56A mutant). Recent studies with high-affinity mouse Vβ mutants also showed that energetically important residues were located at the center of the interface. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that Tyr56 is located at the center of the engineered hVβ2.1-TSST-1 interaction. The identification of Tyr56 as an important residue within hVβ2.1 is also consistent with the observation that this residue is nearly unique among over 50 known human Vβ regions. In fact, only human Vβ4 contains a tyrosine at this position, but Vβ4 lacks positive charges in the CDR2 or at position 62 in FR3. This may explain why TSST-1 appears to be unusual among SAgs in that it is known to stimulate only a single human Vβ region, hVβ2.1. In further support of the role of Tyr56, mouse T cells that bear mouse Vβ15 are expanded by stimulation with TSST-1 and mouse Vβ15 contains a tyrosine at position 56.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, the putative electrostatic interactions or increased buried hydrobicity involved in the hVβ2.1-C10 interaction appear to be at least in part a consequence of engineering the CDR2 and FR3 regions to enhance these effects. Interestingly, the wild-type hVβ2.1 is highly charged at these positions and while the electrostatic effects may be masked to some degree by nearby neutralizing residues (e.g. Glu51 and Glu61), it is possible that there are electrostatic contributions that facilitate the docking of the wild-type hVβ2.1 in an orientation similar to that predicted for hVβ2.1-C10. Sequence analysis of human Vβ regions shows that the combination of lysine residues at \npositions\n 53 and 62 are unique to hVβ2.1. While two Vβ regions (Vβ19, Vβ30) have a lysine at position 62, they lack a positive charge within the CDR2. Furthermore, many Vβ regions actually contain aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues at \nposition\n 53 or 62, which could be detrimental to productive electrostatic interactions with TSST-1, based on the model. While structural studies will be required to examine these issues, the model suggests a different three-dimensional orientation of TSST-1 on hVβ2.1 compared to the hVβ2.1-SpeC complex (\nFIG. 9(\n \nc\n)). In this model, TSST-1 does not extend to the CDR3 of hVβ2.1, and it is shifted further toward the FR3 region. While the hVβ2.1 footprints of the TSST-1 and SpeC contact regions may differ, the model predicts that TSST-1 and SpeC have overlapping binding regions on hVβ2.1 in the area of CDR2.\n\n\n \nNeutralizing Agents for TSST-1\n\n\n \n \n \nThe engineering of soluble, high-affinity Vβ receptors for TSST-1 that have half-lives of many hours provides the basis for effective neutralizing agents against TSST-1. Soluble Vβ domains can be engineered with high affinity binding to superantigens. For example, soluble Vβ domains having ˜1500-fold higher binding affinity (K\nD\n˜5 nM) for SAg Staphylococcal enterotoxin C3 (SEC3) have been engineered. Soluble forms of these Vβ mutants were effective inhibitors of the in vitro activity of SEC3. It is desirable to generate Vβ domains with even higher affinities, since the enterotoxins are toxic at very low concentrations. Thus, this new generation of hVβ2.1 mutants, with greater than 10.000-fold improvements in affinity above the wild-type interaction (K\nD \nvalue of hVβ2.1-D10 of 180 pM affinity, for example), are useful as protein-based neutralizing agents against TSST-1.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nCloning and yeast display of human Vβ2.1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene for human Vβ2.1, residues 1-117, containing the mutation C13A, was cloned into the yeast display vector, pCT302, as a NheI-BamHI fragment. This construct contains two epitope tags, HA on the N terminus, and two tandem c-myc tags on the C terminus that serve as internal controls for protein expression. To generate a library of random mutants, the hVβ2.1 gene was amplified from the pCT302 plasmid using flanking primers with a method of error-prone PCR to give a 0.5% error rate (data not shown). The PCR product was transformed along with NheI-BglII digested pCT302 into the yeast strain EBY100, which allows the PCR product to be inserted into the plasmid by homologous recombination. The resulting library of approximately 10\n6 \ntransformants was grown on selective media for 48 h.\n\n\n \nFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe randomly mutated hVβ2.1 library was cultured for 36 h at 20° C. in medium containing galactose to induce protein expression. One hundred million cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of mouse anti-human Vβ2 monoclonal antibody (Beckman Coulter). Cells were stained with a 1:50 dilution of goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig-RPE (Southern Biotech) and selected on a MoFlo high-speed cell sorter (Cytomation). The most fluorescent cells (1%) were collected, cultured overnight in selective media, and then induced in galactose-containing media for 20 h. For the second sort, about 50×10\n6 \ncells were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of anti c-myc (9E10) antibody (Roche), followed by a 1:50 PE-labeled secondary antibody. For the third sort, cells were incubated with a 1:20 dilution of the anti-human Vβ2 antibody (selecting the top 0.5%), and for the fourth sort cells were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of anti-human Vβ2 antibody (selecting the top 0.25%). After four rounds of sorting, individual clones were obtained by plating on selective media.\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometry of Isolated Mutants\n\n\n \n \n \nIndividual yeast clones were cultured in glucose-containing media at 30° C. and induced in galactose-containing media at 20° C. for 30 h. Expression levels of hVβ2.1 were examined by incubating 0.4×10\n6 \nyeast cells with anti-HA antibody (Covance) (1:75 dilution), anti-c-myc 9E10 antibody (1:75 dilution), or anti-human Vβ2 antibody (1:50 dilution) in PBS-BSA for one hour on ice. After washing, cells were incubated with PE conjugated secondary antibody (1:50 dilution). TSST-1 binding was measured by incubating cells with various concentrations of biotinylated TSST-1 (Toxin Technology), followed by streptavidin-PE (BD Pharmingen) at a 1:500 dilution. Fluorescence levels were measured using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer gating on a healthy yeast population.\n\n\n \n \nAffinity Maturation of hVβ2.1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genes encoding stabilized hVβ2.1 mutants were amplified using site-directed mutagenesis with overlapping degenerate primers (with NNS codons). Five residues in the CDR2 (50, 51, 52, 52a and 53) were randomized by this method. DNA from stabilized mutant clones EP-6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 were pooled in equal amounts to use as the template DNA for the PCR. PCR products were incorporated into the yeast display plasmid pCT302 by homologous recombination to generate a library of 14×10\n6 \nindependent transformants. The CDR2 library was sorted using a similar approach as described above, except that yeast cells were incubated with decreasing concentrations of biotinylated TSST-1 for each round of sorting, followed by a 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-PE. Yeast cells were sorted through four cycles, and clones isolated from the fourth cycle were plated on selective media for further analysis. In a second round of affinity maturation, clones R9, R17, and R18 were used as templates. Libraries were constructed in CDR1 (\nresidues\n 27, 27a, 28, 29 and 30), CDR2 (\n \n \nresidues\n \n \n 52a, 53, 54, 55 and 56), and HV4 (\nresidues\n 68, 69, 70, 71, and 72). To select for higher affinity mutants with increased off-rates, the three libraries were pooled in equal amounts, incubated with 5 nM biotinylated-TSST-1 for 1 h on ice, followed by an incubation with a tenfold molar excess of unlabeled TSST-1 for 2 h at 25° C. Yeast cells were selected using these conditions through four cycles of sorting, and clones from the third and fourth cycle were plated.\n\n\n \nAlanine Scanning Mutagenesis\n\n\n \n \n \nAlanine residues were introduced into the human Vβ2.1 clone C10 in the following residues: CDR1 (Q28, T30), CDR2 (R50, I51, D52, F52a, H53, T55, Y56), FR3/HV4 (V61, K62, D63, K64, L66, N68, H69), and CDR3 (S98, S101). In addition two surface-exposed residues not predicted to be near the binding interface, K40 and E85, were included as controls. These single-site alanine mutations were constructed using the PCR method of splicing by overlap extension. The single-site mutants were transformed into yeast along with linearized pCT302 plasmid. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing and expression of the alanine mutants on the surface of the yeast was induced as described above. Alanine mutants were analyzed individually by flow cytometry.\n\n\n \nSurface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity-matured variants of hVβ2.1 were expressed in \nE. coli \nand refolded in vitro from inclusion bodies as described for murine Vβ8.2 variants affinity-matured for SEC3 binding. Affinity and kinetic analyses of the interactions between hVβ2.1 variants and TSST-1 were determined using a \nBIAcore\n 3000 SPR instrument (BIAcore) in 10 mM Hepes buffer containing 150 mM sodium chloride, 3.4 mM EDTA and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20, at 25° C. TSST-1 at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6) was immobilized (˜250 resonance units) to a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) using standard amine coupling methods. Staphylococcal entertoxin B (SEB) in an equivalent surface density was used as the control surface, as there is no specific binding between hVβ2.1 and SEB. All of the binding experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. Pulses of 10 mM HCl were used to regenerate both surfaces between injections. SPR data for association (k\na\n) and dissociation (k\nd\n) rates, as well as the dissociation constant (K\nD\n) were determined by globally fitting the data from different concentrations to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software version 4.1. For the EP-8 variant, which exhibits kinetics that are not possible to measure accurately by SPR, the affinity (K\nD\n) was determined by the Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding of varying concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA competition assay to determine if TSST-1 and SpeC compete for binding of hVβ2.1 was performed using a CM5 sensorchip with SpeC (˜500 RU) immobilized via standard amine coupling. Serial dilutions of the stabilized hVβ2.1 mutant EP-8 (100 μM-0.39 μM) were injected over the SpeC surface. Non-linear regression analysis yielded an affinity of ˜6 μM for the EP-8-SpeC interaction (data not shown). For the competition experiment, mixtures of EP-8 and TSST-1 were injected over the SpeC surface. The concentration of EP-8 was held constant at 12.5 μM while the concentration of TSST-1 was varied from 100 μM to 12.5 μM. As a control, an identical experiment was performed, in which SEB, which does not bind to EP-8/hVβ2.1, was used.\n\n\n \nMolecular Modeling\n\n\n \n \n \nA model of C10 hVβ2.1 was constructed using the coordinates of hVβ2.1 in complex with SpeC(\nPDB accession code\n 1 KTK). The C10 model was subjected to energy minimizations using the Gromos96 reaction field in Swiss PDB DeepView. Minimizations were performed using 50 steps of steepest descent and 50 steps of conjugate gradient. The model of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 complex was based on the C10 energy minimized model and the crystal structure of TSST-1 (PDB accession code 2TSS). The molecules were docked manually using the program MacPyMOL† and all structural representations were prepared using MacPyMOL.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nLong-Range Cooperative Binding Effects in a T Cell Receptor Variable Domain\n\n\n \n \n \nInteractions between proteins are essential for nearly all cellular processes (N. R. Gascoigne et al. (2004) Curr Opin Immunol 16:114-9; T. Pawson et al. (2000) Genes Dev 14:1027-47; A. J. Warren (2002) Curr Opin Struct Biol 12:107-14) and aberrant protein-protein interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases (J. F. Rual et al. (2005) Nature 437:1173-8). As the genome-wide mapping of protein-protein interactions has identified many of the molecular components of numerous physiological and pathological processes (S. Li et al. (2004) Science 303:540-3; T. Bouwmeester et al. (2004) Nat Cell Biol 6:97-105; L. Giot et al. (2003) Science 302:1727-36; P. Uetz et al. (2000) Nature 403, 623-7; T. Ito et al. (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:4569-74) and structural genomics efforts have determined structures of many of the constituent protein domains involved in these interactions, the ability to predict the binding specificities and energies of protein complexes from protein structures alone has reached paramount importance. Although significant progress in developing computational methods for the quantitative predictions of protein-protein interactions has been made recently (R. Guerois et al. (2002) J Mol Biol 320:369-87; S. Huo et al. (2002) J Comput Chem 23:15-27; T. Kortemme et al. (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99:14116-21; I. Massova et al. (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121:8133-8143; K. A. Sharp (1998) Proteins 33:39-48), the current robustness of these algorithms is not such that the laborious task of determining the structure of a given protein complex can be circumvented. It is clear that these methods are unable to account for aspects of molecular recognition that are important in determining complex formation, but for which there is currently a fundamental lack of understanding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been known for some time that protein-protein interfaces are structural and energetic mosaics. Certain amino acid residues within an interface contribute significantly to the binding energy, and are thus termed “hot spots” (T. Clackson et al. (1995) Science 267:383-6; A. A. Bogan et al. (1998) J Mol Biol 280:1-9; W. L. DeLano (2002) Curr Opin Struct Biol 12:14-20), while other residues are energetically silent with respect to the interaction. These hot spots, furthermore, are not homogeneously distributed throughout the interface, but are instead clustered to form “hot regions” (O. Keskin et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 345:1281-94; D. Reichmann et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:57-62). Further contributing to the heterogeneity of protein-protein interfaces is the frequent presence of cooperativity, such that the energetic contribution to binding of a protein that has been simultaneously mutated at multiple residues is significantly different than the summation of the changes in binding energy of the single-site mutants (S. Albeck et al. (2000) J Mol Biol 298:503-20; B. Bernat et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43:6076-84; J. Yang et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:50412-21).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe theory that residues within a single hot region are energetically cooperative, while those residing in distinct hot regions are strictly additive has arisen from both computational and experimental studies, including: a recent analysis (O. Keskin et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 345:1281-94) of a structurally non-redundant database of all hot regions (O. Keskin et al. (2004) Protein Sci 13:1043-55) currently in the Protein Data Bank (H. M. Berman et al. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res 28:235-42); and the mutational, energetic and structural analysis of residues within two hot regions of the TEM1-β-lactamase-β-lactamase inhibitor protein (TEM1-BLIP) complex (D. Reichmann et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:57-62). If, in all protein complexes, cooperative energetics existed only within hot regions, and not between them, the quantitative prediction of protein-protein interactions may be considerably simplified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further implication of the notion that distal regions of a protein-protein interface do not cooperate is that long-range conformational effects (e.g. allosterism) are also uncommon. Thus, binding at one site on a protein is unlikely to influence binding of a different ligand at a distal site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to test whether cooperativity could exist between hot regions, the interaction between affinity maturation variants of the human T cell receptor (TCR) variable domain 2.1 (hVβ2.1) and the superantigen (SAG) toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) was analyzed. TSST-1 is the major causative agent of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (P. Schlievert et al. (1981) J Infect Dis 143:509-16: J. K. McCormick et al. (2001) Ann Rev Microbiol 55:77-104) and these hVβ2.1 variants were engineered as potential therapeutic agents for SAG-mediated disease (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21). The highest affinity variant, D10, bound TSST-1 with an affinity of 180 pM, or 30,000-fold tighter than wild type hVβ2.1 (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21). By mutating each of the D10 variant residues and individually measuring the affinities for TSST-1 of the subsequent single-site mutants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, it is shown that four of the variant residues contribute significantly to affinity maturation. These residues are located in two distinct hot regions that are separated by about 22 Å. Mutations in these two distinct hot regions of hVβ2.1 are energetically cooperative when binding to TSST-1. Analysis of the hVβ2.1 structure (E. J. Sundberg et al. (2002) Structure 10:687-99) provides insight into how cooperativity between hot regions might occur in some protein-protein interactions but not in others. The protein core may act as an energetic sink to regulate inter-hot regional cooperative energetics. Furthermore, the TCR functions as a macromolecular complex with multiple CD3 subunits and the accessory molecules CD4 or CD8. Evidence for conformational effects between distant regions supports the view that inter-subunit associations are influenced by peptide-MHC (pMHC) binding. Accordingly, binding of pMHC by complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the V domains could effect the association of other subunits, leading to enhanced signaling by the complex.\n\n\n \nResults and Discussion\n\n\nIdentification of Energetically Significant Variant Residues in the Affinity Maturation Pathway\n\n\n \n \n \nThe high-affinity human Vβ2.1 (hVβ2.1) variant called D10, engineered by yeast display, contained 14 mutations beyond that of EP-8, the wild type hVβ2.1 analog that was selected for enhanced stability (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21). Because the yeast display libraries contained stretches of five randomly mutated codons, many of these mutations were likely not involved in affinity increases, but were incorporated in combination with a key mutation(s). In order to determine which of these mutations were significant contributors to the higher affinity interaction with TSST-1, site-directed mutagenesis to create 13 individual single-site mutants from the EP-8 template was performed, including: R10M, F27aT, Q28N, A29I, T30H, E50H, E51Q, S52aF, K53N, T55I, E61V, L72P and I91V (\nresidues\n 27a and 52a are non-canonical insertions into the hVβ2.1 CDR1 and CDR2 loops, respectively). The R113Q mutation was not made as this position is located on the face of the Vβ domain opposite that of the interface with TSST-1 and is thus unlikely to affect TSST-1 binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities of each of these single-site variants were determined by SPR equilibrium analysis. The differences in binding free energies relative to EP-8 (ΔΔG\nb\n) were calculated and a threshold value of 0.5 kcal/mol was used to determine whether a mutation exhibited energetic significance (\nFIG. 10A\n). Equilibrium binding analysis of the T30H mutant, as one that does not affect TSST-1 binding significantly, is shown (\nFIG. 10B-C\n). Four of the mutants (E51Q, S52aF, K53N and E61V) bound TSST-1 with significantly different affinities than EP-8. Surprisingly, the E51Q mutation bound TSST-1 with significantly lower affinity than did the wild type hVβ2.1 (\nFIG. 10D\n). The S52aF (\nFIG. 10E\n), K53N (\nFIG. 10F\n) and E61V (\nFIG. 10G\n) mutations significantly increased the binding affinity for TSST-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough four residues in the CDR1 loop of hVβ2.1 were mutated in the D10 high affinity variant, none of these mutations were energetically significant (\nFIG. 10A\n), indicating that the CDR1 loop may not form part of the binding interface with TSST-1. Three of these variant residues, at \n \npositions\n \n 28, 29 and 30, make contacts with the SAG SpeC in the hVβ2.1-SpeC crystal structure (E. J. Sundberg et al. (2002) Structure 10:687-99). Thus, although TSST-1 and SpeC compete for binding to hVβ2.1 (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21), they likely engage only partially overlapping binding sites on the TCR β chain.\n\n\n \n \nTwo Hot Regions in hVβ2.1 for TSST-1 Interaction\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree of the four energetically significant residues (51, 52a and 53) are located in the CDR2 loop, while the remaining important mutation site, at \nresidue\n 61, is located in framework region 3 (FR3). The remaining mutations, which do not significantly affect TSST-1 binding, are dispersed about the surface of the hVβ2.1 domain. Most, if not all, of these mutations contribute primarily to stabilization and display of the hVβ2.1 protein on the yeast surface (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21; E. V. Shusta et al. (2000) Nat Biotechnol 18:754-9; M. C. Kieke et al. (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:5651-6; M. C. Kieke et al. (2001) J Mol Biol 307:1305-15).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was previously shown that variant residues at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 52a, 53 and 61, and the wild type residue at position 62 act as hot spots for interaction with TSST-1 (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21). These residues form two clusters: \n \n \nresidues\n \n \n 51, 52a and 53 are located at the apex of the CDR2 loop; \nresidues\n 61 and 62 are positioned at the end of the turn within FR3 (\nFIG. 11B\n). These two clusters are connected by the c″ β-strand of the hVβ2.11 g domain, a secondary structural element common to all TCR variable Ig domains. The distance between the C\nα\n atoms of \n \nresidues\n \n 51 and 61 is 22.7 Å (E. J. Sundberg et al. (2002) Structure 10:687-99). According to a structural model of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 complex (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21), built by taking into account homology to the hVβ2.1-SpeC complex crystal structure (E. J. Sundberg et al. (2002) Structure 10:687-99) and alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis of both sides of the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 interface (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21; J. K. McCormick et al. (2003) J Immunol 171:1385-92), these clusters are located at the periphery of the interface and are as far apart as possible within that interface. Indeed, the distance between C\nα\n atoms of the most peripheral residues in the hVβ2.1-SpeC complex are a comparable 22.1 Å apart (E. J. Sundberg et al. (2002) Structure 10:687-99). These distances also greatly exceed the threshold of 13 Å used to define distinct discontinuous patches within larger protein-protein interfaces (P. Chakrabarti et al. (2002) Proteins 47:334-43). Thus, the energetically significant mutations in the D10 affinity maturation pathway are located in two distinct hot regions.\n\n\n \n \nSaturation Combinatorial Mutational Analysis Reveals a Variant with Higher Affinity Than the Penultimate Yeast Display Variant\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the hVβ2.1 mutations that contributed significantly to TSST-1 binding were identified, saturation combinatorial mutational analysis was carried out in order to dissect the additive and cooperative energetic properties between these residues. In this approach, hVβ2.1 mutants that incorporated every possible combination of wild type and mutant residues at each of the four variant positions, \n \n \n \nresidues\n \n \n \n 51, 52a, 53 and 61 were made. This amounts to a total of sixteen (2\n4\n) distinct hVβ2.1 mutant proteins, including EP-8 (the wild type analog), the four single-site mutants described above, six double mutants, four triple mutants and one variant that simultaneously incorporated all four mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was found that in another TCR Vβ domain-SAG model system that the affinity maturation pathway was restricted by negative cooperativity between two residues, each of which significantly increased the Vβ domain binding affinity for the SAG binding partner individually (J. Yang et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:50412-21). Structural analysis of this affinity maturation pathway showed that this negative cooperativity was a result of two CDR2 mutations that caused conformational changes in the CDR2 loop (S. Cho et al. (2005) Structure (Camb) 13:1775-1787). Because the unfavorable E51Q mutation was retained in all of the clones from the final (and highest affinity) sort of the yeast display affinity maturation, which includes the highest affinity variant D10 (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21; S. Cho et al. (2005) Structure (Camb) 13:1775-1787), it would seem likely that this mutation in combination with other mutations in D10 would act in a positively cooperative manner to increase the overall affinity for TSST-1. It was found, on the contrary, that the S52aF/K53N/E61V triple mutant, which incorporates only the three mutations that significantly increase TSST-1 affinity individually and not the E51Q mutation, binds with nearly a log-fold higher affinity than does D10 (Table I and \nFIG. 14A-B\n). Not only is the detrimental energetic effect of the E51Q mutation absent in this triple mutant, but this combination of mutations is also positively cooperative (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the dissociation kinetics of these interactions approach the measurement limits of current SPR technology (P. Schuck et al. (1999) Curr Opin Prot Sci 17:20.2.1-20.2.22), analogous binding experiments for the D10-TSST-1 and S52aF/K53N/E61V-TSST-1 interactions were performed in which the dissociation time was extended from 5 minutes to 2 hours, a 24-fold longer dissociation time (data not shown). Both the long dissociation times and the dissociation rate constant of the S52aF/K53N/E61V-TSST-1 interaction are similar to those of several high affinity antibody-antigen interactions analyzed by SPR (A. W. Drake et al. (2004) Anal Biochem 328:35-43). No significant differences in the measured off-rates were observed for these interactions, relative to the shorter dissociation time experiments shown in \nFIG. 14A-B\n. The S52aF/K53N/E61V triple mutant has a very high affinity to TSST-1 (K\nD \nvalue of 27 pM), and can be used as a therapeutic molecule for TSST-1-mediated disease.\n\n\n \n \nMutations within the CDR2 Hot Region are Cooperative\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether mutations within a hot region of the hVβ2.1 domain are energetically additive or cooperative, the TSST-1 binding affinities of each of the combinatorial variants incorporating all energetically significant mutations in the CDR2 loop were determined. This included the double mutants E51Q/S52aF, E51Q/K53N, S52aF/K53N and the triple mutant E51Q/S52aF/K53N. Kinetic parameters (in all cases except the E51Q/S52aF variant, for which the dissociation kinetics were too fast to measure accurately by SPR), affinities, ΔΔG\nb \nvalues relative to EP-8, and ΔG\nCOOP \nvalues (calculated as the difference between the summation of the changes in binding free energies of the single-site mutants and the experimental changes in binding free energies of the corresponding combinatorial mutant) are listed in Table 2. A representative SPR sensorgram for the E51Q/K53N double mutant binding to TSST-1 is shown in \nFIG. 14C\n. The experimental ΔΔG\nb \nvalues for these combinatorial variants and the ΔΔG\nb \nvalues of the summation of the corresponding single-site mutations are shown in \nFIG. 12A\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the previous threshold of |ΔG\nCOOP\n|≧0.5 kcal/mol for energetic cooperativity (J. Yang et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:50412-21), it was found that mutations at \n \nresidues\n \n 51 and 53 exhibit a moderate degree of positive cooperativity within the CDR2 hot region (\nFIG. 12B\n). This result differs from previous dissection of additive and cooperative energetics in the mVβ8.2-SEC3 affinity maturation system (J. Yang et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:50412-21), in which residues within the CDR2 loop were negatively cooperative. These findings do, however, reflect results from other molecular systems in which intra-hot regional mutations frequently exhibit positive cooperativity (O. Keskin et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 345:1281-94; D. Reichmann et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:57-62). The combination of mutations within the FR3 hot region, E61V and K62A, were not analyzed for cooperativity as \nonly residue\n 61 was altered in the affinity maturation pathway, while the other mutation originated as an alanine scanning mutant (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21).\n\n\n \nMutations Between the CDR2 and FR3 hot Regions are Positively Cooperative\n\n\n \n \n \nThe same strategy as outlined above to determine whether mutants that incorporate combinations of mutations from both the CDR2 and FR3 hot regions were additive or cooperative was employed. This entailed measuring TSST-1 binding parameters from the double mutants E51Q/E61V, S52aF/E61V, K53N/E61V, the triple mutants E51Q/S52aF/E61V, E51Q/K53N/E61V and S52aF/K53N/E61V, and the quadruple mutant E51Q/S52aF/K53N/E61V. Kinetic parameters, affinities, ΔΔG\nb \nand ΔG\nCOOP \nvalues for these mutants are listed in Table 2. A representative SPR sensorgram for the E51Q/K53N/E61V triple mutant binding to TSST-1 is shown in \nFIG. 14D\n. The experimental ΔΔG\nb \nvalues for these combinatorial variants and the ΔΔG\nb \nvalues of the summation of the corresponding single-site mutations are shown in \nFIG. 12A\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data show that mutation at \nresidue\n 61 in the FR3 hot region is highly positively cooperative (|G\nCOOP\n|≧1.0 kcal/mol) with either or both \n \nresidues\n \n 51 and 53 in the CDR2 hot region (\nFIG. 12B\n). Compared to the measured cooperativity within the CDR2 hot region, the cooperative energetics between residues from both hot regions are significantly greater in magnitude. For instance, the largest cooperative effect observed is that of the E51Q/K53N/E61V triple mutant, the combinatorial mutant incorporating mutations at \nFR3 residue\n 61 and the two CDR2 residues with which it is cooperative, 51 and 53. The difference in experimental versus additive changes in binding free energies for simultaneous mutation at these positions is −1.61 kcal/mol. In comparison, the E51Q/K53N variant, the most cooperative intra-hot regional combinatorial mutant, exhibits a ΔG\nb \nvalue of only −0.79 kcal/mol (\nFIG. 12B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination of mutations at residue 61 (FR3 hot region) with both residues 52 and 53 (CDR2 hot region) is moderately cooperative (|ΔG\nCOOP\n|≧0.5 kcal/mol). The S52aF/K53N/E61V triple mutant binds TSST-1 with a K\nD \nof 27 pM, while D10, the penultimate yeast display variant, binds TSST-1 with a K\nD \nof 180 pM. In the absence of the exhibited positive cooperativity, it was calculated that the triple mutant would instead bind TSST-1 with a K\nD \nof 89 pM, intermediate to the TSST-1 affinities of the S52aF/K53N/E61V mutant and D10, and more than three-fold tighter than if these mutations were strictly additive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious reports (O. Keskin et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 345:1281-94; D. Reichmann et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:57-62) had suggested that, contrary to mutations within a hot region, those between distinct hot regions are not cooperative, but strictly additive. These results suggest that this is not the case for all protein-protein interactions.\n\n\n \n \nThe Protein Core as an Energetic Sink that Regulates Cooperativity Between Hot Regions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two hot regions in the hVβ2.1 domain for TSST-1 binding are located before and after the c″ β-strand of the Ig domain. This strand has been shown to participate in a strand-switching event in TCR Vβ domains. In most Vβ domains, such as in hVβ2.1, the c″ β-strand is hydrogen bonded to the preceding c′ β-strand (\nFIG. 13A\n). In some Vβ domains, however, the c″ β-strand is hydrogen bonded to the following d β-strand. An example of this strand-switching is shown in \nFIG. 13B\n for the murine Vβ2 domain (D. Housset et al. (1997) Embo J 16:4205-16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe implications of strand-switching for the structure of the TCR Vβ domain and the interaction of proteins with this region of the Vβ domain are two-fold. First, the c″ β-strand can be considered to lie outside of the hydrogen bonded β-strand network that forms the hVβ2.1 protein core. This can be seen by comparison of \nFIGS. 13A and 13B\n, and is most clearly depicted in \nFIG. 13C\n, in which the mutated residues in both the CDR2 and FR3 hot regions, as well as the connecting c″ β-strand, are highlighted. Second, the c″ β-strand, relative to other β-strands in the TCR Vβ Ig domain, has a propensity for flexibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR2 and FR3 hot regions in hVβ2.1 may thus be considered as two balls connected by a string outside of the protein core (\nFIG. 13D\n). In such a situation, it is possible that cooperative energetics are a result of conformational changes transmitted along the c″ β-strand (i.e., the string) from one hot region to the other. Although the distance between the two hot regions spans the breadth of the molecular interface, and is thus as large as possible for the given protein-protein interaction, the connecting residues are positioned outside of the protein core, and thus, not integrally involved in forming the intramolecular contacts that stabilize the protein. Such a positioning of the hot region intervening sequence along the exterior of the protein core may increase the propensity for global conformational changes to be transmitted from one hot region to another, even though the c″ β-strand is hydrogen bonded to the c′ β-strand, itself part of the protein core, allowing for cooperative energetics. Cooperativity may arise in the hVβ2.1-TSST-1 system by a number of mechanisms, some of which have been observed in other molecular systems, including: (1) a tightening of the hVβ2.1 molecular surface upon TSST-1 binding, reminiscent of G protein-coupled receptors (D. H. Williams et al. (2004) J Mol Biol 340:373-83; D. H. Williams et al. (2004) Angew Chem Int Ed Engl 43:6596-616); or (2) the entropic costs of TSST-1 binding and conformational changes being not strictly additive, such as in the homodimerization of glycopeptide antibiotics (S. Jusuf et al. (2002) J Am Chem Soc 124:3490-1). These possibilities need to be tested by structural and thermodynamic studies, analogous to those that have been carried out to define the molecular basis for negative cooperativity within a hot region for another TCR Vβ-SAG interaction (J. Yang et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:50412-21; S. Cho et al. (2005) Structure (Camb) 13:1775-1787).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, it is suggested that hot regions for which the connecting residues are integrally involved in the formation of the protein core (\nFIG. 13E\n) result in additive energetics, even when the distance on the molecular surface between hot regions is short. These types of hot regions are most common in protein interfaces, and are representative of the hot regions in the TEM1-BLIP complex, the only other protein complex for which rigorous mutational analysis has been applied to address the question of additive versus cooperative energetics between hot regions, and for which it was found that inter-hot regional mutations were merely additive (D. Reichmann et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:57-62). Thus, the protein core is believed to serve to regulate cooperative energetics between hot regions by absorbing the energy from any conformational changes being transmitted from one hot region to another.\n\n\n \nLong-Range Cooperative Binding Effects Suggest Plausible Mechanisms for Initiation of T Cell Signaling\n\n\n \n \n \nThe finding of long-range cooperative effects in a V domain of the TCR may provide a framework for understanding how a multimeric TCR/CD3 complex could be influenced by ligand binding. In order to initiate T cell activation, the αβ TCR binds peptide antigens presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility molecules (MHC). These molecules on the T cell and antigen presenting cell (APC) are sequestered into an immunological synapse, into which other costimulatory molecules are directed during the signaling events (D. J. Irvine et al. (2002) Nature 419:845-9: C. Wulfing et al. (2002) Nat Immunol 3:42-7). For CD4\n+\n T cells, these include the coreceptor CD4 and numerous endogenous, or self, peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes. Although T cells are able to detect a single pMHC on the APC surface (D. J. Irvine et al. (2002) Nature 419:845-9; M. A. Purbhoo et al. (2004) Nat Immunol 5:524-30), monomeric ligands have been shown to be incapable of stimulating CD4\n+\n T cells (J. R. Cochran et al. (2000) Immunity 12:241-50; J. J. Boniface et al. (1998) Immunity 9:459-66). Self pMHC, by themselves unable to stimulate T cell activation, contribute significantly to T cell recognition of both CD4\n+\n (C. Wulfing et al. (2002) Nat Immunol 3:42-7) and CD8\n+\n cells (P. P. Yachi et al. (2005) Nat Immunol 6:785-92). CD4, when bound to an agonist pMHC complex, is incapable of engaging this agonist pMHC-specific TCR (J. H. Wang et al. (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:10799-804), but instead appears to orient the tyrosine kinase Lck to enable self pMHC to trigger many TCR (Q. J. Li et al. (2004) Nat Immunol 5:791-9). This and other evidence has led to the proposal of the “pseudodimer” model for the initiation of T cell activation (\nFIG. 13F\n), in which heterodimers of agonist and endogenous pMHC, stabilized by CD4, initiate T cell activation and control the sensitivity of the T cell response (D. J. Irvine et al. (2002) Nature 419:845-9; Q. J. Li et al. (2004) Nat Immunol 5:791-9; M. Krogsgaard et al. (2005) Nature 434:238-43).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther factors, however, are also important for TCR signaling. The TCR associates with CD3εδ and εδ heterodimers and the ζζ homodimer (\nFIG. 13F\n). NMR and crystal structures of CD3δε and εγ (Z. J. Sun et al. (2001) Cell 105:913-23; Z. Y. Sun et al. (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:16867-72; K. L. Arnett et al. (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:16268-73) have suggested that the TCR/CD3 complexes may act as a rigid transduction module and that a piston-like displacement upon interaction with pMHC could be the basis for the intracellular phosphorylation events that initiate activation. Conformational changes in the TCR upon pMHC interaction, as determined by a correlation between heat capacity changes and T cell stimulatory levels, may also play a role in T cell activation (M. Krogsgaard et al. (2003) Mol Cell 12:1367-78).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt remains unclear how all of these effects control T cell signaling. Long-range positive cooperative binding effects within the TCR variable domain, such as those observed in the system of TCR Vβ variants interacting with TSST-1, supports the possibility that ligand binding by CDRs could influence, through a conformational change, the association of other proteins with framework regions of the V domain. If such effects occur in the TCR upon engagement with pMHC and/or coreceptors, the energetic transmission between the CDR loops (white asterisk in \nFIG. 13F\n) and the “top” of the FR (black asterisk in \nFIG. 13F\n) provide a number of plausible mechanisms for augmenting T cell activation and sensitivity. Binary interactions between endogenous pMHC, coreceptors, TCR, and CD3 molecules are relatively weak, and a mechanism such as cooperativity could have profound impacts on the association of these molecules into higher-order associations required for signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, CD4-TCR interactions could be enhanced by TCR interaction with endogenous pMHC (\nFIG. 13F\n), resulting in a conformational change that leads to coordinate Lck and phosphorylating CD3 immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs). Although CD4 does not appear to affect the binding of TCR-pMHC when bound to the same pMHC (Y. Xiong et al. (2001) J Biol Chem 276:5659-67), CD4-TCR interactions could stabilize the otherwise weak interactions of CD4 with an endogenous pMHC complex. This could result in stabilization of the entire TCR/endogenous pMHC/CD4/TCR/agonist pMHC signaling complex. Alternatively, pMHC binding by the TCR could influence the TCR-CD3 interaction, resulting in either redistributions of the CD3 complex, or altered association with individual CD3 subunits. The latter might even occur indirectly through a TCR constant region interaction. Given the relatively weak associations among these TCR/CD3/CD4 (or CD8) assemblies, modest conformational effects could yield significant changes in their associations.\n\n\n \nImplications for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction and Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nA fundamental lack of understanding of cooperative energetics is one of the major impediments to formulating with greater accuracy algorithms for protein-protein interaction prediction. If cooperativity existed only within hot regions, and not between them, the task of accurately predicting the binding parameters for protein complexes would be greatly simplified. These results suggest that this may be an overly-generalized representation of macromolecular interfaces and that a broader consideration of cooperativity within protein-protein interactions, while more technically and computationally demanding, may ultimately lead to more accurate predictive algorithms. It also appears from these results that only a subset of hot regions, such as those that are connected to one another by structural elements that do not form part of the protein core, may need to be considered as potentially cooperative. Additional mutational analyses of diverse protein-protein interaction systems, such as those presented for the TEM1-BLIP complex (D. Reichmann et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:57-62) and that are shown here, will be required to confirm this.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause protein-protein interactions are pervasive in biological processes, they are also important therapeutic targets. The development of small molecule inhibitors of such interactions has proven difficult (M. R. Arkin et al. (2004) Nat Rev Drug Discov 3:301-17), largely due to the relatively planar nature of these interfaces, which tend not to present well-defined binding pockets. The presence of hot spots and hot regions within protein interfaces provide possible sites at which potent small molecule inhibitors may bind to effectively block the association of much larger molecules. Indeed, small peptides selected by phage display generally bind their protein binding partners at hot spots (S. S. Sidhu et al. (2003) Chembiochem 4:14-25), and the discovery of small molecules that inhibit the interaction of B7-1 with CD28 and modulate T cell activation, and in which the drug binds at a hot spot, has been reported (N. J. Green et al. (2003) Bioorg Med Chem 11:2991-3013; D. V. Erbe et al. (2002) J Biol Chem 277:7363-8). If certain distinct hot regions may be linked energetically, as these results suggest, the potency of a small molecule inhibitor that targets a cooperative hot region may be amplified relative to a small molecule that targets a hot region that is strictly additive. This has important ramifications for the choice of which hot region within a protein-protein interaction to target for small molecule inhibition, for instance, by structure-based drug design.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nProtein Production\n\n\n \n \n \nAll hVβ2.1 variants were expressed in \nE. coli \nand refolded in vitro from inclusion bodies as described previously for mVβ8.2 domain variants (J. Yang et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:50412-21). The wild type TSST-1 gene (tst) was PCR amplified from pCE107 (J. K. McCormick et al. (2003) J Immunol 171:1385-92), and cloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET41a (Novagen, Madison, Wis.). The forward primer amplified tst lacking the region encoding the signal peptide, and additionally, engineered a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (ENLYFQG) upstream of the tst gene, which when cloned, replaced the pET41a enterokinase cleavage site (DDDDK). The TSST-1 protein was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, Wis.), purified by Ni\n2+\n-column chromatography using the His\n6 \ntag, cleaved with autoinactivation-resistant His\n7\n:TEV as described (R. B. Kapust et al. (2001) Protein Eng 14:993-1000), and further purified by size exclusion chromatography.\n\n\n \nMutagenesis\n\n\n \n \n \nAll mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the pT7-7/EP-8 expression vector as a template (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21). For saturation combinatorial mutagenesis, the order of mutations was important, in that the complementary sites for oligonucleotide primers targeted to the three codons of interest in the CDR2 loop were overlapping, and thus, changed according to the sequence of the mutagenesis events. The double, triple and quadruple mutants were generated by sequential rounds of site-directed mutagenesis, such that the lower order mutation vectors were always used as templates for the higher order mutants.\n\n\n \nSurface Plasmon Resonance Binding Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe interaction of hVβ2.1 variants with immobilized TSST-1 was measured by SPR equilibrium and, where applicable, kinetic analyses using a \nBiacore\n 3000 SPR instrument (Biacore), as described previously (R. A. Buonpane et al. (2005) J Mol Biol 353:308-21). Briefly, 100-500 resonance units (RU) of TSST-1 were immobilized to a CM-5 sensorchip (Biacore) by amine coupling. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in an equivalent surface density was used as the control surface. The hVβ2.1 variants were injected at a flow rate of 25 μl/min, serially diluted in 10 mM Hepes buffer containing 150 mM sodium chloride, 3.4 mM EDTA and 0.005% surfactant P-20, interspersed with pulsed injections of 10 mM HCl to regenerate both surfaces. SPR data for association (k\na\n) and dissociation (k\nd\n) rates, as well as the dissociation constant (K\nD\n) were determined by globally fitting all data from multiple injected hVβ2.1 variant concentrations to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium binding analysis hVβ2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsingle-site mutants interacting with TSST-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK\nA\n \n\n\nK\nD\n \n\n\nΔG\nb\n \n\n\nΔΔG\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM\n−1\n \n\n\nM\n\n\nkcal/mol\n\n\nkcal/mol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEP-8\n\n\n1.7 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.48\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR10M\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n9 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.24\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF27aT\n\n\n1.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.39\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ28N\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n9 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.24\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA29I\n\n\n1.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.31\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT30H\n\n\n2.5 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.72\n\n\n−0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN50H\n\n\n1.7 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.56\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE51Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3 × 10\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n \n36 × 10\n \n−7\n \n\n\n\n\n−7.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS52aF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.8× \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n0.38 × 10\n \n−7\n  \n\n\n\n\n−10.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−1.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK53N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3× \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n\n\n−7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n−9.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−1.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT55I\n\n\n3.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.89\n\n\n−0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE61V\n\n\n\n\n \n154 × 10\n \n6\n \n\n\n\n\n0.065×  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n−11.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−2.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL72P\n\n\n1.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.32\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI91V\n\n\n2.5 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n−8.72\n\n\n−0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium affinity constants (K\nA\n) were derived by steady-state affinity analysis of surface plasmon resonance data.

A detailed description of the engineering by yeast display is provided below. Affinity maturation of the Vβ8 involved five successive generations (G1 through G5) of libraries containing various site-directed or random mutations, each followed by selection with biotinylated SEB and high-speed flow sorting. The mutagenic libraries included regions at the SEB:Vβ8 interface (\nFIG. 22B\n) as follows: G1: one half of CDR2, G2: the other half of CDR2, G3: \nframework region\n 2, G4: random mutagenesis, G5: CDR1. \nGenerations\n 1 through 4 libraries were selected with successively lower concentrations of SEB. Various clones from each library were screened for binding to SEB by flow cytometry and all were positive for binding to SEB, whereas wild-type Vβ is undetectable at this concentration (\nFIG. 22C\n and \nFIG. 27\n). Sequences of selected mutants from each generation are shown in \nFIG. 23\n. Conserved sequence motifs of affinity-matured clones, and their possible mechanisms of action, are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to further enhance affinity of the interaction, the fifth generation involved ‘extension’ libraries in CDR1, and an off-rate based selection scheme. The CDR1 ‘extension’ engineering was based on the premise that SEB is only 7A from CDR1 of Vβ8 and that SpeC contacts the CDR1 of human Vβ2.1, which contains an extra amino acid compared to Vβ8. Three yeast display libraries were made with different CDR1 lengths: ΔCDR1 (residues 26-30 randomized), CDR1+1 (residues 27-30 randomized, one amino acid inserted at position 27a), and CDR1+2 (residues 27a-30, with two amino acids inserted at positions 27a and b). Mutant G4-9 was used as template and the three libraries were pooled at equal ratios prior to selection, using off-rate based sorting. Fifteen clones from the final selection were screened for the amount of bound ligand remaining after four hours at 25° C. (\nFIG. 22D\n). All clones showed improvements over clone G4-9, which had <10% bound ligand remaining. In contrast, clone G5-8, had almost 50% bound SEB remaining after four hours. To examine the half-lives of the SEB:Vβ8 interactions at 37° C., full dissociation rate curves were measured for clones G4-9 and G5-8 (\nFIG. 28C\n). The half-life of the SEB:G5-8 interaction at 37° C. was approximately 20 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNine clones were sequenced (\nFIG. 23\n) and all but one clone was derived from the library that contained a single amino acid extension in CDR1 (CDR1+1 library). There was a strictly conserved tyrosine at position 28, a strong preference for serine or threonine at the inserted residue (27a), and a preference for aspartic acid at \nresidue\n 30. These preferences support the idea that these mutations contribute to the enhanced binding and longer off-rates of SEB for the Vβ mutants. The only clone (G5-10) from the wild-type length CDR1 library contained amino acids with long and bulky side chains (Arg, Trp) that may act by compensating for the lack of a CDR1 extension.\n\n\n \nAffinity Maturation of Vβ8 by Yeast Display\n\n\n \n \n \nTo engineer high-affinity receptor antagonists for SEB, the mouse Vβ8.2 domain was cloned into the yeast display vector, pCT202 (\nFIG. 22A\n). A stabilized mutant of the Vβ8 (called mTCR15) that exhibited higher surface levels on yeast, was used as the starting template for mutagenesis; mTCR15 contains the stabilizing mutation G17E. From the crystal structure of Vβ8 in complex with SEB, it is known that 50% of all contacts between the molecules are located in the CDR2 loop of the Vβ, which was the first focus for mutagenesis (\nFIG. 22B\n). Two libraries that each spanned four codons of this region were generated (A50-53 and A54-57) by PCR with degenerate primers, and the products were inserted into the yeast display vector, yielding libraries of 1.8×10\n7 \nand 8.1×10\n6 \nindividual transformants, respectively (see Table 5 for all library sizes). These library sizes should cover virtually all possible combinations of amino acids at the four positions (32 codons\n4\n=10\n6 \npossible combinations). The libraries were incubated with 650 nM biotinylated-SEB, followed by phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to collect the top 0.5% of fluorescent cells from each library, for a total of four consecutive rounds of cell sorting and growth. Yeast cells selected from the fourth round of sorting were plated and individual clones were analyzed for binding to SEB.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeast display library sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nApproximate Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration One\n\n\nCDR2Δ50-53\n\n\n1.8 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR2Δ54-57\n\n\n8.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration Two\n\n\nG1-17Δ54-57\n\n\n5.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG1-18Δ54-57\n\n\n4.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG1-24Δ50-53\n\n\n \n \n9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration Three\n\n\nG2-3Δ47-50\n\n\n1.5 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG2-5Δ47-50\n\n\n1.8 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG2-8Δ47-50\n\n\n1.3 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG2-9Δ47-50\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration Four\n\n\n \nRandom Mutagenesis\n \n\n\n \n \n6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration Five\n\n\nG4-9 CDR1 (26-30)\n\n\n1.9 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG4-9 CDR1 + 1 (27-30)\n\n\n1.9 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG4-9 CDR1 + 2 (27a-30)\n\n\n1.9 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFive clones from each library of this first generation of mutagenesis and selection were screened for binding to SEB by flow cytometry and all were positive for binding to SEB, compared to wild-type Vβ which was undetectable at this concentration (\nFIG. 22C\n and \nFIG. 28A\n). Sequencing of the 10 clones revealed 3 unique sequences from each library (G1 clones, \nFIG. 24\n). All of the A50-53 clones retained the wild-type residue Gly51, consistent with our previous alanine scanning study that a G51A mutation had the largest impact on Vβ8 binding to the structurally similar toxin SEC3. A conserved A52I or A52V mutation was found in each clone. The A52V mutation has been shown in a structural study of an affinity matured Vβ8:SEC3 interaction to act by increasing the number of intermolecular contacts with Tyr90 of SEC3 (an identical residue with SEB) and by influencing the HV4 region. The other most conserved feature of the three Δ50-53 mutants was a substitution of positive-charged residues (H is or Arg) at Gly53. The side chain of this residue is in a position such that it could point directly into the cleft between the small and large domains of SEB (\nFIG. 22B\n). In addition, two of the mutants contained a single-site mutation (G42E) that was apparently the product of a PCR error. Like G17E, the G42E mutation is located distal to the SEB binding site and has been shown previously to be involved in enhancing surface display of the Vβ (\nFIG. 22B\n). The three unique clones derived from the Δ54-57 library also exhibited conserved features, the most notable being a S54H mutation. Since this residue is also positioned at the cleft between the SEB small and large domains, it may act like the positive-charged mutations at \nresidue\n 53. Two of the three clones exhibited a presumed PCR-derived H47Y mutation. As described below, a similar mutation (H47F) was observed in subsequent engineering steps. It may provide some improvement in SEB binding as the side chain of His47 is within 4 Å of Phe177 of SEB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on SEB-binding titrations of a first generation clone compared to the Vβ8 L2CM mutant that cross-reacted with SEB at an affinity of approximately 250 nM, the affinity of these lead clones appeared to be in the high nanomolar range (\nFIG. 28A\n and data not shown). To further affinity mature the Vβ8, second generation libraries were constructed using representative clones from the first generation as templates. Clones G1-17 and G1-18 were chosen from the Δ50-53 library, and clone G1-24 was chosen from the Δ54-57 library. To optimize the contacts in the CDR2 region, the adjacent CDR2 residues, 50-53 or 54-57, were randomized. Both libraries were sorted using 6 nM SEB and the top 0.5% of cells was collected for a total of four rounds of sorting. However, only the library derived from the Δ50-53 template yielded a positive population of yeast cells selected at this SEB concentration. Fifteen clones were screened for binding to 100 nM SEB, and each clone was improved compared to the G1-17 mutant and L2CM (\nFIG. 28B\n). Titrations of two of the clones suggested they had affinities in the low nanomolar range (\nFIG. 28B\n). Four unique sequences were observed among ten of the G2 clones that were sequenced (\nFIG. 23\n). All of the clones contained two mutations, S54N and T55V that must account for the increase in affinity since these were the only mutations in two of the clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause residues on the N-terminal side of CDR2 are within contact distance of SEB, a third generation of affinity maturation focused on residues 47-50. Clones G2-3, G2-5, G2-8, and G2-9 were used as templates, the library was incubated with 100 μM SEB, and the top 0.5% of cells were collected through four rounds of sorting. A positive population of cells was isolated after four sorts, and 14 clones were analyzed for binding to 10 nM SEB. Eleven clones had improved binding to SEB (\nFIG. 27C\n) and the five clones with the highest fluorescence were sequenced (\nFIG. 23\n). All of the clones differed in sequence, but each contained a strictly conserved H47F mutation, and the wild type serine at position 49. As described above, the H47F mutation could be involved directly in SEB binding, whereas it appears that Ser49 probably acts indirectly by stabilizing the CDR2 loop.\n\n\n \n \nCharacterization of SEB-Binding Clones Isolated from Yeast Display\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 15\n shows the sequences of mVβ8.2 mutants isolated for binding to SEB. Clone mTCR15 is a stabilized mutant of mVβ8.2. LC2M was previously isolated for binding the closely related superantigen, SEC3, and has a low level of cross-reactivity for SEB.

Percent remaining bound was calculated as (MFU after 4 hours at 25° C./MFU at time zero)×100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 19\n shows off-rates of fourth generation (G4) and fifth generation (G5 m4-8) SEB-binding clones. The yeast displayed constructs were incubated with 5 nM biotinylated SEB for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation with a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled SEB at 37° C. Aliquots were removed at the indicated timepoints and stored on ice until the end of the timecourse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 20\n shows surface plasmon resonance analysis of affinity matured mVb8.2 variants binding to SEB.

Dilutions of the mVb8.2 variants are from top to bottom as follows: 20 nM; 10 nM; 5 nM; 2.5 nM; 1.25 nM; 0.625 nM; 0.3125 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA previous study showed that successive generation of random mutants yielded improvements in a monoclonal antibody affinity from low nanomolar to femptomolar levels. Accordingly, a fourth generation library was made using error-prone PCR and the five sequenced clones from the third generation library (\nFIG. 23\n) as templates. The library was incubated with 100 μM SEB, and the top 0.5% of cells were collected through four rounds of sorting. A shift in the positive population of cells, compared to third generation clones, was observed. Nine clones were analyzed with 1 nM SEB by flow cytometry, and each of the clones showed significant binding at this SEB concentration (\nFIG. 27D\n). The five clones with the highest level of SEB binding were sequenced and a mutation was found in only a single position, N24S or N24K. Asn24 is located at the end of the CDR1 loop, and although it does not appear to be close enough to make contact with SEB, it appears to increase the level of surface display of the Vβ molecule (\nFIG. 28A\n) and hence it may play a role in Vβ stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile titration of the G4 mutants suggested the binding affinity was in the low nanomolar range (\nFIG. 28A\n), it was reasoned that the affinity might be further increased by generating ‘extension’ libraries in CDR1, and by using an off-rate based selection scheme. The CDR1 ‘extension’ engineering was based on the premise that SEB is only 7A from the CDR1 of Vβ8 and that SpeC contacts the CDR1 of human Vβ2.1, which contains an extra amino acid compared to Vβ8.2. To test the idea of using ‘extension’ libraries to reshape this interface, three yeast display libraries were made with different CDR1 lengths: ACDR1 (residues 26-30 randomized), CDR1+1 (residues 27-30 randomized, one amino acid inserted at position 27a), and CDR1+2 (residues 27a-30, with two amino acids inserted at positions 27a and b). Mutant G4-9 was used as template, and the three libraries were pooled at equal ratios prior to the first round of selection, using off-rate based sorting. The approach involved incubating the yeast with biotinylated SEB (5 nM) for one hour, followed by a two-hour incubation at 25° C. with a ten-fold molar excess of unlabeled SEB (two hours had been shown to yield >90% loss of bound SEB by clone G4-9). Yeast cells were sorted and a decreasing percentage of cells were collected through each of four rounds (1% to 0.25%). At the end of the third and fourth rounds, distinct positive populations of yeast cells were observed, and cells were plated to analyze individual colonies. Fifteen clones were screened based on a single-point off-rate of four-hour duration at 25° C. (\nFIG. 22D\n). All clones showed improvements over the fourth generation clone (G4-9), which had <10% bound ligand remaining after this incubation. In contrast, clone G5-8, had almost 50% bound SEB remaining after four hours at 25° C. To examine the half-lives of the SEB:Vβ8 interactions at 37° C., full dissociation rate curves were measured for clones G4-9 and G5-8 (\nFIG. 28C\n). The half-life of the SEB:Vβ8-G5-8 interaction at 37° C. was approximately 20 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA total of nine clones were sequenced (\nFIG. 23\n) and all but one clone was derived from the library that contained a single amino acid extension in CDR1 (CDR1+1 library). There was a strictly conserved tyrosine at position 28, a strong preference for serine or threonine at the inserted residue (27a), and a preference for aspartic acid at \nresidue\n 30. These preferences support the idea that these mutations contribute to the enhanced binding and longer off-rates of SEB for these Vβ mutants. The only clone (G5-10) that was isolated from the wild-type length CDR1 library contained amino acids with long and bulky side chains (Arg, Trp) that may act by compensating for the lack of a CDR1 extension. In the crystal structures of both the SpeA-Vβ8.2 and SEC3-Vβ8.2 complexes, residue 28 of the CDR1 loop makes contact with the SAg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 6 below shows the results of extending the CDR1 loop.

To further characterize Vβ8 mutants and to examine their effectiveness as neutralizing agents, several clones were expressed in \nE. coli\n, and refolded from inclusion bodies. The binding affinity and kinetics of their interactions with SEB were measured using surface plasmon resonanace (SPR) (Table 7). Second-generation clone G2-5 was found to have an affinity of 650 pM (\nFIG. 24A\n), fourth-generation clone G4-9 had an affinity of 195 pM, and fifth-generation clones all had affinities of 48 to 100 pM (\nFIG. 24B\n, Table 1, and \nFIG. 29\n). The highest affinity mutant, G5-8, had a K\nD \nvalue of 48 pM, a 3-million fold improvement in binding affinity for SEB compared to wild-type Vβ8.2 (K\nD \nvalue=144 μM).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEB binding and in vitro inhibitory properties of Vβ8 affinity matured variants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nk\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\nd \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nD \n(M)\n2\n \n\n\nt\n1/2 \n(min)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT TCR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n    1.44 × 10\n−6\n \n\n\n \n\n\n>2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(mTCR15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG2-5\n\n\n3.81 ± 0.26 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.48 ± 0.23 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n6.49 ± 0.16 × 10\n−10\n \n\n\n4.6\n\n\n860 ± 385\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG4-9\n\n\n3.66 ± 0.29 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.13 ± 0.44 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n1.95 ± 0.04 × 10\n−10\n \n\n\n16.2\n\n\n144 ± 49 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nG5-4-3\n\n\n2.99 ± 0.27 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.47 ± 0.40 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n8.20 ± 1.24 × 10\n−11\n \n\n\n46.8\n\n\n \n \nND\n4\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nG5-4-6\n\n\n3.16 ± 0.40 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.91 ± 0.14 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n6.09 ± 0.42 × 10\n−11\n \n\n\n60.5\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG5-4-8\n\n\n3.44 ± 0.20 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.64 ± 0.08 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n4.75 ± 0.12 × 10\n−11\n \n\n\n70.4\n\n\n62 ± 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG5-4-9\n\n\n2.50 ± 0.16 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.32 ± 0.19 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n9.31 ± 0.50 × 10\n−11\n \n\n\n49.8\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG5-4-10\n\n\n3.04 ± 0.41 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.09 ± 0.43 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n6.84 ± 0.87 × 10\n−11\n \n\n\n55.3\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nBinding parameters derived from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of three independent binding analyses for each bimolecular interaction, using global curve-fitting kinetic analysis and the BIAevaluation 4.1 software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2\nWild-type TCR mVβ8.2-Cβ was previously determined by SPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3\nBased on the IC\n50 \nvalues of three independent titrations in polyclonal T cell assays in the presence of 35 nM SEB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n4\nNot determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Neutralization of SEB by Soluble High-Affinity Vβ Regions\n\n\n \n \n \nTo explore whether successive generations of affinity-matured Vβ proteins also yielded improvements in neutralizing activity, in vitro T cell activation assays were performed. In these assays, the human class II-positive cell, Daudi, was loaded with \n51\nCr and incubated with SEB (35 nM) together with various concentrations of soluble Vβ antagonists. The Vβ8\n+\n cytotoxic \nT cell clone\n 2C was used as effectors (\nFIG. 24C\n). Four soluble Vβ proteins were tested, including wild type Vβ8 (mTCR15), and representative Vβ proteins from three generations of the affinity maturation process: G2-5, G4-9, and G5-8. As expected, wild type Vβ8 (micromolar affinity) was completely ineffective at neutralizing the activity of SEB. In contrast, all three of the higher affinity Vβ antagonists inhibited SEB-mediated activity, with a clear correlation between neutralizing potential and affinity. 10\n50 \nvalues were five- to ten-fold lower for G5-8 (K\nD\n=48 pM) compared to G2-5 (K\nD\n=650 pM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases of TSS, SEB stimulates a polyclonal population of T cells that can express different Vβ regions. Therefore, the neutralizing potential of Vβ8 proteins was also examined using effector cells from heterogeneous T cell populations. SEB-reactive splenic T cells from BALB/c mice were induced in culture in the presence of SEB and used as effector cells together with Daudi target cells, SEB (35 nM), and soluble Vβ antagonists (\nFIG. 24D\n). The results were similar to those obtained with Vβ8\n+\n CTL clone 2C, in that affinity-matured proteins exhibited neutralizing activities (IC\n50 \nvalues) that were directly proportional to their binding affinities, with G5-8 exhibiting a 15-fold lower IC\n50 \nvalue than G2-5 (Table 7). Thus, the Vβ antagonists are capable of neutralizing SEB-reactive T cells, regardless of the Vβ region that is expressed, and neutralization is enhanced by improvements in affinity.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nIn Vivo Neutralization of SEB in Rabbit Models of Toxic Shock Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine if Vβ proteins were able to neutralize the activity of SEB in vivo, rabbit models of TSS and toxin-mediated lethality were examined. First, the Vβ was tested in an endotoxin-enhancement rabbit model. This model mimics the clinical situation in which patients with acute-phase TSS have detectable amounts of endotoxin in their sera. While the role of endotoxin in development of TSS in humans is not clear, exposure of rabbits to SAgs enhances their susceptibility to endotoxin shock by up to one million-fold. In this study, rabbits were injected with 5 μg/kg SEB, and fever response was monitored over the course of 4 hours. Rabbits invariably develop fevers within 4 hours and subsequent injection of \nSalmonella typhimurium \nLPS causes death in less than 12 hours. In the first experiment, 5 μg/kg/mL SEB was incubated with 500 μg/kg/mL of purified G5-8 Vβ (hereafter referred to only as Vβ) for one hour. Rabbits were then injected i.v. with the SEB/Vβ combination or 5 μg/kg/mL SEB alone (control), and fever response was monitored. Rabbits in the control group developed fevers (approximately 2° C. increase), whereas rabbits that received the SEB/Vβ combination exhibited no elevation in temperature (\nFIG. 25A\n). After four hours, each rabbit was injected i.v. with 0.15 μg/kg LPS, which is 100 times the LD\n50 \nwhen pre-treated with 5 μg/kg SEB (the LD\n50 \nof LPS alone is 500 μg/kg). All rabbits that were treated with SEB alone died, while all rabbits that were treated with SEB/Vβ survived with no adverse effects (\nFIG. 25B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an independent experiment, three rabbits that were injected with ten-times less neutralizing agent (50 μg/kg/mL Vβ) immediately after injection of SEB also showed no increase in temperature and survived (data not shown). Based on this result, the minimal Vβ dose that would be capable of protecting animals was assessed. In this experiment, four groups of rabbits (3 per group) were injected with SEB (5 μg/kg/mL) together with different amounts of the Vβ, from 0.325 to 325 μg/kg/mL. As shown in \nFIG. 25C\n, the Vβ neutralizing agent was completely protective at 32.5 and 325 μg/kg/mL and partially protective at 3.25 μg/kg/mL (two of the three rabbits survived). On a molar basis, this concentration of Vβ (\nMol weight\n 12 kDa) is close to that of SEB used in the experiment (5 μg/kg/mL; Mol weight ˜28 kDa). This finding supports the notion that the high affinity of the G5-8 Vβ drives formation of the inactive complex (Vβ:SEB), even at low doses of the Vβ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to compare the active concentration of Vβ with the current treatment of TSS involving human IVIG, various lots of human IVIG (ZLB Bioplasma AG lyophilized prep; IVEEGAM (Immuno AG) lyophilized prep; a Bayer IVIG liquid prep) were assayed for titers against SEB by ELISA. All three IVIG lots had titers of 640, better than the average titer of 80-160 found in most humans). In human TSS, IVIG is typically used at concentrations of 1000 to 2000 μg/kg. In accord with this, four groups of rabbits (3 per group) were injected with SEB (5 μg/kg/mL) together with different amounts of the IVIG preparation from ZLB Bioplasma, from 12 to 12000 μg/kg/mL. As shown in \nFIG. 25C\n, 12000 μg/kg/mL showed complete protection, 1200 μg/kg/mL showed partial protection (1 rabbit survived), and 120 and 12 μg/kg/mL showed no efficacy. The amount of IVIG and Vβ required to save one-half of the rabbits was estimated to be 6600 μg/kg/mL and 3 μg/ml/kg, respectively. Thus, there was approximately a 2200 fold difference in activity between human IVIG and the Vβ agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was next examined whether rabbits with elevated temperatures due to SEB exposure could be rescued by treatment with Vβ. Rabbits were injected with 5 μg/kg SEB and two hours later, after rabbits had developed a fever, they were injected with 500 μg/kg of Vβ. Control rabbits continued to exhibit fevers at 4 hours, whereas the temperatures of rabbits that were treated with the Vβ returned to normal ranges (\nFIG. 26A\n). As in the experiment with combined treatment of SEB and Vβ, all rabbits that were treated with Vβ survived LPS exposure, whereas all control rabbits died (\nFIG. 26B\n). It was also examined if rabbits that were successfully treated with the Vβ protein would be susceptible to SEB a month later, and whether such rabbits could be successfully treated a second time (e.g. it is possible that induction of anti-SEB or anti-Vβ antibodies could have influenced a second exposure to SEB). In this experiment, four rabbits that were successfully treated were each administered SEB again. Two hours later, three of the four rabbits were given the Vβ. After LPS injections, all three treated rabbits survived, but the control rabbit (untreated after the second SEB exposure) died.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final rabbit model involved a miniosmotic pump system for slow delivery of SEB. This system mimics the situation that might be encountered in a staphylococcal infection involving TSS. In this model, pumps containing 200 μg SEB/200 μL PBS were implanted in rabbits, and SEB was delivered at a rate of approximately 25 μg/day over 8 days. The experimental group received daily injections of 100 μg Vβ, beginning at the time that pumps were implanted. The temperatures of rabbits at \ntime\n 0 and on \nday\n 2 showed that the control rabbits exhibited characteristic fevers, while the treated rabbits did not (\nFIG. 26C\n). All control rabbits died of TSS during the 8-day period, whereas all treated rabbits survived (\nFIG. 26D\n).\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetic Study of Vβ in Rabbits\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to gain insight into the in vivo action of the Vβ agents, a pharmacokinetic study was performed. Radiolabeled Vβ (\n125\nI-Vβ) was injected into four rabbits, two without previous SEB treatment, and two that had an immediate prior injection with 200 μg of SEB and blood samples were taken from each rabbit. Analysis of the combined results (\nFIG. 30\n) using a two-phase exponential showed a t\n1/2 \nof the a redistribution phase of 7 minutes, and a t\n1/2 \nof the 13 clearance phase of 325 minutes. The presence of excess SEB did not have a significant effect on the serum lifetimes of the \n125\nI-Vβ\n˜\n. These results appear to place the clearance properties of this Vβ domain between V\nH \nor scFv fragments and Fc-bearing antibodies (scFv-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n3, scFv-Fc or full IgG), which have been reported to have 13 phase t\n1/2 \nvalues of 20 to 30 minutes (V\nH\n, scFv), 5 to 8 hours (scFv-C\nH\n3), and several days to a week (scFv-Fc and IgG). It remains to be seen if Vβ domains in general will differ in their pharmocokinetic properties from different V\nH \ndomains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the in vivo distribution of the \n125\nI-Vβ, rabbits were euthanized and tissues were sampled for radioactivity three hours after injections (Table 8). The majority of counts were present in the urine, consistent with the small size of the protein (12 kDa). Among tissues sampled, the spleen showed the largest concentration of radiolabel, with a modest increase in the presence of SEB (170%). Kidney showed the most significant increase in localization of Vβ in the presence of SEB, with a 370% increase compared to Vβ in the absence of SEB. This result could be due to various effects, including the larger size of the Vβ:SEB complex (˜60 Å, compared to the free Vβ˜30 Å), which may alter the filtration properties of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodistribution of \n125\nI-labeled Vβ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin rabbits three hours after injection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVβ only\n\n\nVβ and SEB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(% ID/gm)\n1\n \n\n\n(% ID/gm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrgan/\nFluid\n \n \nRabbit #\n \n1\n\n\n \nRabbit #\n2\n\n\n \nRabbit #\n1\n\n\n \nRabbit #\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiver\n\n\n0.184\n\n\n0.164\n\n\n0.173\n\n\n0.177\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKidney\n\n\n0.086\n\n\n0.088\n\n\n0.328\n\n\n0.312\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpleen\n\n\n0.567\n\n\n0.540\n\n\n0.889\n\n\n1.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThymus\n\n\n0.168\n\n\n0.157\n\n\n0.170\n\n\n0.166\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood\n\n\n0.201\n\n\n0.210\n\n\n0.186\n\n\n0.164\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrine\n\n\n5.668\n\n\n5.918\n\n\n8.222\n\n\n8.775\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nPercent injected dose per gram of tissue (or ml of blood and urine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQUENCE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ.

In fact, some strains of MRSA produce 10-100 times more exotoxin than their non-resistant counterparts, making them more likely to induce TSS. Potential neutralizing agents for SEB include monoclonal antibodies to SEB or human IVIG, which has been used in some severe cases of TSS. However, each of these approaches has significant drawbacks. Clinical use of anti-SEB monoclonal antibodies will require a dedicated program for generation, engineering, and pre-clinical testing of human antibodies, similar to that being conducted with antibodies to botulism toxin. On the other hand, human IVIG can exhibit variable success among different pools. For these reasons, a small, easily produced receptor-based therapeutic that directly blocks toxin action is presented here. This ˜12,000 dalton, Ig-like Vβ protein was engineered by sequential mutagenesis and selection to an affinity that is three million-fold higher than the wild-type receptor. The soluble receptor was able to prevent lethality in rabbit models of TSS (16/16 rabbits survived with treatment, 13/13 died without treatment—not including the experiment assessing Vβ versus IVIG dose efficacy). The protection occurred even when animals were treated with Vβ protein after exposure to toxin and after elevation in body temperature as is characteristic of TSS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious studies with monoclonal antibodies to anthrax toxin and botulism toxin have shown that higher binding affinities are associated with improved inhibitory potential. The same relationship was observed here in SEB neutralization assays, even when comparing relatively high affinity Vβ proteins (e.g. K\nD \nvalues of 650 to 48 pM). Accordingly, clinical effectiveness of soluble receptors can be optimized using the highest affinity agent available. A recent approach that compared soluble forms of two different receptors for anthrax toxin also showed that the higher affinity receptor was more effective. The approaches here of sequential engineering each contact region, and generating extensions in the CDR1, are generally useful in achieving such high-affinities. This is especially important when the contact surface involves a single Ig-like domain rather than the full antibody Fv, allowing maximal surface complementarity and interactions with ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is unclear if the relatively small size of these Vβ domains (12 KDa), or even their shorter serum lifetimes (β phase t\n1/2 \nof ˜325 minutes), may actually enhance their in vivo effectiveness compared to a full IgG molecule (150 KDa). It is possible that the ability of the smaller Vβ proteins to penetrate tissue more effectively than IgG may be useful, especially since the action of SAgs requires cell-to-cell interactions that occur in tissues. The pharmacokinetic studies performed with the Vβ suggest that its serum lifetime may be adequate to treat with excess agent on a daily basis, over a period of a few days. The efficacy, especially in comparison to human IVIG, suggests that the high-affinity of the agent may have allowed a dose that was near stoichiometric with SEB. In contrast, IVIG was required at high doses, perhaps because even in the highest titer preparations the level of natural antibodies to SEB are orders of magnitude lower than the single monospecific Vβ agent. There are some factors that should be optimized for the use of these therapeutic agents but the efficacy at low doses and the ability to express the proteins in \nE. coli \nprovide additional evidence that Vβ treatments are feasible economically. Another advantage of their small size is that immunogenicity of the Vβ should be minimal. Immunogenicity associated with multiple injections of a protein should not pose a problem, since an individual who develops TSS may only do so once or twice in their lifetime, requiring a short course of therapeutic intervention without multiple chronic treatments common for monoclonal antibody therapy of autoimmune diseases or cancer. These factors are easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe properties of these Vβ domains are not unlike camelid antibodies, or single V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomains. These proteins have been characterized for their stability and solubility, leading to the development of human V\nH \ndomains that bind to selected antigens with high affinity. As shown here for engineered Vβ proteins, V\nH \nproteins can also be expressed at high levels in \nE. coli\n, while full-length antibody production typically requires mammalian cell culture. Furthermore, the fact that the wild type Vβ:SEB interaction has even lower ‘starting’ affinity (K\nD\n=144 μM) than many lead V\nH \nproteins shows that the generation of Vβ domains that bind to other antigens is possible and that these are driven to very high-affinities\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the rabbit models that were tested here, successful treatment was observed in cases where the Vβ was administered after toxin had already induced elevated temperatures in animals. In addition, animals survived SEB delivered from miniosmotic pumps, when they were given daily injections of the neutralizing agent. It would not be difficult to provide such agents on a prophylactic or post-infection basis in a clinical setting by following routine procedures known to one having ordinary skill in the art. Clearly, staphylococcal or streptococcal infections might involve the presence of multiple toxins that may require neutralization. While the relative importance of SEB versus other toxins in the disease states is not clear, a single Vβ agent could neutralize more than one toxin. For example, G5-9, which binds to SEB with 93 pM affinity, was shown to bind to SEC3 with 2.5 nM affinity (data not shown). Although toxins such as TSST-1 have less structural similarity with SEB (than does SEC3), it is possible to generate picomolar binding affinity Vβ domains against TSST-1. One application is to rapidly detect the presence of specific toxins, and to match the toxins that are present with a neutralizing Vβ therapy.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\nYeast Display Library Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mVβ8.2 gene with the G17E stabilizing mutation was subcloned into the yeast display plasmid (pCT202) with an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal c-myc tag (\nFIG. 22A\n). Libraries of mutant Vβ TCR DNA were produced by site directed mutagenesis using overlapping degenerate primers (with NNS codons). After amplification, the PCR product was digested with Bsal and ligated into pCT202. The ligated product was digested with Dpnl to remove methylated template DNA and transformed into \nE. coli \nDH10B to amplify the plasmids. Intact plasmids were transformed by electroporation into the yeast strain EBY100. To create the fourth generation library of random mutants, the third generation templates (G3-5, 6, 9, 10, 12) were amplified using flanking primers with a method of error-prone PCR to give a 0.5% error rate. For the fourth and fifth generation templates, the PCR product was transformed along with NheI/XhoI digested pCT202 or NheI/BglII digested pCT302 into the yeast strain EBY100, which allows the PCR product to be inserted into the plasmid by homologous recombination. Transformants were grown on selective media for 48 hours. The estimated sizes of each the yeast display library is shown in Table 5.\n\n\n \nFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\n\n\n \n \n \nTo induce protein expression, the yeast libraries were cultured for 24-48 h at 20° C. in medium containing galactose. For the first generation sorting, 5×10\n7 \ncells were incubated with 650 nM biotinylated SEB (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, Fla.) for one hour on ice. Cells were washed with PBS-0.5% BSA and stained with a 1:200 dilution of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (BD Pharmingen) in PBS-0.5% BSA and selected on a MoFlo high-speed cell sorter (Cytomation). The most fluorescent cells (0.5%) were collected, cultured overnight in selective media, and then induced in galactose-containing media for 20 h. This process was repeated three more times for a total of four rounds of sorting. After the fourth round of sorting, individual clones were obtained by plating on selective media. For the second generation library, 5×10\n7 \ncells were stained with 6 nM biotinylated SEB followed by a 1:200 dilution of streptavidin-PE. The most fluorescent cells (0.5%) were collected, for a total of four rounds of sorting. For the third generation library, 5×10\n7 \ncells were incubated with 100 μM biotinylated SEB, with a 1:200 dilution of streptavidin-PE. The most fluorescent cells (0.5%) were collected each round, over four rounds of sorting. For the fourth generation library, 5×10\n7 \nclones were stained using conditions identical to the third round of sorting. The fifth generation libraries were combined at equal ratios, and 1×10\n8 \ncells were incubated with 5 nM biotinylated SEB for one hour on ice. The cells were washed and then incubated with 50 nM unlabeled SEB for 2 hours in a 25° C. water bath (5×10\n7\n, 3×10\n7\n, 2×10\n7 \ncells were stained for the second, third and fourth sorts). Cells were stained with a 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-PE. The most fluorescent cells (1%) were collected for the first round, followed by 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.25% for the second, third, and fourth sorts, respectively.\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometry of Isolated Mutants\n\n\n \n \n \nIndividual yeast clones were grown in glucose containing media at 30° C. and protein expression was induced by culturing in galactose containing media at 20° C. for 24-36 hours. Cells (4×10\n5\n) were incubated with various concentrations of biotinylated-SEB for one hour on ice. After washing, cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of streptavidin-PE. Fluorescence levels were measured on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer.\n\n\n \nPurification of Soluble Vβ Domains\n\n\n \n \n \nAll proteins used in the in vitro activity assays and in the rabbit experiments were expressed in BL21(DE3) \nE. coli \nusing the pET28 expression vector (Novagen). The protein was refolded in vitro from inclusion bodies as described previously. Proteins were purified with Ni agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) or by ion exchange chromatography (MonoS column, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) followed by HPLC (BioCad Sprint) using a gel filtration column (\nSuperdex\n 100 column, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.)). Proteins were dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4 before use in tissue culture experiments or in animals.\n\n\n \nSurface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\n \n \n \nSPR analysis of Vβ-SEB interactions was performed as described previously. Briefly, Vβ proteins were purified by an additional gel filtration chromatography step in HBS, pH 7.4 just prior to binding analysis on a \nBicaore\n 3000 SPR instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, N.J.). SEB was immobilized by standard amine coupling to a CM5 sensor chip at a density of 500 response units (RU). An equivalent density of TSST-1, which exhibits no detectable binding to Vβ8 or its affinity-matured variants, was used as a control surface for all experiments. Serial dilutions of Vβ proteins were injected for up to 3 minutes at a flow rate of 25 ml/min and allowed to dissociate for up to 10 minutes prior to regeneration of the binding surfaces. The kinetic parameters for association and dissociation were determined using the BiaEvaluation 4.1 software (Biacore, Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\n \nT Cell Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nDaudi, a human lymphoma expressing class II MHC, but not class I, was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 4×10\n−6\nM β-mercaptoethanol (KF media). 2C CTLs were expanded in culture until confluent by culturing in KF media supplemented with 10% rat concavalin A supernatant+5% α-methyl mannoside, and mitomycin C treated Balb/c splenocytes. Polyclonal CTLs were expanded from balb/c splenocytes by culturing at a density of 4×10\n6 \ncells per well in a 24-well plate for 72 hours in KF media, 10% rat concavalin A supernatant, 5% α-methyl mannoside, and 1 μg/mL SEB. Daudi cells were resuspended in 100 μCi \n51\nCr (MP Biomedicals) for one hour at 37° C. After washing, 10\n4 \nCr-loaded Daudi cells were added in a volume of 504/well in 96-well U-bottom plates. SEB was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL (35 nM). Soluble Vβ protein was added at various concentrations in a volume of 50 μL. Plates were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 30 min. 10\n5 \nCTLs were added per well in a volume of 50 μL. RPMI media was added to standardize well volumes to 200 μL. Plates were centrifuged 5 min at 800 rpm, and incubated at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 4 hours. 80 μL of cell supernatant was removed after centrifugation of the plate for 5 min at 800 rpm, and \n51\nCr release was measured in a gamma counter. Percent inhibition was calculated as ((max cpm−experimental cpm)/(maximum cpm))×100. For all values, spontaneous release cpm were subtracted.\n\n\n \nEndotoxin Enhancement Model of Toxic Shock Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nSAgs have been well-characterized to amplify the lethal effects of endotoxin through synergistic release of TNF-α. There is an inverse log:log relationship between dose SAg pretreatment and dose of endotoxin required to cause deaths of rabbits. In these studies, young adult rabbits (approximately 2 kg, both sexes) were conditioned to a pyrogen test apparatus, equipped with continuously in-place rectal thermocouples, for 3 hours the day before use and 1 hour the day of use. At the beginning of experimentation, the animals were injected intravenously with SEB (5 μg/kg/ml) in PBS (0.005M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.15M NaCl) and temperatures monitored hourly for 4 hours. At designated time points, intravenous injections of soluble antagonist and endotoxin (\nSalmonella typhimurium\n), 0.15 μg/kg/ml, were given. Animals were monitored for up to 48 hours for signs of TSS and death. Signs of TSS included fever, diarrhea, labored breathing, and conjunctival reddening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIVIG preparations were generously provided by ZLB Bioplasma AG, Berne, Switzerland; Immuno AG, Vienna Austria (Oesterreichisches Institut fuer Haemoderivate G.m.b.H., IVEEGAM); and Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany and used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. ELISA for determination of antibody titers against SEB were performed with use of Nunc-Immuno plates Maxisorp (Roskilde, Denmark). Plates were coated with 1 μg SEB, and serial 2-fold dilutions of IVIG preparations were made, beginning with a 1:10 dilution. Assays were developed with peroxidase conjugated goat antibodies against human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. St. Louis, Mo.). Titers were determined as the reciprocal of the last dilution to give an absorbance at 490 nm wavelength of greater than the negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in rabbits, Vβ and IVIG protein concentrations were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). The samples were diluted in sterile PBS for intravenous injection into marginal ear veins. Dose ranges for administration to rabbits were 0.325 to 325 μg/ml/kg for Vβ and 12 to 12,000 μg/ml/kg for human IVIG. Animals were injected with SEB (5 μg/kg/ml) and then 4 hours later endotoxin (0.15 μg/kg/ml) as above. Deaths were recorded over 48 hours. The LD\n50 \nmethod of Reed and Muench was used to estimate the doses of Vβ and IVIG required for 50% protection of animals. All animal experimentation was performed according to guidelines of the University of Minnesota IACUC.\n\n\n \nMiniosmotic Pump Model of Toxic Shock Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nThe model of Parsonnet et al. was used to assess the ability of Vβ protein to inhibit TSS development during continuous SAg administration. Rabbits are highly sensitive to the TSS-inducing and lethal effects of SAgs when continuously released from subcutaneously implanted miniosmotic pumps (Alza, Palo Alto, Calif.). These pumps have been shown to release a constant amount of SAg to animals over the course of 8 days. An SEB dose of 200 μg is approximately 4 times the LD\n50 \nby this model. Young adult rabbits (approximately 2 kg, either sex) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and 1 cm incisions made on the left flanks. A subcutaneous pocket was made in each rabbit that was large enough to accommodate the miniosmotic pumps (0.5 cm×2 cm). Miniosmotic pumps were loaded with SAgs and implanted; the animals are then closed with three sutures and allowed to wake. The animals were returned to their cages and monitored for TSS symptoms and death over the course of 8 days. Fevers in this model occur maximally on \nday\n 2. Soluble Vβ was administered i.v. in PBS daily.\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetic Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nRadiolabeling of soluble Vβ with \n125\nI was performed by G. Brown, GE Healthcare, Woburn, Mass. with use of the lactoperoxidase method. The iodinated Vβ was determined to have a specific activity of 161 μCi/μg soluble Vβ, with 1.8% free iodide. By radioimmunoassay, at least 70% of the radiolabel was able to bind SEB immobilized on ELISA plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn pharmacokinetic studies, 4 rabbits were administered iodinated Vβ (35.48×10\n6 \ncpm in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% normal rabbit serum). Two rabbits received 200 μg SEB in 1 ml PBS intravenously immediately prior to receiving Vβ, and two rabbits received 1 ml of PBS prior to receiving Vβ. Blood samples (0.1 ml) were drawn from the marginal ear veins of each rabbit at 30 seconds and then 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after injection. Radioactivity in blood samples was determined with use of a Perkin Elmer Wizard 1470 gamma counter (Shelton, Conn.). At the end of 180 minutes, each animal was sacrificed, and samples of various organs and urine were removed for determination of Vβ in tissues. At termination of the experiment, approximately 75% of the iodinated Vβ in the blood retained ability to bind to SEB immobilized onto ELISA plates (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll references throughout this application, for example patent documents including issued or granted patents or equivalents; patent application publications; and non-patent literature documents or other source material; are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, as though individually incorporated by reference, to the extent each reference is at least partially not inconsistent with the disclosure in this application (for example, a reference that is partially inconsistent is incorporated by reference except for the partially inconsistent portion of the reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patents and publications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the levels of skill of those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. References cited herein are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety to indicate the state of the art, in some cases as of their filing date, and it is intended that this information can be employed herein, if needed, to exclude (for example, to disclaim) specific embodiments that are in the prior art. For example, when a compound is claimed, it should be understood that compounds known in the prior art, including certain compounds disclosed in the references disclosed herein (particularly in referenced patent documents), are not intended to be included in the claim.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Markush group or other grouping is used herein, all individual members of the group and all combinations and subcombinations possible of the group are intended to be individually included in the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvery formulation or combination of components described or exemplified can be used to practice the invention, unless otherwise stated. Specific names of substances are intended to be exemplary, as it is known that one of ordinary skill in the art can name the same substances differently. When a compound is described herein such that a particular isomer or enantiomer of the compound is not specified, for example, in a formula or in a chemical name, that description is intended to include each isomers and enantiomer of the compound described individual or in any combination. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that methods, superantigens, starting materials, and synthetic methods other than those specifically exemplified can be employed in the practice of the invention without resort to undue experimentation. All art-known functional equivalents, of any such methods, superantigens, starting materials, and synthetic methods are intended to be included in this invention. Whenever a range is given in the specification, for example, a temperature range, a time range, or a composition range, all intermediate ranges and subranges, as well as all individual values included in the ranges given are intended to be included in the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “comprising” is synonymous with “including,” “containing,” or “characterized by,” and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. As used herein, “consisting of” excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim element. As used herein, “consisting essentially of” does not exclude materials or steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claim. Any recitation herein of the term “comprising”, particularly in a description of components of a composition or in a description of elements of a device, is understood to encompass those compositions and methods consisting essentially of and consisting of the recited components or elements. The invention illustratively described herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element or elements, limitation or limitations which is not specifically disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms and expressions which have been employed are used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed. Thus, it should be understood that although the present invention has been specifically disclosed by preferred embodiments and optional features, modification and variation of the concepts herein disclosed may be resorted to by those skilled in the art, and that such modifications and variations are considered to be within the scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims. Applicant does not wish to be bound by any theory presented herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general the terms and phrases used herein have their art-recognized meaning, which can be found by reference to standard texts, journal references and contexts known to those skilled in the art. The definitions provided are to clarify their specific use in the context of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see e.g. Fingl et. al., in The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 1975, Ch. 1 p. 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity, or to organ dysfunctions. Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response were not adequate (precluding toxicity). The magnitude of an administered dose in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated and to the route of administration. The severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. A program comparable to that discussed above also may be used in veterinary medicine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the specific conditions being treated and the targeting method selected, such agents may be formulated and administered systemically or locally. Techniques for formulation and administration may be found in Alfonso and Gennaro (1995). Suitable routes may include, for example, oral, rectal, transdermal, vaginal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, intravenous, or intraperitoneal injections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to formulate the compounds herein disclosed for the practice of the invention into dosages suitable for systemic administration is within the scope of the invention. With proper choice of carrier and suitable manufacturing practice, the compositions of the present invention, in particular those formulated as solutions, may be administered parenterally, such as by intravenous injection. Appropriate compounds can be formulated readily using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art into dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents intended to be administered intracellularly may be administered using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such agents may be encapsulated into liposomes, then administered as described above. Liposomes are spherical lipid bilayers with aqueous interiors. All molecules present in an aqueous solution at the time of liposome formation are incorporated into the aqueous interior. The liposomal contents are both protected from the external microenvironment and, because liposomes fuse with cell membranes, are efficiently delivered into the cell cytoplasm. Additionally, due to their hydrophobicity, small organic molecules may be directly administered intracellularly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount to achieve the intended purpose. Determination of the effective amounts is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. The preparations formulated for oral administration may be in the form of tablets, dragees, capsules, or solutions, including those formulated for delayed release or only to be released when the pharmaceutical reaches the small or large intestine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levitating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein. The compositions and methods and accessory methods described herein as presently representative of preferred embodiments are exemplary and are not intended as limitations on the scope of the invention. Changes therein and other uses will occur to those skilled in the art, which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention, are defined by the scope of the claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the description herein contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, but as merely providing illustrations of some of the embodiments of the invention. Thus, additional embodiments are within the scope of the invention and within the following claims. Some references provided herein are incorporated by reference herein to provide details concerning additional starting materials, additional methods of synthesis, additional methods of analysis and additional uses of the invention.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n1.

More particularly the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said modulators and methods of treating diseases or disorders responsive to modulating said interaction. Other aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the description below.\n\n\n \n2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induced \ngene\n 2 EBI2, also called GPR183, codifies for a receptor which belongs to the superfamily of Rhodopsin-like 7™ receptors (seven transmembrane segment receptors), also known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). EBI2, is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor for which no ligand is known. EBI2 was cloned in 1993 as one of the most up-regulated genes (>200 fold) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected Burkitt lymphoma cells (Birkenbach, M., et al. (1993). Epstein-Barr virus-induced genes: first lymphocyte-specific G protein-coupled peptide receptors. J. Virol. 67, 2209-2220.). The EBI2 gene is localized on chromosome 13q32.3. EBI2 shares approximatively 35% homology at the amino acid level with the fowlpox virus FPV206, 30-32% with P2Y5 and P2Y9 receptors. EBI2 is also closely related to the \norphan\n 7™ receptor GPR18 and the two lipid receptors \ncysteinyl leukotriene receptor\n 1 and −2 (CysLT1, and −2) (25% and 28% homology respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal-time PCR of EBV-infected cells showed high expression of EBI2 during latent as well as lytic viral replication (Rosenkilde, et al. (2006) Molecular pharmacological phenotyping of EBI2—An orphan seven-transmembrane receptor with constitutive activity. Journal of Biological Chemistry 281 [19], 13199-13208.). Very high expression of the EBI2 gene was reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in lymphoid tissue (spleen and lymph node) and lung tissue (Birkenbach, M., et al. (1993); Rosenkilde, M. M. et al. (2006)). EBI2 expression was shown to be highest in B-lymphocytes, followed by T lymphocytes, NK-cells and lowest in monocytes (Rosenkilde, M. M. et al. (2006), Cahir-McFarland, E. D. et al. (2004). Role of NF-kappa B in cell survival and transcription of latent membrane protein 1-expressing or Epstein-Barr virus latency III-infected cells. J. Virol. 78, 4108-4119.). The expression profile of EBI2 suggests a role in immune system modulation. Finally, constitutive signaling through Gαi and cell surface localization of EBI2 was also demonstrated (Rosenkilde, M. M. et al. (2006)).\n\n\n \n \nIt is an object of the present invention to identify ligands for EBI2.\n\n\n \n3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based, at least in part, on finding that 7,25DHC and 7,27DHC and 7HC and 25HC are ligands for EBI2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a modulator (e.g. inhibitor) of the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC (i.e. ligand) and EBI2 (e.g. human EBI2), preferably between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2 (e.g. human EBI2), especially 7a,25DHC and EBI2 (e.g. human EBI2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of this aspect, the modulator binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2, preferably with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2, more preferably with 7a,25DHC and/or EBI2, and inhibits the interaction between ligand and EBI2. The inhibitor may be a therapeutic protein, such as an antibody or antibody fragment, or a small molecule chemical entity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of this aspect, the modulator modulates (e.g. inhibits) the endogenous production of 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC production, preferably the modulator modulates (e.g. inhibits) the endogenous production of 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC, by for example, inhibiting the endogenous enzymatically mediated production of 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC production, preferably the modulator inhibits the endogenous enzymatically mediated production of 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC. The modulator may inhibit the enzyme responsible for the conversion of the immediate precursor of 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC, preferably of precursors of the immediate precursor of 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC to 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some other embodiments of this aspect the modulator is selected from the group consisting of; small chemical entity, antibody, Adnectin, Ankyrin, Maxybody/Avimer, Affibody, anticalin, Affilin, anti-sense oligonucleotide, short-interfering RNA (siRNA).

When the modulator is an antibody, it may comprise human constant region and/or may have an IgG isotype (e.g. IgG1 or IgG4) and/or may be a chimeric, human or humanised antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the modulator is an antibody fragment, the antibody fragment is selected from the group consisting of; Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2, Fv, ScFv, VH domain, VHH domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further other embodiments of this aspect the modulator is an inhibitor of EBI2 expression. Such inhibitors maybe an anti-sense oligonucleotide comprising or consisting essentially of a sequence (a) capable of forming a stable triplex with a portion of the EBI2 gene, or (b) capable of forming a stable duplex with a portion of an mRNA transcript of the EBI2 gene under physiological conditions. Alternatively, or in addition, the inhibitor may be an antisense oligonucleotide or a short-interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule which inhibits the expression of EBI2 protein (e.g. is capable of interfering with the translation of the EBI2 transcript).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a modulator of the first aspect supra together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of this second aspect, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a third aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating a mammalian patient, particularly a human patient afflicted with a disease or disorder responsive to modulation of the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2, preferably between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2, which method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical aspect of the second aspect supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a prophylactic method of treating a mammalian patient, particularly a human patient afflicted with a disease or disorder responsive to modulation of the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2, preferably between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2, which method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical aspect of the second aspect supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the these third and fourth aspects, the disease or disorders is selected from the group consisting of; hypertension, angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, stroke, obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, (especially rheumatoid arthritis) and lupus, atopic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitisasthma, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, viral infections such as EBV, HIV, hepatitis (A or C), fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis (particularly alcohol induced liver cirrhosis), cancer, dyslipidemia, diabetes (particularly type II), transplant rejection, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, diseases of chronic inflammation, allergy, psoriasis, cystic fibrosis, hypercholesterolaemia, renal disease multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fifth aspect there is provided a process for the manufacture of a modulator of the first and a pharmaceutical composition of the second aspect supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of identifying a modulator, particularly an inhibitor of the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2, preferably between 7a,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2 which method comprises contacting 7,25DHC and/or 7HC and/or EBI2, preferably between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2, with a candidate modulator and observing a modulation of the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout this specification, the term “7,25DHC”, “7,27DHC”, “25HC” and “7HC” includes all enantiomers, stereoisomers, racemate mixtures and optically pure isomer forms thereof.

The terms “7a,25DHC” and “7a,27DHC” throughout this specification indicates only optically pure or substantially optically pure isomer forms. Thus, the terms “7a,25DHC” and “7a,27DHC” should be construed as referring to individual embodiments of optically pure isomer forms of the indicated ligands. Similarly, the terms “7b,25DHC”, “7b,27DHC”, “7aHC”, “7bHC” and “25HC” should also be construed as referring to individual embodiments of optically pure isomer forms of the indicated ligands. Therapeutic proteins, polynucleotides and oligonucleotides as described herein are in isolated form. Reference in \nsection\n 4 of this specification to “EBI2” refers to human EBI2 unless otherwise specified. Likewise, reference to diseases or disorders refers to human diseases or disorders.\n\n\n \n4.1—Therapeutic Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nA therapeutic protein of the present invention maybe an antibody, Adnectin, Ankyrin, Maxybody/Avimer, Affibody, anticalin, or Affilin.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.—Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention maybe in any of a number of formats well known to the skilled person. These formats include intact antibodies, various antibody fragments and other engineered formats as described below. In preferred forms, antibodies of the present invention are provided as a monoclonal population.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1 —Intact Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIntact antibodies include heteromultimeric glycoproteins comprising at least two heavy and two light chains. Aside from IgM, intact antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of approximately 150 KDa, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Typically, each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes varies. Each heavy and light chain also has intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant regions. Each light chain has a variable domain (VL) and a constant region at its other end; the constant region of the light chain is aligned with the first constant region of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. The light chains of antibodies from most vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two type called Kappa or Lambda based on the amino acid sequence of the constant region. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, human antibodies can be assigned to five different classes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. IgG and IgA can be further subdivided into subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4; and IgA1 and IgA2. Species variants exist with mouse and rat having at least IgG2a, IgG2b. The variable domain of the antibody confers binding specificity upon the antibody with certain regions displaying particular variability called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The more conserved portions of the variable region are called Framework regions (FR). The variable domains of intact heavy and light chains each comprise four FR connected by three CDRs. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies. The constant regions are not directly involved in the binding of the antibody to the antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation in antibody dependent cell-mediated cytoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis via binding to Fcγr receptor, half-life/clearance rate via neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and complement dependent cytoxicity via the C1q component of the complement cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided an intact therapeutic antibody of binding 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibiting the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the intact therapeutic antibody binds 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2. Such antibodies typically have a human constant region of an IgG isotype such as IgG1 or IgG4 and maybe human, humanized or chimeric.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1.1 Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman antibodies may be produced by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art. Human antibodies can be made by the hybridoma method using human myeloma or mouse-human heteromyeloma cells lines see Kozbor J. Immunol. 133, 3001, (1984) and Brodeur, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp 51-63 (Marcel Dekker Inc, 1987). Alternative methods include the use of phage libraries or transgenic mice both of which utilize human V region repertories (see Winter G, (1994), Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12, 433-455, Green L L (1999), J. Immunol. Methods 231, 11-23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral strains of transgenic mice are now available wherein their mouse immunoglobulin loci has been replaced with human immunoglobulin gene segments (see Tomizuka K, (2000) PNAS 97, 722-727; Fishwild D M (1996) Nature Biotechnol. 14, 845-851. Mendez M J, 1997, Nature Genetics, 15, 146-156). Upon antigen challenge such mice are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies from which antibodies of interest can be selected. Of particular note is the Trimera™ system (see Eren R et al, (1988) Immunology 93:154-161) where human lymphocytes are transplanted into irradiated mice, the Selected Lymphocyte Antibody System (SLAM, see Babcook et al, PNAS (1996) 93: 7843-7848) where human (or other species) lymphocytes are effectively put through a massive pooled in vitro antibody generation procedure followed by deconvulated, limiting dilution and selection procedure and the Xenomouse™ (Abgenix Inc). An alternative approach is available from Morphotek Inc using the Morphodoma™ technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies (and fragments thereof), see McCafferty; Nature, 348, 552-553 (1990) and Griffiths A D et at (1994) EMBO 13: 3245-3260. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat of protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed (usually with the aid of a helper phage) as function antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Selections based on the function properties of the antibody result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting these properties. The phage display technique can be used to select antigen specific antibodies from libraries made from human B cells taken from individuals afflicted with a disease or disorder described above or alternatively from unimmunized human donors (see Marks; J Mol Bio 222, 581-591, 1991). Where an intact human antibody is desired comprising an Fc domain it is necessary redone the phage displayed derived fragment into a mammalian expression vectors comprising the desired constant regions and establishing stable expressing cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe technique of affinity maturation (Marks; Bio/\ntechnol\n 10, 779-783 (1992)) may be used to provide binding affinity wherein the affinity of the primary human antibody is improved by sequentially replacing the H and L chain V regions with naturally occurring variants and selecting on the basis of improved binding affinities. Variants of this technique such as ‘epitope imprinting’ are now also available, see WO 93/06213. See also Waterhouse; Nucl Acids Res 21, 2265-2266 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided an intact therapeutic (human) antibody capable of binding 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibiting the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the intact therapeutic human antibody binds 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2. In typical embodiments the intact therapeutic human antibody comprises a constant region of an IgG isotype, e.g. IgG1 or IgG4.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1.2 Chimaeric and Humanised Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of intact non-human antibodies in the treatment of human diseases or disorders carries with it the potential for the now well established problems of immunogenicity, that is the immune system of the patient may recognises the non-human intact antibody as non-self and mount a neutralising response. This is particularly evident upon multiple administration of the non-human antibody to a human patient. Various techniques have been developed over the years to overcome these problems and generally involve reducing the composition of non-human amino acid sequences in the intact antibody whilst retaining the relative ease in obtaining non-human antibodies from an immunised animal, e.g. mouse, rat or rabbit. Broadly two approaches have been used to achieve this. The first are chimaeric antibodies, which generally comprise a non-human (e.g. rodent such as mouse) variable domain fused to a human constant region. Because the antigen-binding site of an antibody is localised within the variable regions the chimaeric antibody retains its binding affinity for the antigen but acquires the effector functions of the human constant region and are therefore able to perform effector functions such as described supra. Chimaeric antibodies are typically produced using recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the antibodies (e.g. cDNA) is isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the H and L chains of the antibody of the invention, e.g. DNA encoding \n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO\n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 described supra). Hybridoma cells serve as a typical source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA is placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. Coli\n, COS cells, CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain synthesis of the antibody. The DNA may be modified by substituting the coding sequence for human L and H chains for the corresponding non-human (e.g. murine) H and L constant regions see e.g. Morrison; PNAS 81, 6851 (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second approach involves the generation of humanised antibodies wherein the non-human content of the antibody is reduced by humanizing the variable regions. Two techniques for humanisation have gained popularity. The first is humanisation by CDR grafting. CDRs build loops close to the antibody's N-terminus where they form a surface mounted in a scaffold provided by the framework region. Antigen-binding specificity of the antibody is mainly defined by the topography and by the chemical characteristics of its CDR surface. These features are in turn determined by the conformation of the individual CDRs, by the relative disposition of the CDRs, and by the nature and disposition of the side chains of the residues comprising the CDRs. A large decrease in immunogenicity can be achieved by grafting only the CDRs of a non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies (‘donor’ antibodies) onto human framework (‘acceptor framework’) and constant regions (see Jones et al (1986) Nature 321, 522-525 and Verhoeyen M et al (1988) Science 239, 1534-1536). However, CDR grafting per se may not result in the complete retention of antigen-binding properties and it is frequency found that some framework residues (sometimes referred to as ‘backmutations’) of the donor antibody need to be preserved in the humanised compound If significant antigen-binding affinity is to be recovered (see Queen C et al (1989) \nPNAS\n 86, 10, 029-10,033, Co, M et al (1991) Nature 351, 501-502). In this case, human V regions showing the greatest sequence homology to the non-human donor antibody are chosen from a database in order to provide the human framework (FR). The selection of human FRs can be made either from human consensus or individual human antibodies. Where necessary key residues from the donor antibody are substituted into the human acceptor framework to preserve CDR conformations. Computer modelling of the antibody may be used to help identify such structurally important residues, see WO99/48523.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, humanisation may be achieved by a process of ‘veneering’. A statistical analysis of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions revealed that the precise patterns of exposed residues are different in human and murine antibodies, and most individual surface positions have a strong preference for a small number of different residues (see Padlan E A, et al; (1991) \nMol Immunol\n 28, 489-498 and Pedersen J T et al (1994) J Mol Biol 235; 959-973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by replacing exposed residues in its framework regions that differ from those usually found in human antibodies. Because protein antigenicity may be correlated with surface accessibility, replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render the mouse variable region ‘invisible’ to the human immune system (see also Mark G E et al (1994) in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology vol 113: The pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp 105-134). This procedure of humanisation is referred to as ‘veneering’ because only the surface of the antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided an intact therapeutic humanised antibody capable of binding 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibiting the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the intact therapeutic humanised antibody binds 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2. In typical embodiments the intact therapeutic human antibody comprises a constant region of an IgG isotype, e.g. IgG1 or IgG4.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1.3 Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA bispecific antibody is an antibody having binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Methods of making such antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin H chain-L chain pairs, where the two H chains have different binding specificities, (see Millstein et al, Nature 305, 537-539 (1983), WO93/08829 and Traunecker et al, EMBO, 10, 1991, 3655-3659). Because of the random assortment of H and L chains, a potential mixture of ten different antibody structures are produced of which only one has the desired binding specificity. An alternative approach involves fusing the variable domains with the desired binding specificities to heavy chain constant region comprising at least part of the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the CH1 region containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNA encoding these fusions and, if desired, the L chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are the contransfected into a suitable host organism. It is possible though to insert the coding sequences for two or all three chains into one expression vector. In one preferred approach, the bispecific antibody is composed of an H chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and an H-L chain pair, providing a second binding specificity in the other arm, see WO94/04690. Also see Suresh et al, Methods in Enzymology 121, 210, 1986.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention there is provided a bispecific therapeutic antibody wherein at least one binding specificity of said antibody is for 7,25DHC or 7,27DHC or 7HC or 25HC and the second specificity is for EBI2. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the bispecific therapeutic antibody has at least one binding specificity for 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and the second specificity for EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2. In preferred forms the bispecific antibody comprises a primate, e.g. human antibody of a IgG (e.g. IgG1 or IgG4) isotype.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1.4 Antibody Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention there is provided therapeutic antibody fragments which modulate (e.g. inhibit) the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and EBI2. Such fragments may be functional antigen binding fragments of intact and/or humanised chimaeric antibodies such as Fab, Fab′, F(ab\n1\n)\n2\n, Fv, ScFv fragments of the antibodies described supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTraditionally, such fragments are produced by the proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies by e.g. papain digestion (see for example WO 94/29348) but may be produced directly from recombinantly transformed host cells. For the production of ScFv, see Bird et al; (1988) Science, 242, 423-426. In addition, antibody fragments may be produced using a variety of engineering techniques as described below. FV fragments appear to have lower interaction energy of their two chains than Fab fragments. To stabilise the association of the VH and VL domains, they have been linked with peptides (Bird et al, (1988) Science, 242, 423-426, Huston et al, PNAS, 85, 5879-5883), disulphide bridges (Glockshuber et al, (1990) Biochemistry, 29, 1362-1367) and ‘knob in hole’ mutations (Zhu et al (1997), Protein Sci., 6, 781-788). ScFv fragments can be produced by methods well known to those skilled in the art (see Whitlow et al (1991), Methods companion Methods Enzymol, 2, 97-105 and Huston et al (1993) \nInt Rev Immunol\n 10, 195-217. ScFv may be produced in bacterial cells such as \nE. Coli \nbut are more preferably produced in eukaryotic cells. One disadvantage of ScFv is the monovalency of the product, which precludes an increased avidity due to polyvalent binding, and their short half-life. Attempts to overcome these problems include bivalent (ScFv′)\n2 \nproduced from ScFv containing an additional C terminal cysteine by chemical coupling (Adams et al (1993) Can Res 53, 4026-4034 and McCartney et al (1995) Protein Eng, 8, 301-314) or by spontaneous site-specific dimerization of ScFv containing an unpaired C terminal cysteine residue (see Kipriyanov et al (1995) Cell. Biophys 26, 187-204). Alternatively, ScFv can be forced to form multimers by shortening the peptide linker to 3 and 12 residues to form ‘diabodies’ (see Holliger et al PNAS (1993), 90, 6444-6448). Reducing the linker still further can result in ScFV trimers (‘triabodies’, see Kortt et al (1997) Protein Eng, 10, 423-433) and tetramers (‘tetrabodies’, see Le Gall et al (1999) FEBS Lett, 453, 164-168). Construction of bialent ScFV compounds can also be achieved by genetic fusion with protein dimerzing motifs to form ‘miniantibodies’ (see Pack et al (1992) Biochemistry 31, 1579-1584) and ‘minibodies’ (see Hu et al (1996), Cancer Res. 56, 3055-3061). ScFv-Sc-Fv tandems ((ScFV)\n2\n) may also be produced by linking two ScFV units by a third peptide linger, (see Kurucz et al (1995) J Immunol, 154, 4576-4582). Bispecific diabodies can be produced through the noncovalent association of two single chain fusion products consisting of VH domain from one antibody connected by a short linker to the VL domain of another antibody, (see Kipriyanov et al (1998), Int J Can 77, 763-772). The stability of such bispecific diabodies can be enhanced by the introduction of disulphide bridges or ‘knob in hole’ mutations as described supra or by the formation of single chain diabodies (ScDb) wherein two hydrid ScFv fragments are connected through a peptide linker (see Kontermann et al (1999) J Immunol Methods 226, 179-188). Tetravalent bispecific compounds are available by e.g fusing a ScFv fragment to the CH3 domain of an IgG compound or to a Fab fragment through the hinge region (see Coloma et al (1997) Nature Biotechnol, 15, 159-163). Alternatively, tetravalent bispecific compounds have been created by the fusion of bispecific single chain diabodies (see Alt et al (1999) FEBS Lett 454, 90-94). Smaller tetravalent bispecific compounds can also be formed by the dimerization of either ScFv-ScFv tandems with a linker containing a helix-loop-helix motif (DiBi miniantibodies, see Muller et al (1998) FEBS Lett 432, 45-49) or a single chain compound comprising four antibody variable domains (VH and VL) in an orientation preventing intramolecular pairing (tandem diabody, see Kipriyanov et al, (1999) J Mol Biol 293, 41-56). Bispecific F9ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be created by chemical coupling of Fab′ fragments or by heterodimerization through leucine zippers (see Shalaby et al (1992) J Exp Med 175, 217-225 and Kostelny et al (1992), J Immunol 148 1547-1553). Also available are isolated VH and VL domains (Domantis plc), see U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516; U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,158; U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,197 and isolated VHH domain antibodies (Nanobodies). These domain and nanobodies may be dual specific having one specificity directed to a half life extending protein such as human serum albumin (HSA). Such domain and nanobodies both monospecific for a NRG1 protein of the invention and further dual specific for a half life extending protein such as HSA are specifically contemplated by the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment there is provided a therapeutic antibody fragment (e.g. ScFv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n) or an engineered antibody fragment as described supra that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the therapeutic antibody fragment or the engineered antibody fragment binds 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1.5 Heteroconivate Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies also form an embodiment of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies formed using any convenient cross-linking methods. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\n \n4.1.1.1.6 Other Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \nThe interaction between the Fc region of an antibody and various Fc receptors (FcγR) is believed to mediate the effector functions of the antibody which include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), fixation of complement, phagocytosis, and half-life/clearance of the antibody. Various modifications to the Fc region of antibodies of the invention may be carried out depending on the desired property. For example, specific mutations in the Fc region to render an otherwise lytic antibody, non-lytic is detailed in EP 0629 240B1 and Ep 0307 434B2 or one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody to increase serum half-life, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277. There are five currently recognised human Fcγ, FcγR (I), FCγRIIb, FcγRIIIa and neonatal FcRn. Shields et al, (2001) J Biol Chem 276, 6591-6604 demonstrated that a common set of IgG1 residues is involved in binding all FcγRs, while FCγRII and FcγRIII utilize distinct sites outside of this common set. One group of IgG1 residues reduced binding to all FcγRs when altered to alanine: Pro-238, Asp-265, Asp-270, Asn-297 and Pro-239. All are in the IgG CH2 domain and clustered near the hinge joining CH1 and CH2. While FcγRI utilizes only the common set of IgG1 residues for binding, FcγRII and FcγRIII (e.g. Glu-293). Some variants showed improved binding to FcγRII or FcγRIII but did not affect binding to the other receptor (e.g. Ser-267Ala improved binding to FcγRII but binding to FcγRIII was unaffected). Other variants exhibited improved binding to DcγRII or FcγRIII with reduction in binding to the other receptor (e.g. Ser298Ala improved binding to FcγRIII and reduced binding to FcγRII). For FcγRIIIa, the best binding IgG1 variants had combined alanine substitutions at Ser-298, Glu-333 and Ls-334. The neonatal FcRn receptor is believed to be involved in both antibody clearance and the transcytosis across tissues (see Junghans RP (1997) Immunol Res 16, 2957 and Ghetie et al (2000) Annu Rev Immunol 18, 739-766). Human IgG1 residues determined to interact directly with human FcRn included Ile253, Ser254, Lys288, Thr307, Gln311, Asn434 and His435. Switches at any of these positions described in this section may enable increased serum half-life and/or altered effector properties of antibodies of the invention and therefore forms an embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include glycosylation variants of the antibodies of the invention. Glycosylation of antibodies at conserved positions in their constant regions is known to have a profound effect on antibody function, particularly effector functioning such as those described above, see for example, Boyd et al (1996), \nMol Immunol\n 32, 1311-1318. Glycosylation variants of the therapeutic antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof of the present invention wherein one or more carbohydrate moiety is added, substituted, deleted or modified are contemplated. Introduction of an asparagine-X-serin or asparagine-X-threonine motif creates a potential side for enzymatic attachment of carbonhydrate moieties and may therefore be used to manipulate the glycosylation of an antibody. In Raju et al (2001) \nBiochemistry\n 40, 8868-8876 the terminal sialyation of a TNFR-IgG immunoadhesin was increased through a process of regalactosylation and/or resialylation using beta-1,4-galactrosyltransferace and/or alpha, 2, 3 sialyltransferase. Increasing the terminal sialylation is believed to increase the half-life of the immunoglobulin. Antibodies, in common with most glycoproteins, are typically produced as a mixture of glycoforms. This mixture is particularly apparent when antibodies are produced in eukaryotic, particularly mammalian cells. A variety of methods have been developed to manufacture defined glycoforms, see Zhang et al, Science (2004), 303, 371; Sears et al, Science (2001), 291, 2344; Wacker et al (2002), Science 298, 1790; Davis et al (2002), Chem Rev 102, 579; Hang et al (2001), Acc Chem Res 34, 727. Thus the invention contemplates a plurity of therapeutic (monoclonal) antibodies (which may be of the IgG isotype, e,g. IgG1) as herein described comprising a defined number (e.g. 7 or less, for example 5 or less such as two or a single) glycoform(s) or said antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther embodiments of the invention include therapeutic antibodies of the invention or antigen binding fragments thereof coupled to a non-proteinaeous polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylene. Conjugation of proteins to PEG is an established technique for increasing half-life of proteins, as well as reducing antigenicity and immunogenicity of proteins. The use of PEGylation with different molecular weights and styles (linear or branched) has been investigated with intact antibodies as well as Fab′ fragments (see Koumenis I L et al (2000) Int J Pharmaceut 198; 83-95.\n\n\n \n4.2 Adnectins—Compound Therapeutics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe adnectin scaffolds are based on fibronectin type III domain (e.g., the tenth module of the fibronectin type III (10 Fn3 domain). The fibronectin type III domain has 7 or 8 beta strands which are distributed between two beta sheets, which themselves pack against each other to form the core of the protein, and further containing loops (analogous to CDRs) which connect the beta strands to each other and are solvent exposed. There are at least three such loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich, where the edge is the boundary of the protein perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,418).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese fibronectin-based scaffolds are not an immunoglobulin, although the overall fold is closely related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment, the variable region of the heavy chain, which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG. Because of this structure, the non-immunoglobulin antibody mimics antigen binding properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can be used in a loop randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo. These fibronectin-based compounds can be used as scaffolds where the loop regions of the compound can be replaced with CDRs of the invention using standard cloning techniques. Accordingly, in some embodiments there is provided an adnectin compound that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments, the adnectin compound binds with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4.3 Ankyrin—Molecular Partners\n\n\n \n \n \nThis technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as scaffolds for bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The ankyrin repeat module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti-parallel α-helices and a β-turn. Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display. Accordingly, in some embodiments there is provided an Ankyrin compound that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments, the adnectin compound binds with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4.4 Maxybodies/Avimers—Avidia\n\n\n \n \n \nAvimers are derived from natural A-domain containing protein such as LRP-1. These domains are used by nature for protein-protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins are structurally based on A-domains. Avimers consist of a number of different “A-domain” monomers (2-10) linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that can bind to the target antigen using the methodology described in, for example, US20040175756; US20050053973; US20050048512; and US20060008844. Accordingly, in some embodiments there is provided an Maxybody compound that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments, the Maxybody compound binds with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4.5 Protein A—Affibody\n\n\n \n \n \nAffibody® affinity ligands are small, simple proteins composed of a three-helix bundle based on the scaffold of one of the IgG-binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein from the bacterium \nStaphylococcus aureus\n. This scaffold domain consists of 58 amino acids, 13 of which are randomized to generate Affibody® libraries with a large number of ligand variants (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,012). Affibody® compounds mimic antibodies, they have a molecular weight of 6 kDa, compared to the molecular weight of antibodies, which is 150 kDa. In spite of its small size, the binding site of Affibody® compounds is similar to that of an antibody. Accordingly, in some embodiments there is provided an Protein A-affibody compound that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments, the Protein A-affibody compound binds with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4.6 Anticalins—\nPieris \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnticalins® are products developed by the company \nPieris \nProteoLab AG. They are derived from lipocalins, a widespread group of small and robust proteins that are usually involved in the physiological transport or storage of chemically sensitive or insoluble compounds. Several natural lipocalins occur in human tissues or body liquids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein architecture is reminiscent of immunoglobulins, with hypervariable loops on top of a rigid framework. However, in contrast with antibodies or their recombinant fragments, lipocalins are composed of a single polypeptide chain with 160 to 180 amino acid residues, being just marginally bigger than a single immunoglobulin domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe set of four loops, which makes up the binding pocket, shows pronounced structural plasticity and tolerates a variety of side chains. The binding site can thus be reshaped in a proprietary process in order to recognize prescribed target compounds of different shape with high affinity and specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne protein of lipocalin family, the bilin-binding protein (BBP) of \nPieris Brassicae \nhas been used to develop anticalins by mutagenizing the set of four loops. One example of a patent application describing “anticalins” is PCT WO 199916873.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in some embodiments there is provided an anticalin compound that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments, the anticalin compound binds with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4.7 Affilin—Scil Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nAffilin™ compounds are small non-immunoglobulin proteins which are designed for specific affinities towards proteins and small compounds. New Affilin™ compounds can be very quickly selected from two libraries, each of which is based on a different human derived scaffold protein. Affilin™ compounds do not show any structural homology to immunoglobulin proteins. Scil Proteins employs two Affilin™ scaffolds, one of which is gamma crystalline, a human structural eye lens protein and the other is “ubiquitin” superfamily proteins. Both human scaffolds are very small, show high temperature stability and are almost resistant to pH changes and denaturing agents. This high stability is mainly due to the expanded beta sheet structure of the proteins. Examples of gamma crystalline derived proteins are described in WO200104144 and examples of “ubiquitin-like” proteins are described in WO2004106368. Accordingly, in some embodiments there is provided an Affilin compound that binds with 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor. In preferred embodiments, the Affilin compound compound binds with 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and/or EBI2 and inhibits the interaction between ligand and receptor.\n\n\n \n4.7.1 Other Therapeutic Modalities\n\n\n \n \n \nAs noted previously, other therapeutic modalities of the invention include modulators (particularly inhibitors) of EBI2 which exert their effect on their target prior to protein expression. Examples include anti-sense oligonucleotides that comprise (or consist essentially of) a sequence (a) capable of forming a stable triplex with a portion of the EBI2 (particularly NRG1β1) gene, or (b) capable of forming a stable duplex with a portion of an mRNA transcript of the EBI2 gene under physiological conditions. Other examples include molecules that can participate in the phenomena of “RNA interference”. RNA interference (RNAi) is particularly useful for specifically inhibiting the production of a particular protein. Although not wishing to be limited by theory, Waterhouse et al. (1998) have provided a model for the mechanism by which dsRNA (duplex RNA) can be used to reduce protein production. Conveniently, the dsRNA can be produced from a single promoter in a recombinant vector or host cell, where the sense and anti-sense sequences are flanked by an unrelated sequence which enables the sense and anti-sense sequences to hybridise to form the dsRNA molecule with the unrelated sequence forming a loop structure. The design and production of suitable dsRNA molecules for the present invention is well within the capacity of a person skilled in the art, particularly considering Waterhouse et al. (1998), Smith et al. (2000), WO 99/32619, WO 99/53050, WO 99/49029, and WO 01/34815.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a DNA is introduced that directs the synthesis of an at least partly double stranded RNA product(s) with homology to the target gene to be inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA therefore comprises both sense and antisense sequences that, when transcribed into RNA, can hybridise to form the double-stranded RNA region. In a preferred embodiment, the sense and antisense sequences are separated by a spacer region that comprises an intron which, when transcribed into RNA, is spliced out. This arrangement has been shown to result in a higher efficiency of gene silencing. The double-stranded region may comprise one or two RNA molecules, transcribed from either one DNA region or two. The presence of the double stranded molecule is thought to trigger a response from an endogenous mammalian system that destroys both the double stranded RNA and also the homologous RNA transcript from the target mammalian gene, efficiently reducing or eliminating the activity of the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe length of the sense and antisense sequences that hybridise should each be at least 19 contiguous nucleotides, preferably at least 30 or 50 nucleotides, and more preferably at least 100, 200, 500 or 1000 nucleotides. The full-length sequence corresponding to the entire gene transcript may be used. The lengths are most preferably 100-2000 nucleotides. The degree of identity of the sense and antisense sequences to the targeted transcript should be at least 85%, preferably at least 90% and more preferably 95-100%. The RNA molecule may of course comprise unrelated sequences which may function to stabilise the molecule. The RNA molecule may be expressed under the control of a RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase HI promoter. Examples of the latter include tRNA or snRNA promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred small interfering RNA (“siRNA”) molecules comprise a nucleotide sequence that is identical to about 19-21 contiguous nucleotides of the target mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the siRNA sequence commences with the dinucleotide AA, comprises a GC-content of about 30-70% (preferably, 30-60%, more preferably 40-60% and more preferably about 45%-55%), and does not have a high percentage identity to any nucleotide sequence other than the target in the genome of the mammal in which it is to be introduced, for example as determined by standard BLAST search.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroRNA regulation is a clearly specialised branch of the RNA silencing pathway that evolved towards gene regulation, diverging from conventional RNAi/PTGS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroRNAs are a specific class of small RNAs that are encoded in gene-like elements organised in a characteristic inverted repeat. When transcribed, microRNA genes give rise to stem-looped precursor RNAs from which the microRNAs are subsequently processed. MicroRNAs are typically about 2 1 nucleotides in length. The released miRNAs are incorporated into RISC-like complexes containing a particular subset of Argonaute proteins that exert sequence-specific gene repression (see, for example, Millar and Waterhouse, 2005; Pasquinelli et al. 2005; Almeida and Allshire, 2005).\n\n\n \n4.8 Production Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic proteins of the invention, and particularly antibodies maybe produced as a polyclonal population but are more preferably produced as a monoclonal population (that is as a substantially homogenous population of identical antibodies directed against a specific antigenic binding site). It will of course be apparent to those skilled in the art that a population implies more than one antibody entity. Antibodies of the present invention may be produced in transgenic organisms such as goats (see Pollock et al (1999), J. Immunol. Methods 231:147-157), chickens (see Morrow K J J (2000) Genet. Eng. News 20:1-55, mice (see Pollock et al) or plants (see Doran P M, (2000) Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 11, 199-204, Ma JK-C (1998), Nat. Med. 4; 601-606, Baez J e. al, BioPharm (2000) 13: 50-54, Stoger E et al; (2000) Plant Mol. Biol. 42:583-590). Antibodies may also be produced by chemical synthesis. However, antibodies and other therapeutic proteins of the invention are typically produced using recombinant cell culturing technology well known to those skilled in the art. A polynucleotide encoding the antibody is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector such as a plasmid for further cloning (amplification) or expression. One useful expression system is a glutamate synthetase system (such as sold by Lonza Biologies), particularly where the host cell is CHO or NSO (see below). Polynucleotide encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. oligonucleotide probes). Vectors that may be used include plasmid, virus, phage, transposons, minichromsomes of which plasmids are a typical embodiment. Generally such vectors further include a signal sequence, origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter and transcription termination sequences operably linked to the light and/or heavy chain polynucleotide so as to facilitate expression. Polynucleotide encoding the light and heavy chains may be inserted into separate vectors and transfected into the same host cell or, if desired both the heavy chain and light chain can be inserted into the same vector for transfection into the host cell. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of constructing a vector encoding the light and/or heavy chains of a therapeutic antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the invention, which method comprises inserting into a vector, a polynucleotide encoding either a light chain and/or heavy chain of a therapeutic antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n4.8.1 Signal Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention maybe produced as a fusion protein with a heterologous signal sequence having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein. The signal sequence should be recognised and processed by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells, the signal sequence may be an alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, or heat stable enterotoxin I1 leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequences may be a yeast invertase leader, [alpha] factor leader or acid phosphatase leaders see e.g. WO90/13646. In mammalian cell systems, viral secretory leaders such as herpes simplex gD signal and a native immunoglobulin signal sequence are available. Typically the signal sequence is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n4.8.2 Origin of Replication\n\n\n \n \n \nOrigin of replications are well known in the art with pBR322 suitable for most gram-negative bacteria, 2μ plasmid for most yeast and various viral origins such as SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV for most mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors but the SV40 may be used since it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n \n4.8.3 Selection Marker\n\n\n \n \n \nTypical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline or (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies or supply nutrients not available in the complex media. The selection scheme may involve arresting growth of the host cell. Cells, which have been successfully transformed with the genes encoding the therapeutic antibody of the present invention, survive due to e.g. drug resistance conferred by the selection marker. Another example is the so-called DHFR selection marker wherein transformants are cultured in the presence of methotrexate. In typical embodiments, cells are cultured in the presence of increasing amounts of methotrexate to amplify the copy number of the exogenous gene of interest. CHO cells are a particularly useful cell line for the DHFR selection. A further example is the glutamate synthetase expression system (Lonza Biologies). A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene, see Stinchcomb et \nal Nature\n 282, 38, 1979.\n\n\n \n4.8.4 Promoters\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable promoters for expressing antibodies of the invention are operably linked to DNA/polynucleotide encoding the antibody. Promoters for prokaryotic hosts include phoA promoter, Beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, tryptophan and hybrid promoters such as Tac. Promoters suitable for expression in yeast cells include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes e.g. enolase, \nglyceralderhyde\n 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, \nglucose\n 6 phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase and glucokinase. Inducible yeast promoters include \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, metallothionein and enzymes responsible for nitrogen metabolism or maltose/galactose utilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters for expression in mammalian cell systems include viral promoters such as polyoma, fowlpox and adenoviruses (e.g. adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus (in particular the immediate early gene promoter), retrovirus, hepatitis B virus, actin, rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter and the early or \nlate Simian virus\n 40. Of course the choice of promoter is based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression.\n\n\n \n4.8.5 Enhancer Element\n\n\n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, e.g. for expression in higher eukaroytics, an enhancer element operably linked to the promoter element in a vector may be used. Suitable mammalian enhancer sequences include enhancer elements from globin, elastase, albumin, fetoprotein and insulin. Alternatively, one may use an enhancer element from a eukaroytic cell virus such as SV40 enhancer (at bp 100-270), cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, polyma enhancer, baculoviral enhancer or murine IgG2a locus (see WO04/009823). The enhancer is preferably located on the vector at a site upstream to the promoter.\n\n\n \n4.8.6 Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing vectors encoding antibodies of the invention are prokaroytic, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotic cells include eubacteria e.g. enterobacteriaceae such as \nEscherichia \ne.g. \nE. Coli \n(for example ATCC 31, 446; 31, 537; 27,325), \nEnterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella Proteus, Salmonella \ne.g. \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia \ne.g. \nSerratia marcescans \nand \nShigella \nas well as \nBacilli \nsuch as \nB. subtilis \nand \nB. lichenifonnis \n(see DD 266 710), \nPseudomonas \nsuch as \nP. aeruginosa \nand \nStreptomyces\n. Of the yeast host cells, \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces \n(e.g. ATCC 16,045; 12,424; 24178; 56,500), \nyarrowia \n(EP402, 226), \nPichia Pastoris \n(EP183, 070, see also Peng et al J. Biotechnol. 108 (2004) 185-192), \nCandida, Thchoderma reesia \n(EP244, 234J, Penicillin, \nTolypocladium \nand \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \nand \nA. niger \nare also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough Prokaryotic and yeast host cells are specifically contemplated by the invention, preferably however, host cells of the present invention are higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable higher eukaryotic host cells include mammalian cells such as COS-1 (ATCC No. CRL 1650) COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651), human embryonic kidney line 293, baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) (ATCC CRL1632), BHK570 (ATCC NO: CRL 10314), 293 (ATCC NO. CRL 1573), Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO (e.g. CHO-K1, ATCC NO: CCL 61, DHFR-CHO cell line such as DG44 (see Urlaub et al., (1986) Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 12, 555-556)), particularly those CHO cell lines adapted for suspension culture, mouse Sertoli cells, monkey kidney cells, African green monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1587), HELA cells, canine kidney cells (ATCC CCL 34), human lung cells (ATCC CCL 75), Hep G2 and myeloma or lymphoma cells e.g. NSO (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Sp2/0, YO. Thus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided a stably transformed host cell comprising a vector encoding a heavy chain and/or light chain of the therapeutic antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof as herein described. Preferably such host cells comprise a first vector encoding the light chain and a second vector encoding said heavy chain.\n\n\n \n4.6.1 Bacterial Fermentation\n\n\n \n \n \nBacterial systems may be used for the expression of non-immunoglobulin therapeutic proteins described above. Bacterial systems are also particularly suited for the expression of antibody fragments. Such fragments are localised intracellular or within the periplasma. Insoluble periplasmic proteins can be extracted and refolded to form active proteins according to methods known to those skilled in the art, see Sanchez et al (1999) J. Biotechnol. 72, 13-20 and Cu pit PM et al (1999) Lett Appl Microbiol, 29, 273-277.\n\n\n \n4.8.7 Cell Culturing Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nHost cells transformed with vectors encoding the therapeutic antibodies of the invention or antigen binding fragments thereof may be cultured by any method known to those skilled in the art. Host cells may be cultured in spinner flasks, roller bottles or hollow fibre systems but it is preferred for large scale production that stirred tank reactors are used particularly for suspension cultures. Preferably the stirred tankers are adapted for aeration using e.g. spargers, baffles or low shear impellers. For bubble columns and airlift reactors direct aeration with air or oxygen bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells are cultured in a serum free culture media it is preferred that the media is supplemented with a cell protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to help prevent cell damage as a result of the aeration process. Depending on the host cell characteristics, either microcarriers maybe used as growth substrates for anchorage dependent cell lines or the cells maybe adapted to suspension culture (which is typical). The culturing of host cells, particularly invertebrate host cells may utilise a variety of operational modes such as fed-batch, repeated batch processing (see Drapeau et al (1994) cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch process or perfusion culture. Although recombinantly transformed mammalian host cells may be cultured in serum-containing media such as fetal calf serum (FCS), it is preferred that such host cells are cultured in synthetic serum-free media such as disclosed in Keen et al (1995) Cytotechnology 17:153-163, or commercially available media such as ProCHO-CDM or UltraCHO™ (Cambrex N.J., USA), supplemented where necessary with an energy source such as glucose and synthetic growth factors such as recombinant insulin. The serum-free culturing of host cells may require that those cells are adapted to grow in serum free conditions. One adaptation approach is to culture such host cells in serum containing media and repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for the serum-free media so that the host cells learn to adapt in serum free conditions (see e.g. Scharfenberg K et al (1995) in Animal Cell technology: Developments towards the 21st century (Beuvery E. G. et al eds), pp 619-623, Kluwer Academic publishers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or other therapeutic proteins of the invention secreted into the media may be recovered and purified using a variety of techniques to provide a degree of purification suitable for the intended use. For example the use of therapeutic antibodies of the invention for the treatment of human patients typically mandates at least 95% purity, more typically 98% or 99% or greater purity (compared to the crude culture medium). In the first instance, cell debris from the culture media is typically removed using centrifugation followed by a clarification step of the supernatant using e.g. microfiltration, ultrafiltration and/or depth filtration. A variety of other techniques such as dialysis and gel electrophoresis and chromatographic techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA), affinity chromatography (optionally involving an affinity tagging system such as polyhistidine) and/or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,746) are available. In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention, following various clarification steps, are captured using Protein A or G affinity chromatography followed by further chromatography steps such as ion exchange and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size exclusion chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation. Typically, various virus removal steps are also employed (e.g. nanofiltration using e.g. a DV-20 filter). Following these various steps, a purified (preferably monoclonal) preparation comprising at least 75 mg/ml or greater e.g. 100 mg/ml or greater of the antibody of the invention or antigen binding fragment thereof is provided and therefore forms an embodiment of the invention. Suitably such preparations are substantially free of aggregated forms of antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n4.9 Screening Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn other embodiments there is provided a method of/for identifying modulators of the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2. Such method generally comprise bringing into \ncontact\n 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC in the presence of a candidate compound and observing a modulation (such as inhibition) of the interaction between either or both of the \nligands\n 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2 compared to the same experiments in absence of the candidate compound. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the ligands are 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC. Candidate compounds that exhibit inhibition characteristics may be further structurally modified to improve IC50 against its target entity and/or improve toxicity profile prior to formulation and administering to a human patient in clinical need thereof.\n\n\n \n4.10 Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the therapeutic protein or low molecular weight chemical entity formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions can additionally contain other therapeutic agents that are suitable for treating or preventing a human disease or disorder noted below. Pharmaceutically carriers enhance or stabilize the composition, or to facilitate preparation of the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. The route and/or mode of administration vary depending upon the desired results. It is preferred that administration be intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous, or administered proximal to the site of the target. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier should be suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound (particularly low molecular weight chemical entities) may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition should be sterile and fluid. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by use of coating such as lecithin, by maintenance of required particle size in the case of dispersion and by use of surfactants. In many cases, it is preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the composition. Long-term absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared in accordance with methods well known and routinely practiced in the art. See, e.g., Remington: \nThe Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, Mack Publishing Co., 20\nth \ned., 2000; and \nSustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems\n, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. Pharmaceutical compositions are preferably manufactured under GMP conditions. Typically, a therapeutically effective dose or efficacious dose of the modulator of NRG1 (e.g. NRG1β1) such as a NRG1β1 antibody described herein is employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. They are typically formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level depends upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA physician or veterinarian can start doses of the antibodies of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, effective doses of the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of an allergic inflammatory disorder described herein vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Treatment dosages need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. For administration with an antibody, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody and other protein therapeutics are usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be weekly, monthly or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of therapeutic protein in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of 1-1000 μg/ml and in some methods 25-300 μg/ml. Alternatively, antibody or other protein therapeutics can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody or other protein therapeutic in the patient. In general, humanized antibodies show longer half life than that of chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a modulator of the interaction between 7,25DHC and/or 7,27DHC and/or 7HC and/or 25HC and EBI2 together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In a preferred embodiment, pharmaceutical composition comprising a modulator of the interaction between 7a,25DHC and/or 7b,25DHC and/or 7a,27DHC and/or 7b,27DHC and/or 7aHC and/or 7bHC and/or 25HC and EBI2.

Invest\n 105, 803-811) was used to verify stable plasma membrane expression of hEBI2 in recombinant CHO cells using flow cytometry (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \n \n5.3 Human EBI2 siRNA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree different siRNA oligonucleotide sequences specific for hEBI2 were developed and validated (Table 2). The ‘silencing’ action of these siRNA on hEBI2 gene expression was validated after siRNA transient transfection in hEBI2-CHO-Aeq cells, using flow cytometry. A significant decrease of hEBI2 receptor expression at the cell surface is observed after cells treatment with hEBI2 siRNA (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhEBI2 specific siRNA oligonucleotide sequences\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsiRNA\n \nreceptor\n \nsiRNA sequence (5′-3′)\n \nSEQ.I.D.NO:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \nEBI2\n \n \nGAAGCUUCGUUUCUCUAAU\n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\n \n \nEBI2\n \n \nGCAGGAGGCUGAAAGGAUU\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nEBI2\n \n \nGUCAGUGUAUCGAUUUCUA\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \nCtrl\n \n \nCAUGCUAUCUGCCAGAAAU\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5.4 Specific Activation of hEBI2 with Fractions from Human Septic Liver Extract\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhEBI2 CHO-Aeq cell lines were screened in a luminescent aequorin functional assay against proprietary libraries of natural ligands and collection of tissue extracts. We identified specific activation of hEBI2 with fractions from a human septic liver (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe detailed activation profile of EBI2 against this pathological liver extract displayed three activity peaks eluted within 48%, 50% et 60% acetonitrile, respectively. These ‘biological activities’ could be identified in pathological liver conditions (sepsis) but normal liver extracts did not activate EBI2.\n\n\n \n \n5.5 Specificity of EBI2 Activation with Human Liver Extract\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBefore initiating the purification of hEBI2 ligand from liver tissue extracts, it was necessary to confirm the specificity of hEBI2 activation and discriminate it from any putative CHO cells endogenous response. To this aim, we selectively down-regulated the expression of hEBI2 gene with the use of specific hEBI2 siRNA oligonucleotide sequences. We observed a consecutive decrease of EBI2 activation with human liver extract upon transient transfection of hEBI2 siRNAs (SeqIDs as shown in Table 2) in hEBI2-CHO-AeqGqi5 cells (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \nPhysico-Chemical Properties and Molecular Size of Ebi2 Ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \nEBI2 specific ‘activity’ did not decrease after treatment with proteinase K suggesting that EBI2 ligand is not a peptide (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\n \nMolecular Size of Ebi2 Ligand\n\n\n \n \n \nMolecular size of EBI2 ligand was estimated using active liver fractions and size exclusion chromatography. Estimated size for EBI2 ligand was around 400 Daltons (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\n \nMS Analysis of Active Human Liver Fractions\n\n\n \n \n \n1-LC-MS analyses of active human liver fractions were performed on a Waters HPLC (Ultra Pressure Liquid Chromatography) coupled to a Quattro Premier XE mass spectrometer and on a Waters HPLC coupled to a LCT mass spectrometer in order to determine the exact mass of EBI2 ligand. Due, probably, to low amounts of the entity, no overall clear result was obtained.\n\n\n \n \n5.6 Purification of EBI2 L\n2 \nand from Human Septic Liver\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to concentrate and isolate EBI2 ligand from human pathological liver tissue, we tested 8 livers from human sepsis. 2 livers out of 8 displayed significant activation of EBI2. We extracted 1.8 kg human septic liver using the following procedure: Liver tissue was homogenized within 7 volumes of a mixture of methanol-water-acetic acid (90:9:1). After 30 min centrifugation (10,000 g, 4° C.), supernatant was filtered on Whatman paper. Filtrate was then diluted 3 times with water+0.1% TFA. Extract was loaded on a Delta Pak C18 column (400×40 mm) and the column was washed with 20% MeCN+0.1% TFA. Elution was performed with 80% MeCN+0.1% TFA, 100 mL/min. Then we performed several HPLC fractionation of this extract in order to purify the biological entity responsible for EBI2 activation (see \nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \n \n5.7 Specific Activation of hEBI2 with a Sheep Septic Liver Extract\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to overcome the limitation of human tissue availability, we investigated several sepsis animal models as potential source of ‘active’ material. We detected specific activation of EBI2 with a liver extract from a peritonitis sheep sepsis model (\nFIG. 8\n). Sheep liver from peritonitis sepsis model was thus considered as an additional source of material for the purification of EBI2 ligand.\n\n\n \n \n5.8 Purification of EBI2 Ligand from Sheep Sepsis Liver\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince identification of EBI2 ligand purified from human sepsis liver tissue was unsuccessful (mainly explained by low recovery of active material), we initiated purification of EBI2 ligand from sheep sepsis liver, since we previously confirmed specific activation of hEBI2 receptor with liver extract originated from a sheep sepsis model.\n\n\n \nExtraction and Purification Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo kilograms of sheep liver were extracted and fractionated following 6 steps of liquid chromatography. We obtained pure fractions which potently activated hEBI2 receptor (\nFIGS. 9A-F\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver tissue was homogenized within 7 volumes of a mixture of methanol-water-acetic acid (90:9:1). After a 30 min centrifugation (10,000 g, 4° C.), the supernatant was filtered on Whatman paper. Filtrate was then diluted 3 times with water+0.1% TFA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extract was loaded on a Delta Pak C18 column (400×40 mm) and the column washed with 20% MeCN+0.1% TFA. Elution was performed with 80% MeCN+0.1% TFA, 100 mL/min.\n\n\n \n1\nst \nHPLC Separation:\n\n\n \n \n \nColumn: 19×150 mm C18-300 Symmetry, 5 g Waters; 19 mL//min Gradient from 50 to 65% MeCN+0.1% TFA.\n\n\n \n2\nnd \nHPLC Separation Column:\n\n\n \n \n \n7.75×250 mm C8-300, 5μ, ACE, 3 mL/min Active fraction from the first LC separation is diluted 2 times with 0.1% TFA and loaded on the column.

Elution gradient: 26 to 31% MeCN-\nammonium acetate\n 10 mM (9:1) at 0.1%/min.\n\n\n \n5.9 Identification of EBI2 Ligand(s) in Sheep Septic Liver Extract\n\n\nIdentification of EBI2 Ligand: MS Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n1—A first set of MS analyses of the active samples (step 5) did not succeed in revealing a candidate mass for the EBI2 ligand, probably because of low amounts of pure molecule. Several contaminants were present in the samples, hindering identification of specific signals. In addition, no clear differences could be detected between active and control samples\n\n\n2—An additional HPLC purification step of the samples from \nstep\n 5 was performed (step 6). Prior to MS analysis, the samples were concentrated and cleaned using C18 Zip-Tips. The final elution was with 80% ACN+10 mM ammonium acetate. The eluted samples were injected directly to an Orbitrap MS (Thermo) equipped with a NanoMate (Advion) device. MS analysis of the active fractions showed four peaks with significant intensities in both step 5 (Active 1) and step 6 (Active 2), which were negligible in control samples. Ions with masses m/z 383.3303, 401.3408, 441.3332 were observed in positive ion mode, while m/z 477.3582 was observed in negative ion mode (\nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\n\n \nHypothesis:\n\n\nPositive Mode:\n\n\n \n \n \n441.3332=>[C27H46O3Na1]\n+ \n(mass accuracy in ppm: −1.5)\n\n\n401.3408=>[C27H45O2]\n+ \n(−1.5 ppm)\n\n\n383.3303=>[C27H43O1]\n+ \n(−1.5 ppm)\n\n\n\n \nNegative Mode:\n\n\n \n \n \n477.3582 [C29HS50O5]\n+ \n(+1.5 ppm)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour elemental compositions were obtained with good mass accuracy from four common ion signals detected in both active fractions. The ion corresponding to mass m/z 441.3332 could be assigned to the sodium adduct of the molecule C27H46O3 (M), while mass m/z 477.3582 to the acetate (CH\n3\nCOO\n−\n or OAc) adduct of M. Furthermore, the ions with masses 401.3408 and 383.3303 could be assigned to a single and double loss of water, respectively, from the protonated molecular ion. The resulting hypothesis is therefore that the compound M=C27H46O3 with a theoretical mass that of 418.3447 was detected as: [M+Na]\n+\n, [M+H−H2O]\n+\n and [M+H−2H2O]\n+\n in positive ion mode, and [M+OAc]\n−\n in negative ion mode. Neither protonated [M+H]\n+\n nor deprotonated [M−H]\n−\n ions were detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, MS/MS experiments were performed with the active fractions on the four masses. No fragments were obtained from m/z 441.3332 and 477.3582, giving credit to the hypothesis that these correspond to the sodium and acetate adducts, respectively. This is because the gas-phase collision induced dissociation leads predominantly the detachment of sodium or acetate ion instead of fragmenting the molecule. Both Na\n+\n and OAc\n−\n ions could not be detected due to “low mass cutoff” (instrument specific) in the MS/MS experiments. Few fragments were obtained by MS/MS of m/z 383.3303. Among them, one water loss at m/z 365.3205 (0.7 ppm) was detected. No further structure assignment was attempted on the fragments of m/z 383.3303. No MS/MS was performed on m/z 401.3408 due to its low intensity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDatabase query of mass 418.3447 provided mainly oxidized cholesterol (oxysterols) or vitamin D derivatives.

Such prioritization list was established from cholesterol derivatives identified as intermediates in the cholesterol metabolism pathway and from known vitamin D derivatives. This list contained 12 cholesterol derivatives and 5 vitamin D derivatives with C\n27\nH46O3 molecular formula (mass 418.3447)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3 oxysterol and 3 vitamin D3 compounds were tested for EBI2 activation in an aequorin assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong these candidate molecules two related oxysterols, cholest-5-ene-3b, 7b, 25-triol (7b,25DHC), depicted by the compound of Structure I and cholest-5ene-3b, 7b-diol (7bHC), depicted by the compound of Structure II induced specific activation of EBI2 receptor with EC50 values close to 50 nM and 15 μM respectively, while cholest-5-ene-7-methoxy,3b-ol, depicted by the compound of Structure III did not activate EBI2 (\nFIG. 11\n), underscoring the relevance of the alcohol groups and their position in structure-activity relationship.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n5.10 Confirmation of Specific EBI2 Activation with Cholesterol Derived Ligand in CHO and HEK Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe demonstrated that cholest-5-ene-3b,7b, 25-triol (7b,25DHC) specifically and selectively activates hEBI2 compared to WT CHO-AeqGqi5 cells and unrelated GPCRs such as orphans HCR and GPR23 (\nFIGS. 12 and 14\n). We also confirmed activation of hEBI2 by 7b,25DHC in different CHO-Aeq cell backgrounds (Gqi5 and Gα16 (=WTA11)) (\nFIG. 14\n). In addition we demonstrated activation of mouse EBI2 receptor with 7b,25DHC (\nFIGS. 13 and 14\n). Finally, we confirmed activation of hEBI2 by 7b,25DHC with hEBi2-HEK-Aeq Gα16 cells (pCAeqG9) and hEBi2 transiently transfected in HEK T cells (data not shown).\n\n\n \n5.11 MS of 7,25-OHC Standard Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nSynthesized standard samples 7a25-OHC and 7b25-OHC were analysed with the same MS methods as described in 5.9. At relatively low concentration, only [M+Na]\n+\n m/z 441.3338 (0.3 ppm), [M+H−H20]\n+\n m/z 401.34140 (0.5 ppm) and [M+H−2H2O]\n+\n m/z 383.33084 (0.01 ppm) were detected in positive ion mode, and [M+OAc]\n−\n m/z 477.3585 (0.2 ppm) in negative ion mode in the presence of ammonium acetate. No protonated and deprotonated signals were detected. These observations are consistent with those obtained from the active fractions.\n\n\n \n5.12 Conclusion\n\n\n \n \n \nWe purified EBI2 natural ligand from sheep liver obtained from a peritonitis sepsis model. Although EBI2 activation was initially detected in a human septic liver extract, human pathological material was difficult to obtain and purification of EBI2 ligand from 1.8 kg of human septic liver did not enable us to isolate sufficient amounts of active entity to be detected by MS analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMass spectrometry analysis on purified sheep liver active fractions, resulted in the identification of a candidate mass 418.3447 and an associated molecular formula C\n27\nH46O3. Compounds displaying such features are corresponding essentially to cholesterol or vitamin D derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing candidate selection and screening for hEBI2 activation (aequorin assay), we identified cholest-5-ene-3b,7b,25-triol (7,25-dihydroxycholesterol) (“7b,25DHC″) and cholest-5-ene-3b,7b-diol (7-hydroxycholesterol) (“7bHC”) as two active ligands at hEBI2. Cholest-5-ene-3b,7b, 25-triol potently activated hEBI2 with EC50 value around 50 nM and displayed an efficacy greater than 100% compared to the ATP response (endogenous P2Y receptors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecificity and selectivity of cholest-5-ene-3b,7b, 25-triol for hEBI2 was demonstrated compared to WT CHO-Aeq cells and unrelated GPCRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivation of hEBI2 with cholest-5-ene-3b,7b, 25-triol was demonstrated in CHO-K1 cells and HEK293 cells.\n\n\n \n5.13 Pharmacological Profile of Oxysterols at the EBI2 Receptor\n\n\n \n \n \nOnce we demonstrated activity for 7b,25DHC and 7bHC at the EBI2 receptor we set out to determine which is the most likely active compound in vivo. 7b,25DHC is not a compound naturally produced by an enzymatic reaction, but rather is a product of auto-oxidation under specific conditions. We conducted, therefore, a pharmacological characterization of the oxysterols/EBI2 interaction.\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\nCompounds:\n\n\n \n \n \n7a,25DHC(CAS No. 64907-22-8) and 7b,25DHC (CAS No. 64907-21-7) were synthesized from the 7-keto precursor as described below. 7a,27DHC (CAS No. 144300-24-3), 7b,27DHC (CAS No. 240129-43-5) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, A L, USA). 7aHC (CAS No. 566-26-7) was batch synthesized in house. 7bHC (CAS No. 566-27-8), 25HC (CAS No. 2140-46-7), and cholesterol (CAS No. 57-88-5) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland).\n\n\n \nCompound Preparation\n\n\n \n \n \nIf not stated otherwise compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO or ethanol (cholesterol, 25MDC). Serial dilutions were carried out in 90% DMSO (FLIPR, GTPgS) or assay buffer (binding assay). For cell based assays final DMSO concentrations is kept below 1%. In order to prevent adsorption of hydrophobic compounds to the assay plates 0.1% (2-hydroxypropyl)-βcyclodextrin (Aldrich, #33259-3) is added.\n\n\n \nCell Line\n\n\n \n \n \nIf not stated otherwise, the same Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line called E2 which was used for the ligand identification was used in these experiments. This cell line is expressing (1) the recombinant human EBI2 receptor, (2) the promiscuous Gqi5 protein as well as (3) apo-aequorin.\n\n\n \nFLIPR\n\n\n \n \n \nCells were seeded in black/clear bottom, poly-D-Lysine coated 384-well plates at a cell density of 10,000 cells/25 μL/well, using culture medium. Cells were cultured for 24 hours at 37° C./5% CO\n2\n. Culture medium was removed and for cell loading, 20 μl per well of loading buffer (Calcium-4 no wash dye) were distributed into the wells and the plates were incubated for 60 min at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n. With the FLIPR pipettor, 10 μl of the different compounds were added to the cells and the subsequent fluorescent changes monitored for 3 minutes. Using the FLIPR software tool, 2 values of fluorescence calcium responses were exported: Fmax, the fluorescence at the peak and Fbasal corresponding to the value prior to compound injection. From these two values, the calcium response is normalized with respect to the calcium baseline values using dF/F=(Fmax−Fbasal)/Fbasal. The maximum dF/F is called Emax.\n\n\n \nMembranes Preparation\n\n\n \n \n \nCHO cells stably expressing human EBI2 (E2) were grown in roller bottles (Corning #431191) to confluency, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) once and frozen at −80° C. The frozen cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 ml/gram, 20 mM Tris pH7.2) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete™, Roche, # 05 056 489 001-14302200). The cell suspension was then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes) with a driller. After centrifugation at 110000×g for 45 minutes and removal of the supernatant, pellets were resuspended in sucrose buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.2, 250 mM sucrose, 10% glycerol) by vortexing. The suspension was again homogenize using a Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes) and spun at 100000×g for 45 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet resuspended in sucrose buffer, protein concentration determined, aliquoted and frozen at −80° C. These membrane preparations were used in binding as well as GTPgS assays.\n\n\n \nGTPγS Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nReaction were carried out in 96 well plates (OptiPlates™, Perkin Elmer #6005299). Ten micrograms of EBI2 membranes are dissolved in 40 μl of buffer A (20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, \nSaponin\n 10 μg/ml) supplemented with 10 μM GDP. After addition of 20 μA scintilation proximity assay (SPA) beads (100 μg/well, Amersham, RPNQ0001) components are gently mixed and incubated at RT for 15 minutes. Twenty microliters of compound diluted in buffer A and 20 μl of GTPγ\n35\nS (Perkin Elmer NEG030X) is added before incubation for one hour at RT. Plates are transferred and counted in a TopCount (Perkin Elmer NXT HTS™) and counts are analysed plotted and to determine half maximal concentrations of activation using standard software (Prism™, GraphPad Software Inc.).\n\n\n \nBinding Assay\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\n \n \n \nLyophilized wheat germ agglutinin scintilation proximity assay (SPA) beads (RPNQ0001) were purchased from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, UK). One vial (500 mg) is reconstituted by adding 5 mL of distilled water to give a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. Reconstituted SPA beads must be stored at 4° C., but must not be frozen. [3H]-7a,25-OHC, was synthesized by reduction of the 7-keto, 25DHC in the presence of 3H-L-selectride. This protocol yields equal amounts of 7a,25DHC and 7b,25-OHC (see below). [3H]-7a,25DHC used in this experiment was Batch RSE 436-2 with a specific activity of 1024 GBq/mmol) and stored at −20° C. EBI2384-well plates (Cat. No. 6007290, white polystyrene, flat square bottom) were purchased from Perkin Elmer (Boston, USA).\n\n\n \n \nSynthesis of \nradiolabeled\n 7,25DHC\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn a tritiation line, an evacuated, two-necked flask (V=2 mL) was set under \n3\nH\n2 \n(99%\n3\nH\n2\n, 179.25 mmol, p=728 mbar) at 296K, Subsequently, butyl-lithium in hexane (160 μmol, 100 μL, c=1.6M) and tetramethylethylenediamine (200 μmol, 30 μL) was added. After 55′, the suspension was cooled with liquid N\n2\n, the excess of \n3\nH\n2 \nwas taken back to the waste reservoir and the solvent was evaporated. Then, the residue was set under N\n2\n, THF (5004) was added, the suspension was diluted with sec-butyl-borane in THF (160 μmol, 160 μL, c=1M) and cooled to −90° C. At this temperature, a solution of 1 (24 μmol, 10 mg) in THF (500 μL) was added within 1′ and the reaction mixture was stirred for 90′, while the temperature was raised slowly form −80° C. to −50° C. After this time, acetone (1504) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for further 90′, while the temperature was raised slowly form −50° C. to −8° C. At the end, the reaction mixture was quenched with 1.0N NaOH (250 μL) and 30% H\n2\nO\n2 \n(250 μL) and stirred for 15′ at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequently, the reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, evaporated to dryness and co-evaporated with ethanol (4×1 mL). The residue was filtered over a pad of SiO\n2 \n(1 g) and the product was eluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/MeOH 95:5 in order to yield 851 MBq of a mixture of 2 and 3 (dissolved in 14 mL ethanol; α-isomer/β-isomer=58:42), which was separated by preparative reversed phase HPLC on MN Nucleodur Sphinx RP (5 μm, 8×150 mm, T=20° C., λ=210 nm; eluent A: water+0.1% TFA; eluent B: CH3CN+0.1% TFA). Thus, two enriched fractions of 2 (59.94 MBq, α-isomer/β-isomer=70:30) and 3 (108.04 MBq, α-isomer/β-isomer=38:62) were obtained, each after extraction on solid support StrataX (2×100 mg). The enriched, pre-purified fractions were further purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC on Water's SunFire C18 (5 μm, 10×250 mm, T=40° C., λ=210 nm; eluent A: H\n2\nO/MeOH=95:5; eluent B: H\n2\nO/MeOH=5:95) in order to yield 50.6 MBq of diastereomerically pure 2 (α-isomer/β-isomer=99.9:0.1) and 51.4 MBq of diastereomerically pure 3 (α-isomer/β-isomer=0.1:99.9).\n\n\n \nK\nD \nDetermination\n\n\n \n \n \nThe K\nD \ndetermination was performed using a fixed concentration of membranes and beads (respectively 20 μg and 200 μg per well) and a range of [\n3\nH]-BYX998 concentrations from 0.05 to 300 nM. These solutions were made in buffer containing 50 mM Tris; 100 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.1% Cyclodextrine.\n\n\n \n \nThe specific binding was measured in presence of a constant 7a,25DHC (NVP-BYX998-NX-4) concentration of 10 uM final and the corresponding total binding was measured with buffer instead of NVP-BYX998-NX-4.\n\n\n \nIC50 Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nThe SPA assay was performed in a final volume of 50 μl per well in a 384-well polystyrene Opti plate. The components were added into the wells as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 μl tested compounds in 50 mM Tris; 100 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.1% Cyclodextrine.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nTotal binding was determined by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mM Tris; 100 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.1% Cyclodextrine and non-specific binding was determined by the addition of 10 μl NVP-BYX998-NX-4 (final concentration of 10 μM).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 μL of 10 nM final [3H]-BYX998 in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.1% Cyclodextrine).\n \n20 μL of a mixed bead and membrane suspension in assay buffer, in order to get a final concentration of 20 μg membranes/well and 200 μg beads/well.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe plates were sealed and shaken at room temperature for 10 minutes then allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 12 hours. The plates were counted using a Perkin Elmer TopCount reader, each well being counted for 1 minute.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach IC50 determination was performed with 11 concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA standard data reduction algorithm was used to calculate the percentage of specific binding in the presence of test compound as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n((B−NSB)/(Total−NSB)). 100, where\n\n\n\n \n \nB=Binding in the presence of test compound (in cpm)\n\n\nNSB=Non-specific binding in the presence of excess inhibitor (in cpm)\n\n\nTotal=Binding in the absence of test compound (in cpm)\n\n\nCurve fitting of the normalized concentration response curves using a four parameter logistic fit is then performed using XLfit (v.2 or v.4, IDBS, Guildford, UK). The equation used is XLfit equation no. 205 for a one site sigmoidal dose response curve: Y=A+((B−A)/(1+((C/X)̂D))), where A=min, B=max, C=IC50, D=slope. By default, min is fixed at 0, whereas max is not fixed.\n\n\nKi is calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng, Y. and Prusoff, W. H. (1973). Relationship between the inhibition constant (K1) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 percent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction. Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108):\n\n\n\n \nAequorin Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing the aquorin assay we found out that 7a,25DHC activated EBI2 stably expressed in CHO cells with a EC50 of 18.4 nM compared to the less potent 7b,25DHC for which an EC50 of 398 nM was measured (\nFIG. 15\n).\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \nStable cell line expressing human EBI2 (in pcDNA3.1 vector) and Gα16 was generated with parental CHO cells that stably express apo-aequorin (Euroscreen CHO-A12 cell line). The cells were seeded into 384 well black clear bottom plates (Greiner Bio-one) at 10,000 cells/25 μl well in F12 medium containing 3% FBS and incubated overnight. Coelenterazine (20 μM final) was added into the cell plates at 25 μl/well. The cell plates were returned to incubator for 3 hrs. The compounds were diluted 1:20 into an intermediate plate with Tyrode buffer (130 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). 12.5 μl/well of pre-diluted compounds were transfered into the cell assay plate and read on LumiLux™ (Perkin Elmer) for flash luminescence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn algorithm similar to area under curve (AUC) was created in house to analyze the aequorin kinetic data, which was named Slope Threshold (Slope 100). The algorithm defines the beginning and the end of the luminescence intensity peak by comparing the difference in intensity of each time point with an earlier time point, and determining if the difference exceeds a defined threshold, which was usually set at 100. If it does, then the intensity of the later time point is added into the Slope Threshold's sum.\n\n\n \n \ncAMP Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, in the cAMP assay, the \nstereoisomer\n 7a,25DHC (EC50=10.3 nM) shows to be more potent than the \nstereoisomer\n 7b,25DHC (EC50=10.6 μM) (\nFIG. 16\n).\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \nThe same stable EBI2 cell line used in the aequorin assay was used in cAMP assay. 10,000 cells (25 μA) were seeded per well into white solid 384-well plate and incubated in 37° C. incubator overnight. 500 nl of compound was then transferred into each assay well, followed by 5 μl of forskolin addition for a final concentration of 30 μM. Cells were returned to a 37° C. incubator for 30 min. Finally 15 μl each of HiRange D2-cAMP and anti-cAMP cryptate were dispensed per well. After >1 hr room temperature incubation, data acquisition was done in the time-resolved FRET (fluorescence-resonance energy transfer) mode on Envision™ or ViewLux™ (Perkin Elmer). The ratio between the acceptor fluorescence signal (A665 nm) and donor fluorescence signal (A620 nm)×104, representing the FRET between the conjugated cAMP and the anti-cAMP antibody, was calculated and plotted on Y-axis. The higher the signal, the lower endogenous cAMP concentration is in the sample.\n\n\n \n \nBeta-Arrestin Interaction of EBI2 after Activation with Oxysterols (DiscoveRx)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown for a large number of GPCRs that activation of the receptor leads to phosphorylation of residues at the C-terminus and recruitment of β-arrestin. Subsequently, the GPCR/β-arrestin complex is incoparated into clathrin-coated pits which leads to the internalization of receptor containing vesicles and desensitization of the receptor signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral assay technologies (Transfluor™, (Ghosh, R. N., et al. (2005). Quantitative cell-based high-content screening for vasopressin receptor agonists using transfluor technology. J Biomol Screen 10.; Granas, C., at al. (2005).

Nat Methods 2), Tango™, (Barnea, G., et al. (2008). Here we have applied the Pathhunter™ technology (DiscoverRx) to probe for an interaction of EBI2 with B-arrestin. For that human EBI2 was cloned into the Prolink™ vector (DiscoveRx) for GPCR-prolink fusion protein production. Parental HEK293 cells that stably express β-arrestin2-β-gal-EA fusion protein (HEK293-BAEA) were detached and transiently transfected with hEBI2-prolink vector using Fugene6 transfection reagent in suspension mode. Transfected cells in assay medium (Phenol Red-free DMEM with 10% FBS) were plated into white solid 384 well plates at 15,000 cells/25 μl/well. After overnight incubation, 200 nl of test molecules were transferred into the cell plates by PinTool™ (GNF Systems) followed by 1-2 hour incubation at 37° C., 5% CO2. Flash detection reagents were added at 12.5 μl/well. After 5 min—1 hr room temperature incubation, the cell plates were read on CLIPR™ (Perkin Elmer) or Acquest™ (Molecular Devices) for luminescence signal. The results shows that 7a,25DHC (compound of formula IV) and 7b,25DHC (compound of formula V) activate hEBI2 with EC50 of 8.0 nM and 837 nM (48% efficacy), respectively (\nFIG. 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n5.14 7a,25-OHC is the Oxysterol which was Purified from Tissue Extracts\n\n\n \n \n \n \n7a,25DHC which was synthesized by modification of a known method (method of synthesis 1) (Li, D. & Spencer T. A. (2000) Synthesis of 7a-hydroxy derivatives of regulatory oxysterol, Steroids 65, 529-535) or according to the one-step process (method of synthesis 2) as shown below.\n\n\n \nMethod of \nSynthesis\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom commercially available 5-cholesten-3b,25-diol (Steraloids, C6510-000), the diols are protected with benzoyl chloride, followed by C7 oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate in absolute benzene and molecular sieve under microwave irradiation at 150° C. for 4 h. L-selectride in THF at −78° C. facilitated diastereo-selective reduction (20:1) of C7 carbonyl to 7a-hydroxy group. The two diastereomers can be conveniently isolated using silica gel column chromatography (75% ethyl acetate in hexnanes to 100% ethyl acetate). Deprotection of di-benzoyl ester yielded the \nfinal product\n 7a,25DHC in overall 14% yield (4 steps).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMethod of \nSynthesis\n 2\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom commercially available 5-cholesten-3β,25-diol-7-one (Steraloids, C6510-000), the C7-carbonyl group was diastereoselectively reduced (dr˜20:1) with L-Selectride in THF at −78° C. for 5 h, after work-up and column chromatography, the pure 7a,25DHC can be obtained in one step at around 50% yield. This one step process is very useful for synthesizing radiolabelled (e.g. \n3\nH-labeled) 7a,25DHC.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 3 above, \ncompound\n 7a,25DHC proofed to be more potent than 7b,25DHC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine the exact nature of the oxysterol we purified from sheep liver we developed an analytical method to separate the two different oxysterols stereoisomers (7a,25DHC versus 7b,25DHC) by liquid chromatography.\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine the 7,25DHC stereochemistry of bioactive material from the tissue extracts we first established an analytical method to separate the two \ndiastereomers\n 7a,25DHC and 7b,25DHC using reference compounds. In a second step retention time for the reference compounds were compared to bioactive material from the tissue extracts. The samples used in this experiment were from two sheep liver preparations, S5 and S9, and three biologically active fractions for each preparation were collected in the last step of purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 7a,25DHC and 7b,25DHC were separated by liquid chromatography (LC) on a Thermo-Fischer Hypersil Gold™ column. Water (5 mM NH\n4\nAc) and acetonitrile (0.1% acetic acid) were used a mobile phases. The gradient ranged from 20% to 85% acetonitrile over 12 min (\nFIG. 18A\n). The compounds were selectively detected by electrospray mass spectrometry, in 2 instruments. In both cases, the in-source fragmentation product (loss of 2 H\n2\nO C\n27\nH\n47\nO\n3\n \n+\n->C\n27\nH\n43\nO\n+\n, 383.3308 Da) was monitored, as well as 2 CID (collision induced decay) fragments of that specific ion at 253.27 and 157.18 Da. Only if all 3 ions are simultaneously observed is it concluded that DHC is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst a Thermo Finnigan LTQ™ instrument was used. It is capable of fast data acquisition, allowing full use of the liquid chromatography retention time (RT) peak separation. In all six samples only 7a,25DHC and no 7b,25DHC was detected (\nFIG. 18B\n). We confirmed these results on a second instrument (Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap™) which displays a higher mass resolution and accuracy but a slightly reduced liquid chromatography resolution.\n\n\n \n \n5.15 Isolation of Natural EBI2 μLigand from Pig Liver\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParallely to the broad pharmacological characterization of the oxysterols capable of modulating EBI2, the purification of natural EBI2 ligands from pig liver extracts has been attempted.\n\n\n \nExtraction Protocol\n\n\n \n \n \n10 Kg of pig liver, was grinded in a meat grinder, and were homogenized with (every 500 g of wet grinded tissue with 500 mL water) using vita mix, and extracted with 20 L of 1:1 hexanes and isopropanol mixture for 1 h.

These data further confirm and support the findings shown above in section 5.9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesized 7a,25DHC and 7b,25DHC were compared with the active fractions obtained by fractionation of the pig liver extracts as described above. The synthesized compounds and the active fractions were analysed for retention time in liquid chromatography and MS/MS (\nFIG. 19\n).

At the 7 position the axial alpha position is much preferred over the equatorial beta position (\ncompound\n 7a,25DHC as depicted in Formula IV and \ncompound\n 7b,25DHC as depicted in Formula V). Hydroxylation of the side chain is preferred at the 25 position although also the 27 compound shows good potency.

Binding of [\n3\nH]-7a,25DHC to EBI2 is saturable with high affinity (Kd=25+/−10 nM (n=3) and displaceable with increasing concentration of 7a,25DHC and other oxysterols. Using the other stereoisomer [\n3\nH]-7b,25DHC we were not able to detect specific binding to EBI2 membranes (data not shown).\n\n\n \n5.17 Activation of EBI2 Leads to Phosphorylation in the Map/Erk Pathway\n\n\n \n \n \nMitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that respond to extracellular stimuli and regulate various cellular activities.\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \nCells (E2=CHO/AEQ/Gqi5/hEBI2) were seeded at 2×10\n5 \ncell/well in a 12 well plate (TPP #92012) and incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \novernight. The next day medium was removed and cells were starved in serum-free medium for 4 h. Subsequently compound was added for 5 min at RT before cells were lysed (70 ul, 0.5% Triton-X100, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH7.5, Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail Roche #04693124001). Cell lysates were resolved by gradient SDS-PAGE (NuPage™4-12%, #NP0322Box), transferred by semi-dry blotting to nitrocellulose (Invitrogen, #LC2001) and probed with a phospho p42/44 MAPK (T202/Y204) rabbit mAb (Cell Signalling #4376S). After treatment with a secondary goat anti rabbit-HRP (Pierce #41460) antibody the blots were developed for chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura™, Pierce #34075) and visualized using a BioRad GEL DOC™ imaging system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have tested EBI2 expressing CHO cell line for MAP/ERK phosphorylation and find that 7a,25DHC and other oxysterols according to the invention can potently activate the MAP/ERK signaling pathway by phosphorylating p44/42 MAP kinase (\nFIG. 21\n). As a control we have used the parental CHO cell line which does not express human EBI2. Even high 7a,25-OHC concentrations do not activate a MAP/ERK signal in this control cell line.\n\n\n \n \n5.18 Specificity of the Interaction Between 7a,25DHC and 7a,27DHC with EBI2\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far oxysterols have been noted to have various physiological activities namely regulate the expression of genes that participate in both sterol and fat metabolism, serve as substrates for the synthesis of bile acids, and are intermediates in the transfer of sterols from the periphery to the liver (Russell, D. W. (2000). Oxysterol biosynthetic enzymes. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1529, 126-135). In order to assess potential interactions of the two most potent EBI2 agonists (7a,25-OHC and 7a,27-OHC) we have tested them in a panel of reporter gene assays against the following nuclear hormone receptor: SXR (NR112; ENSG00000144852), ERa (NR3A1; ENSG00000091831), FXRa (NR1H4; ENSG00000012504), GR (NR3C1; ENSG00000113580), LXRa (NR1H3; ENSG00000025434), PPARg (NR1C3; ENSG00000132170), RXRa (NR2B1; ENSG00000078380) We find that these two oxysterols did not activate the above-mentioned nuclear hormone receptors at concentrations up to 10 μM. We have also evaluated the same two compounds in a safety panel routinely used for evaluation of compounds during drug development. This included binding assays for 26 different GPCRs, functional assays of 9 different GPCRs, 40 kinase assays, as well as selected ion channels, proteases, transporter and enzyme assays. In none of these assay did we see a significant interaction between either 7a,25DHC or 7a,27DHC and the tested partner (data not shown)\n\n\n \n \n5.19 \nOxysterol\n 7a,25DHC Act as Chemo-Attractants for Immune Cells.\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \nChemotaxis assays were performed in MultiScreen-MIC™96-well plates with 5-μm pore polycarbonate filters (Millipore #MAMI C5S10) Cell suspensions and chemokine dilutions were made in RPMI1640 with glutamax™ (Invitrogen, #61870-010) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, #11140-035), sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, #11360-039), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, #15140-114), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen #31350-010) and 0.5% BSA (Gibco #15260).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cells (RS11846 or EBV-infected human B-cells) or murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were washed once with medium and resuspended at 1×10\n6\n/ml. 100 μl of this suspension was added into the wells of the filter plate and gently placed into the receiver plate containing 150 μl of a given compound dilution. The final DMSO concentration was less then 0.1%. After migration for 3 hr at 37° C. in an incubator, the filter plate was carefully removed from the receiver plate and discarded. The migrated cells in the receiver plate were resuspended and transferred into round-bottom 96-well plate, centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μl PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.1% NaN\n3 \n(FACS buffer). The input cells (100 μl) were similarly processed. For the calculation of the specific migration, a fixed number of beads (10000; Invitrogen #PCB100)) in 20 μl FACS buffer was added and the suspension was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS instrument PAS™ (Partec). Cells were identified based on their forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) pattern. Chemotaxis is expressed either as total cell number or as percent of input cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA expression arrays from B cells in different stages of their life cycle show a distinct profile of EBI2 expression (\nFIGS. 22\n A and B). While there is clear expression of EBI2 in naïve B cells, B cells from lymph node germinal centers sharply down-regulate EBI2 expression (Gatto, D., at al. (2009) Guidance of B Cells by the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor EBI2 Shapes Humoral Immune Responses. Immunity 31[2], 259-269; Pereira, J. P., et al. (2009) EBI2 mediates B cell segregation between the outer and centre follicle. Nature, 460). Once affinity maturation has been completed and the B cells are transformed into plasma B cells or memory B cells EBI2 expression is again highly expressed (\nFIGS. 20A\n and B). This pattern is the same for human and mouse B cells subsets (Longo, N. S., et al. (2009). Analysis of somatic hypermutation in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome shows specific deficiencies in mutational targeting. Blood 113, 3706-3715; Luckey, C. J., et al. (2006). Memory T and memory B cells share a transcriptional program of self-renewal with long-term hematopoietic stem cells. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103, 3304-3309).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEBI2 has been originally identified by its up-regulation in B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (Birkenbach 1993). Conducting a FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) experiment using an anti-EBI2 monoclonal antibody (Eurocreen) we find that this EBV-infected human B cell line expresses high levels of EBI2 on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethodology for generation of EBV-transformed peripheral B lymphocytes. Human peripheral B lymphocytes (PBL) were prepared from peripheral blood as a cell suspension by centrifugation on Ficoll plaque. PBL were rinsed in PBS and resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium (10% FCS and antibiotics) at the concentration of 2×10\n7\n/cell/ml. Cells were divided in aliquots of 500 μl and seeded in 24 well plates. To each well (10\n7 \nPBL), 500 μl of the B95-8 cell line supernatants (containing Epstein Barr virus) were added. The B95-8 cell line is a cell line used to produce EBV (American Type Culture Collection, Cat. CRL-1612). 0.8 μg/ml cyclosporin A (CsA) is added to each well. The cells are fed once a week by exchanging about half of the medium with fresh one containing 0.8 μg/ml CsA. This treatment is repeated for over 3 weeks until clusters of growing cells are visible. Single clusters are transferred to small culture flasks and the transformed cells are further expanded. Most transformed cells are from a B cell lineage. Aliquots of cells are frozen as soon as the cells are growing well. Frozen aliquots (1 ml, around 10\n7\ncells) are thawed and diluted in \nRPMI\n 1640, 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin and passaged by diluting ¼ to ⅛.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe find that 7a,25DHC can potently attract these EBV-infected B cells in a trans well assay system. As a control, the concentration of 7a,25DHC was identical in both compartments (\nFIG. 23\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second set of experiments we tested a Burkitt's lymphoma pre B cell line called RS11846 (provided by Dr. John C. Reed, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, USA; Gauwerky, C. E., et al. (1988). Pre-B-cell leukemia with at (8; 14) and at (14; 18) translocation is preceded by follicular lymphoma. \nOncogene\n 2, 431-435.; Reed, J. C. et al. (1993). Somatic point mutations in the translocated bcl-2 genes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and lymphocytic leukemias: implications for mechanisms of tumor progression. Leuk. \nLymphoma\n 10, 157-163.). Inspection of DNA array data (BioGPS) indicated that this cell line has high expression levels of endogenous EBI2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe find that 7a,25DHC can potently attract RS11846 cells and that this attraction can be blocked by pertussis toxin, a reagent which blocks signalling of Gαi-coupled receptors by ADP-ribosylation of the Gαi subunit. Similarly to classical chemokines, we find a bell-shaped activity curve which indicates reduced attraction at high compound concentrations (\nFIGS. 24\n A and B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also conducted cell migration experiments of RS11846 cells with a set of different oxysterols. The results (\nFIG. 25\n) show a clear correlation between the potency of different oxysterols in attracting RS11846 cells and the potency of these compounds in cell-based assays for functional activation of EBI2 (FLIPR, GTPgS) or EBI2 radioligand binding assays (see Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOxysterol-mediated chemoattraction is not limited to B-cells but can also be observed with other immune cells expressing EBI2. Messenger RNA expression analysis of different human immune cells indicated that myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are highly expressing EBI2 (\nFIG. 26\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to generate sufficient numbers of dendritic cells (DC) we isolated bone marrow from wild type and EBI2-deficient mice (Deltagen) and treated them in culture for 7-8 days with murine IL4 and murine GM-CSF. Using this protocol a homogenous population of dendritic cells can be generated. We find that while DCs from wild type animals migrate towards 7a,25DHC, DCs from EBI2(−/−) mice do not migrate towards 7a,25DHC. This result demonstrates that chemoattractant properties of 7a,25DHC are mediated by EBI2 (\nFIG. 27\n).\n\n\n \nImmune Challenge of EBI2 Knockout Mice (−/−)\n\n\n \n \n \nIdentification of the chemoattractant properties of oxysterols on immune cells suggested that ablation of EBI2 will have an impact on the proper trafficking of EBI2 expressing cells under various physiological conditions. Thus, we challenged wild-type and EBI2(−/−) mice with nitro-phenyl chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG) and alum.\n\n\n \n \nImmunisation of EBI2(−/−), and Wild Type Mice with Nitrophenyl-Chicken Gamma Globulin (NP-CGG)\n\n\n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter pre-bleeding NP-CGG, immunization of EBI-2 ko mice or littermates was performed by injecting i.p. 200 μl of 50 μg NP(15)-CGG (Biosearch Technologies, Inc.; # N-5055) in Alum (Serva; #12261). Seven days thereafter serum was taken and NP-specific IgG1 and IgM analysed in ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA measurement of nitorphenhyl-specific immunoglobulins IgG1 and IgM anti-NP ELISA was performed by coating 96-well plates (Costar; #9018) with 10 μg ml\n−1 \nNP(23)BSA (Biosearch Technologies, Inc.; #N-5050) in PBS (Gibco; #14040-091) over night at RT, and blocked with PBS/1% BSA/0.05\n% Tween\n 20 for 1 h at RT. Serum samples were serially diluted (1:3) starting at 1:50 in PBS/1% BSA/0.05% Tween 20 (=reagent buffer) in duplicates and incubated for 2 h at * 25° C., and NP-binding IgG1 and IgM was detected using biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 (Zymed; #04-6140) or biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotech; #1020-08), followed by Europium-conjugated streptavidin (Wallac; #1244-360). After each incubation step plates were washed 6 times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20). For measuring Europium-related light emission Enhancement Solution™ (Wallac; #1244-105) was added and plates measured in a \nVictor\n 2 Device™ (Wallac; 1420 Multilabel Counter) using the default Europium program. The NP-specific IgG1 and IgM titers were calculated by determining the titers at 50% max., groups averaged, and displayed as mean of titers 50% max. +/−STD, and Median. Seven days after immune challenge we measured immunoglobulin levels. While there are no alteration in the IgM expression level (\nFIG. 28A\n), we find a blunted IgG1 response in that the EBI2(−/−) mice only produce about half of the titer compared to wild type animals (\nFIG. 28B\n).\n\n\n \n5.20 Results\n\n\n \n \n \nOur findings provide an unanticipated link between recent results which have identified a crucial role for EBI2 in promoting B-cell localization within lymphoid organs (Pereira, J. P., et al. (2009) EBI2 mediates B-cell segregation between the outer and centre follicle.
