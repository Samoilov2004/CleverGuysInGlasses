Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of European Patent Application No. 09165780.9, filed Jul. 17, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:\n\n\n \n \nmGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to group I,\n\n\nmGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II, and\n\n\nmGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, L-dopa induced dyskinesia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain and drug dependency (\nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2002), 12, (12)). Furthermore, \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2008), 18(2) describes the treatment of mGluR5 antagonists in situations where mGluR5 activity is exacerbated due to a specific genetic background such as Fragile-X syndrome. Fragile X patients suffer from cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, aggression, seizure, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, excessive tactile sensitivity, loose bowel and sensory hyper-excitability. Described in this document is also the benefit in the treatment of addiction (drugs, opioids, nicotine and alcohol), gastro-esophageal acid reflux disease (GERD), cancer and overactive bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMGluR5 antagonists play also a role in situations where elevated glutamate tonus is present, for example in autism (\nProgress in Neuro\n-\nPsychopharmacology \n& \nBiological Psychiatry, \n32, 2008, 911 and WO2008/066750).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective mGluR5 antagonists are especially useful for the treatment of fragile-X, depression, Parkinson and L-dopa induced dyskinesia.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides imidazoles of formula I\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nR\n1 \nis halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis lower alkyl, lower hydroxyalkyl or lower alkoxyalkyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower hydroxyalkyl or lower alkoxyalkyl;\n\n\nQ is either —N═ or —CH═;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis a group of formula IIa or IIb\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nX, Y and Z are each independently —CH═ or —N═, and whereby only one of X or Y is a nitrogen atom;\n\n\nR\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare each independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower hydroxyalkyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, —(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—(CO)O-lower alkyl, —(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—S(O)\n2\n-lower alkyl, —(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—C(O)—NR′R″ and\n\n \n \n \n \n \nwhere m=0-3 and R′ and R″ are each independently hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n\n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by having valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides compounds of formula I, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the above-mentioned compounds as pharmaceutically active substances and their production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a process for preparing a compound according to formula I following

\n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, L-dopa induced dyskinesia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, pain, drug dependency, fragile-X syndrome, autism, addiction (drugs, opioids, nicotine and alcohol), gastro-esophageal acid reflux disease (GERD), cancer and overactive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially useful in the treatment of fragile-X, depression, Parkinson and L-dopa induced dyskinesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu5a receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by E.-J. Schlaeger and K. Christensen (\nCytotechnology \n1998, 15, 1-13). For functional assays, [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed largely as described previously (Porter et al., Br J. Pharmacol 1999, 128, 13-20) on stably expressed recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (purchased from Molecular Probes, 2 μM final concentration) [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, Calif., USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 minute preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC\n50\n, and Hill coefficient using the iterative non linear curve fitting software Xcel fit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n=IC\n \n50\n/1+\nL/\n \nKd \n \n\n\n \n \nin which the IC\n50 \nvalues are those concentrations of the compounds tested in which causes 50% inhibition of the competing radioligand ([\n3\nH]MPEP). [L] is the concentration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the K\nd \nvalue of the radioligand is empiracally determined for each batch of membranes prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are mGluR5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of K\ni\n<1000 nM.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n \n\n\nExample \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNo./Formula\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nNo./Formula\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 1/IB\n\n\n40\n\n\n29/IB\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 2/IB\n\n\n69\n\n\n30/IB\n\n\n211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 3/IB\n\n\n39\n\n\n31/IB\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 4/IB\n\n\n345\n\n\n32/IB\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 5/IB\n\n\n44\n\n\n33/IB\n\n\n446\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 6/IA\n\n\n146\n\n\n34/IB\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 7/IA\n\n\n180\n\n\n35/IA\n\n\n347\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 8/IB\n\n\n113\n\n\n36/IA\n\n\n173\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 9/IB\n\n\n42\n\n\n37/IA\n\n\n238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10/IB\n\n\n75\n\n\n39/IA\n\n\n285\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11/IB\n\n\n265\n\n\n41/IB\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12/IB\n\n\n40\n\n\n42/IB\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13/IB\n\n\n94\n\n\n43/IA\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14/ID\n\n\n42\n\n\n44/IB\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15/ID\n\n\n154\n\n\n45/IB\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16/ID\n\n\n659\n\n\n46/IA\n\n\n569\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17/IC\n\n\n144\n\n\n48/IB\n\n\n788\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18/IC\n\n\n559\n\n\n50/IB\n\n\n559\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19/IC\n\n\n504\n\n\n51/IB\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20/IC\n\n\n817\n\n\n52/IB\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21/IB\n\n\n40\n\n\n53/IA\n\n\n204\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22/IA\n\n\n384\n\n\n54/IB\n\n\n131\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23/IB\n\n\n52\n\n\n55/IB\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24/IA\n\n\n277\n\n\n56/IA\n\n\n597\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25/IB\n\n\n148\n\n\n57/IA\n\n\n808\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n26/IB\n\n\n33\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27/IB\n\n\n40\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28/IB\n\n\n222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention, for example, compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical compositions also can be in the form of suppositories or injectable solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the pharmaceutical compositions can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage at which compounds of the invention can be administered can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, in particular between 7 and 700 mg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention:\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n4-[4-(3-chloro-phenylethynyl)-2-methyl-imidazol-1-yl]-1H-pyridin-2-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) 2-chloro-4-[4-(3-chloro-phenylethynyl)-2-methyl-imidazol-1-yl]-pyridine (120 mg, 0.366 mmol) was dissolved in 6 ml tert-butanol.
