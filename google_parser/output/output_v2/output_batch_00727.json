Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to lipid formulated double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) targeting a Serum Amyloid A (SAA) gene, and methods of using the dsRNA to inhibit expression of SAA.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSerum Amyloid A (SAA) is an 104 amino acid HDL-associated apolipoprotein whose level in the blood is elevated up to 1000-fold in response to various injuries including trauma, inflammation and neoplasia. SAA proteins are involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport, inhibition of lymphocyte and endothelial cell proliferation, induction of matrix metalloproteinases, and modulation of the inflammatory response via both anti- and pro-inflammatory activities. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, trigger inflammation and stimulate the production of acute-phase proteins, including SAA1 and SAA2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver is the major site of SAA expression, and extrahepatic SAA expression has also been described in human atherosclerotic lesions, in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients, and in synovial tissues from rheumatoid arthritis patients. SAA levels have also been found to be elevated in the serum of patients with a wide range of malignancies, being highest in those with metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary sites. SAA mRNA and protein has also been found to be locally expressed in human colon carcinoma tissues and in epithelial carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour SAA loci, all mapped to chromosome 11p, have been described. Two of the loci (SAA1 and SAA2) encode acute-phase SAAs (A-SAAs), which exhibit a dramatic transient increase in serum concentration in response to inflammatory stimuli; a third locus (SAA3) defines a pseudogene; and a fourth locus (SAA4) encodes a constitutively expressed SAA (C-SAA), which responds only moderately to inflammatory stimuli. SAA3 is expressed in mice and other mammalian species, but is not expressed in humans. SAA1 and SAA2 are 95% homologous in both their coding and noncoding regions, and are coordinately induced in response to inflammation. The A-SAAs are the circulating precursors of the insoluble cleavage product amyloid A that is deposited in major organs in secondary amyloidosis (also called AA amyloidosis, or reactive amyloidosis), a progressive and fatal disease that is an occasional consequence of chronic or episodic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and leprosy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDouble-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) have been shown to block gene expression in a highly conserved regulatory mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). WO 99/32619 (Fire et al.) disclosed the use of a dsRNA of at least 25 nucleotides in length to inhibit the expression of genes in \nC. elegans\n. dsRNA has also been shown to degrade target RNA in other organisms, including plants (see, e.g., WO 99/53050, Waterhouse et al.; and WO 99/61631, Heifetz et al.), \nDrosophila \n(see, e.g., Yang, D., et al., \nCurr. Biol\n. (2000) 10:1191-1200), and mammals (see WO 00/44895, Limmer; and DE 101 00 586.5, Kreutzer et al.).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides compositions containing double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) and methods for inhibiting the expression of an SAA gene, such as one or both of SAA1 and SAA2, such as in a cell or mammal.

In some embodiments, the dsRNAs featured in the invention target both an SAA1 gene and an SAA2 gene. The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases, such as an amyloidosis, in a mammal caused by the expression of an SAA gene. dsRNA directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNAs of the compositions featured herein include an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of an SAA gene. The use of these dsRNAs enables the targeted degradation of mRNAs of genes that are implicated in pathologies associated with an inflammatory response (e.g., an acute phase inflammatory response) in mammals. Very low dosages of SAA dsRNAs in particular can specifically and efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of an SAA gene. Using cell-based assays, the present inventors have demonstrated that dsRNAs targeting SAA can specifically and efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of an SAA gene. Thus, methods and compositions including these dsRNAs are useful for treating pathological processes that can be mediated by down regulating SAA, such as in the treatment of amyloidosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNAs of the compositions can include a sense strand including at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 or more nucleotides of a sense strand sequence selected from Table 2. The dsRNAs of the compositions can include an antisense strand including at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 or more nucleotides of a sense strand sequence selected from Table 2. In an embodiment, the sense strand can include 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 or more contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:37, SEQ ID NO:127, SEQ ID NO:95, SEQ ID NO:105, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:23, or SEQ ID NO:155. In an embodiment, the antisense strand can include 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 or more contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:38, SEQ ID NO:128, SEQ ID NO:96, SEQ ID NO:106, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:24, or SEQ ID NO:156.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNAs of the compositions can target 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 or more contiguous nucleotides of a SAA mRNA, SEQ ID NO:286, SEQ ID NO:220, SEQ ID NO:230, SEQ ID NO:324, SEQ ID NO:223, SEQ ID NO:386, and/or SEQ ID NO:373.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA can be conjugated to a ligand. The dsRNA can be formulated in a lipid formulation. In an embodiment, the dsRNA is formulated in a LNP formulation, a LNP01 formulation, a Lipid A-SNALP formulation, or a SNALP formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNAs of the compositions, when administered to a cell, can result in about 50-100%, 97%, 95%, 92%, 89%, or 74% inhibition of SAA mRNA expression as measured by a real time PCR assay. The dsRNAs of the compositions, when administered to a cell, can result in about 50-100%, 89%, 87%, 83%, 68%, or 54% inhibition of SAA mRNA expression as measured by a branched DNA assay. The dsRNAs of the compositions, when administered to a cell, can result in about 50-100%, 100%, 99%, or 93% inhibition of SAA protein expression as measured by an ELISA assay. The dsRNAs of the compositions have an IC50 of less than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 pM. The dsRNAs of the compositions can reduce SAA protein expression by about 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% in mice compared to an siRNA control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and compositions containing an SAA dsRNA are useful for treating pathological processes mediated by SAA expression, such as inflammation-associated disorders, such as amyloidosis. Other pathological processes can include psoriatic arthritis, chronic juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, adult Still's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary periodic fevers, tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, leprosy, pyelonephritis, decubitus ulcers, Whipple's disease, acne conglobata, common variable immunodeficiency hypo/agammaglobulinemia, cystic fibrosis, hepatoma, renal carcinoma, Castleman's disease, Hodgkin's disease, adult hairy cell leukemia, Waldenström's disease, a neoplasm, a chronic infections, a chronic inflammatory disease, chronic arthritis, chronic sepsis, a periodic fever syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, or Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following detailed description discloses how to make and use the compositions containing dsRNAs to inhibit the expression of an SAA gene, as well as compositions and methods for treating diseases and disorders caused by the expression of these genes. The pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include a dsRNA having an antisense strand comprising a region of complementarity which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of an SAA gene, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions featured in the invention also include a dsRNA having an antisense strand having a region of complementarity which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of an SAA gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in some aspects, pharmaceutical compositions containing an SAA dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, methods of using the compositions to inhibit expression of an SAA gene, and methods of using the pharmaceutical compositions to treat diseases caused by expression of an SAA gene are featured in the invention.\n\n\n \nI. DEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“G,” “C,” “A” and “U” each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil as a base, respectively. “T” and “dT” are used interchangeably herein and refer to a deoxyribonucleotide wherein the nucleobase is thymine, e.g., deoxyribothymine. However, it will be understood that the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” or “deoxyribonucleotide” can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. Sequences comprising such replacement moieties are embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “Serum Amyloid A” (“SAA”) refers to an SAA1 or an SAA2 gene (e.g., an endogenous SAA1 or SAA2 gene) in a cell. SAA1 is also known as serum amyloid A1, MGC111216, PIG4, SAA, and tumor protein p53 inducible protein 4 (TP5314). The sequence of two alternative human SAA1 mRNA transcripts can be found at NM\n—\n000331.3 and NM\n—\n199161.2. The sequence of mouse SAA1 mRNA can be found at NM\n—\n009117.3. A single, near full length, SAA-like trace cDNA sequence from cynomolgus monkey is Mfa#527795076 (\nMacaca fascicularis\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSAA2 is also known as serum amyloid A2 and SAA. The sequence of two alternative human SAA2 mRNA transcripts can be found at NM\n—\n001127380.1 and NM\n—\n030754.3. The sequence of mouse SAA2 mRNA is at NM\n—\n011314.1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “target sequence” refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of an SAA gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product. The target sequence is complementary to the dsRNA antisense sequence and thus has the same sequence as the dsRNA sense sequence, minus any overhang that is present in the sense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “strand comprising a sequence” refers to an oligonucleotide comprising a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary,” when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Such conditions can, for example, be stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50° C. or 70° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing. Other conditions, such as physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis includes base-pairing of the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence over the entire length of the first and second nucleotide sequence. Such sequences can be referred to as “fully complementary” with respect to each other herein. However, where a first sequence is referred to as “substantially complementary” with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA comprising one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide comprises a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as “fully complementary” for the purposes described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complementary” sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled. Such non-Watson-Crick base pairs includes, but not limited to, G:U Wobble or Hoogstein base pairing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “complementary,” “fully complementary” and “substantially complementary” herein may be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a polynucleotide that is “substantially complementary to at least part of” a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide that is substantially complementary to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., an mRNA encoding SAA, such as SAA1 or SAA2) including a 5′ UTR, an open reading frame (ORF), or a 3′ UTR. For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of an SAA mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding SAA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “double-stranded RNA” or “dsRNA,” as used herein, refers to a complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure comprising two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined above, nucleic acid strands. In general, the majority of nucleotides of each strand are ribonucleotides, but as described in detail herein, each or both strands can also include at least one non-ribonucleotide, e.g., a deoxyribonucleotide and/or a modified nucleotide. In addition, as used in this specification, “dsRNA” may include chemical modifications to ribonucleotides, including substantial modifications at multiple nucleotides and including all types of modifications disclosed herein or known in the art. Any such modifications, as used in an siRNA type molecule, are encompassed by “dsRNA” for the purposes of this specification and claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a “hairpin loop.” Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a “linker.” The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA minus any overhangs that are present in the duplex. In addition to the duplex structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs. The term “siRNA” is also used herein to refer to a dsRNA as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “nucleotide overhang” refers to the unpaired nucleotide or nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3′-end of one strand of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5′-end of the other strand, or vice versa. “Blunt” or “blunt end” means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A “blunt ended” dsRNA is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule. In an embodiment, the sequences shown in the “Sequence without chemistry (5′-3′)” column of Table 2 (SAA siRNAs; below) can include one or more overhangs comprised of one or more nucleotides. In one aspect, the overhang is a two \nnucleotide\n 3′ overhang comprising the sequence NN, where NN can be any nucleotide, e.g., C, A, G, T. In an embodiment, the overhang can include one or more phosphorothioates on the overhang, e.g., the \nterminal\n 3′ dT of the overhang can have a phosphorothioate. In an embodiment, the overhang is dTsdT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antisense strand” refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term “region of complementarity” refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches are most tolerated in the terminal regions and, if present, are generally in a terminal region or regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5′ and/or 3′ terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sense strand,” as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Introducing into a cell,” when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also be “introduced into a cell,” wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such instance, introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “silence,” “inhibit the expression of,” “down-regulate the expression of,” “suppress the expression of” and the like in as far as they refer to an SAA gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of an SAA gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of mRNA which may be isolated and/or detected from a first cell or group of cells in which an SAA gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the expression of an SAA gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to SAA gene transcription, e.g., the amount of protein encoded by an SAA gene which is secreted by a cell, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g., apoptosis. In principle, SAA gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing the target, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given dsRNA inhibits the expression of an SAA gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant invention, the assays provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in certain instances, expression of an SAA gene is suppressed by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. In some embodiments, an SAA gene is suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. In some embodiments, an SAA gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. Tables 3, 4, and 5, and \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n indicate a range of inhibition of expression obtained in in vitro and ex vivo assays using various SAA dsRNA molecules at various concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein in the context of SAA expression, the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of pathological processes mediated by SAA expression. In the context of the present invention insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions recited herein below (other than pathological processes mediated by SAA expression), the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression of such condition, such as the slowing and progression of amyloidosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrases “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount” refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of pathological processes mediated by SAA expression or an overt symptom of pathological processes mediated by SAA expression. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily determined by an ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, for example, the type of pathological processes mediated by SAA expression, the patient's history and age, the stage of pathological processes mediated by SAA expression, and the administration of other anti-pathological processes mediated by SAA expression agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” comprises a pharmacologically effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmacologically effective amount,” “therapeutically effective amount” or simply “effective amount” refers to that amount of a RNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a dsRNA targeting SAA can reduce SAA serum levels by at least 25%. In another example, a therapeutically effective amount of a dsRNA targeting SAA can improve renal function by at least 25%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “transformed cell” is a cell into which a vector has been introduced from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.\n\n\n \nII. DOUBLE-STRANDED RIBONUCLEIC ACID (dsRNA)\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described in more detail herein, the invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of an SAA gene in a cell or mammal, e.g., in a human having an amyloidosis, where the dsRNA includes an antisense strand having a region of complementarity which is complementary to at least a part of an mRNA formed in the expression of an SAA gene, and where the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and where said dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing said SAA gene, inhibits the expression of said SAA gene by at least 30% as assayed by, for example, a PCR or branched DNA (bDNA)-based method, or by a protein-based method, such as by Western blot. Expression of an SAA gene can be reduced by at least 30% when measured by an assay as described in the Examples below. For example, expression of an SAA gene in cell culture, such as in HepB3 cells, can be assayed by measuring SAA mRNA levels, such as by bDNA or TaqMan assay, or by measuring protein levels, such as by ELISA assay. The dsRNA of the invention can further include one or more single-stranded nucleotide overhangs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc. The dsRNA includes two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to form a duplex structure. One strand of the dsRNA (the antisense strand) includes a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and generally fully complementary, to a target sequence, derived from the sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of an SAA gene, the other strand (the sense strand) includes a region that is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. Optionally, the region of the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence of an SAA mRNA is substantially complementary to both an SAA1 and an SAA2 mRNA. Generally, the duplex structure is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 19 and 21 base pairs in length. Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and 30, or between 25 and 30, or between 18 and 25, or between 19 and 24, or between 19 and 21, or 19, 20, or 21 base pairs in length. In one embodiment the duplex is 19 base pairs in length. In another embodiment the duplex is 21 base pairs in length. When two different siRNAs are used in combination, the duplex lengths can be identical or can differ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach strand of the dsRNA of invention is generally between 15 and 30, or between 18 and 25, or 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides in length. In other embodiments, each is strand is 25-30 nucleotides in length. Each strand of the duplex can be the same length or of different lengths. When two different siRNAs are used in combination, the lengths of each strand of each siRNA can be identical or can differ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA of the invention can include one or more single-stranded overhang(s) of one or more nucleotides. In one embodiment, at least one end of the dsRNA has a single-stranded nucleotide overhang of 1 to 4, generally 1 or 2 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the antisense strand of the dsRNA has 1-10 nucleotides overhangs each at the 3′ end and the 5′ end over the sense strand. In further embodiments, the sense strand of the dsRNA has 1-10 nucleotides overhangs each at the 3′ end and the 5′ end over the antisense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n‘Generally, the dsRNA includes two 3’ overhangs. In an embodiment, the antisense strand of the dsRNA has a nucleotide overhang at the 3′-end, and the 5′-end is blunt. In another embodiment, the sense strand of the dsRNA has a nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and the 5′ end is blunt. In another embodiment, both ends of the dsRNA can be blunt. In another embodiment, one or more of the nucleotides in the overhang is replaced with a nucleoside thiophosphate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an SAA gene is a human SAA gene. In specific embodiments, the sense strand of the dsRNA is one of the sense sequences from Table 2, and the antisense strand is one of the antisense sequences of Table 2. Alternative antisense agents that target elsewhere in the target sequence provided in Table 2 can readily be determined using the target sequence and the flanking SAA sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs having a duplex structure of between 20 and 23, but specifically 21, base pairs have been hailed as particularly effective in inducing RNA interference (Elbashir et al., EMBO 2001, 20:6877-6888). However, others have found that shorter or longer dsRNAs can be effective as well. In the embodiments described above, by virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in Table 2, the dsRNAs featured in the invention can include at least one strand of a length described therein. It can be reasonably expected that shorter dsRNAs having one of the sequences of Table 2 minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends may be similarly effective as compared to the dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs having a partial sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, or 22 or more contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences of Table 2, and differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of an SAA gene in an assay as described herein below by not more than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% inhibition from a dsRNA comprising the full sequence, are contemplated by the invention. Further, dsRNAs that cleave within a desired SAA target sequence can readily be made using the corresponding SAA antisense sequence and a complementary sense sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the dsRNAs provided in Table 2 identify a site in an SAA mRNA (e.g., in an SAA1 and/or an SAA2 mRNA) that is susceptible to RNAi based cleavage. As such, the present invention further features dsRNAs that target within the sequence targeted by one of the agents of the present invention. As used herein, a second dsRNA is said to target within the sequence of a first dsRNA if the second dsRNA cleaves the message anywhere within the mRNA that is complementary to the antisense strand of the first dsRNA. Such a second dsRNA will generally consist of at least 15 contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences provided in Table 2 coupled to additional nucleotide sequences taken from the region contiguous to the selected sequence in an SAA1 or SAA2 gene. For example, the last 15 nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1 combined with the next six nucleotides from the target SAA gene produces a single strand agent of 21 nucleotides that is based on one of the sequences provided in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA featured in the invention can contain one or more mismatches to the target sequence. In one embodiment, the dsRNA featured the invention contains no more than 3 mismatches. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it is preferable that the area of mismatch not be located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, it is preferable that the mismatch be restricted to 5 nucleotides from either end, for example 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nucleotide from either the 5′ or 3′ end of the region of complementarity. For example, for a 23 nucleotide dsRNA strand which is complementary to a region of an SAA gene, the dsRNA generally does not contain any mismatch within the central 13 nucleotides. The methods described within the invention can be used to determine whether a dsRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression of an SAA gene. Consideration of the efficacy of dsRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting expression of an SAA gene is important, especially if the particular region of complementarity in an SAA gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within the population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the dsRNA is chemically modified to enhance stability. The nucleic acids featured in the invention may be synthesized and/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in “Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry,” Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Specific examples of dsRNA compounds useful in this invention include dsRNAs containing modified backbones or no natural internucleoside linkages. As defined in this specification, dsRNAs having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified dsRNAs that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified dsRNA backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3′-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3′-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having normal 3′-5′ linkages, 2′-5′ linked analogs of these, and those) having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3′-5′ to 5′-3′ or 2′-5′ to 5′-2′.

Med. Chem. Let., 1994, 4:1053-1060), a thioether, e.g., beryl-5-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660:306-309; Manoharan et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765-2770), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl.

Nos. 4,828,979; 4,948,882; 5,218,105; 5,525,465; 5,541,313; 5,545,730; 5,552,538; 5,578,717, 5,580,731; 5,591,584; 5,109,124; 5,118,802; 5,138,045; 5,414,077; 5,486,603; 5,512,439; 5,578,718; 5,608,046; 4,587,044; 4,605,735; 4,667,025; 4,762,779; 4,789,737; 4,824,941; 4,835,263; 4,876,335; 4,904,582; 4,958,013; 5,082,830; 5,112,963; 5,214,136; 5,082,830; 5,112,963; 5,214,136; 5,245,022; 5,254,469; 5,258,506; 5,262,536; 5,272,250; 5,292,873; 5,317,098; 5,371,241, 5,391,723; 5,416,203, 5,451,463; 5,510,475; 5,512,667; 5,514,785; 5,565,552; 5,567,810; 5,574,142; 5,585,481; 5,587,371; 5,595,726; 5,597,696; 5,599,923; 5,599,928 and 5,688,941, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within a dsRNA. The present invention also includes dsRNA compounds which are chimeric compounds. “Chimeric” dsRNA compounds or “chimeras,” in the context of this invention, are dsRNA compounds, particularly dsRNAs, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of a dsRNA compound. These dsRNAs typically contain at least one region wherein the dsRNA is modified so as to confer upon the dsRNA increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the dsRNA may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, Rnase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of Rnase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of dsRNA inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter dsRNAs when chimeric dsRNAs are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxydsRNAs hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the dsRNA may be modified by a non-ligand group. A number of non-ligand molecules have been conjugated to dsRNAs in order to enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the dsRNA, and procedures for performing such conjugations are available in the scientific literature. Such non-ligand moieties have included lipid moieties, such as cholesterol (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86:6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1994, 4:1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-5-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660:306; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20:533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10:111; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259:327; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75:49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or \ntriethylammonium\n 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18:3777), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14:969), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264:229), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277:923). Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such dsRNA conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of dsRNAs bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the dsRNA still bound to the solid support or following cleavage of the dsRNA in solution phase. Purification of the dsRNA conjugate by HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVector Encoded dsRNAs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, SAA dsRNA molecules are expressed from transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors (see, e.g., Couture, A, et al., \nTIG\n. (1996), 12:5-10; Skillern, A., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22113, Conrad, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22114, and Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,299). These transgenes can be introduced as a linear construct, a circular plasmid, or a viral vector, which can be incorporated and inherited as a transgene integrated into the host genome. The transgene can also be constructed to permit it to be inherited as an extrachromosomal plasmid (Gassmann, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1995) 92:1292).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual strands of a dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters on two separate expression vectors and co-transfected into a target cell. Alternatively each individual strand of the dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters both of which are located on the same expression plasmid. In one embodiment, a dsRNA is expressed as an inverted repeat joined by a linker polynucleotide sequence such that the dsRNA has a stem and loop structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant dsRNA expression vectors are generally DNA plasmids or viral vectors. dsRNA expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on, but not limited to, adeno-associated virus (for a review, see Muzyczka, et al., \nCurr. Topics Micro. Immunol\n. (1992) 158:97-129)); adenovirus (see, for example, Berkner, et al., BioTechniques (1998) 6:616), Rosenfeld et al. (1991, Science 252:431-434), and Rosenfeld et al. (1992), \nCell \n68:143-155)); or alphavirus as well as others known in the art. Retroviruses have been used to introduce a variety of genes into many different cell types, including epithelial cells, in vitro and/or in vivo (see, e.g., Eglitis, et al., \nScience \n(1985) 230:1395-1398; Danos and Mulligan, \nProc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1998) 85:6460-6464; Wilson et al., 1988, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 85:3014-3018; Armentano et al., 1990, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 87:61416145; Huber et al., 1991, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8039-8043; Ferry et al., 1991, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8377-8381; Chowdhury et al., 1991, Science 254:1802-1805; van Beusechem. Et al., 1992, Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7640-19; Kay et al., 1992, Human Gene Therapy 3:641-647; Dai et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10892-10895; Hwu et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 150:4104-4115; U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,116; U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286; PCT Application WO 89/07136; PCT Application WO 89/02468; PCT Application WO 89/05345; and PCT Application WO 92/07573). Recombinant retroviral vectors capable of transducing and expressing genes inserted into the genome of a cell can be produced by transfecting the recombinant retroviral genome into suitable packaging cell lines such as PA317 and Psi-CRIP (Comette et al., 1991, Human Gene Therapy 2:5-10; Cone et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6349). Recombinant adenoviral vectors can be used to infect a wide variety of cells and tissues in susceptible hosts (e.g., rat, hamster, dog, and chimpanzee) (Hsu et al., 1992, J. Infectious Disease, 166:769), and also have the advantage of not requiring mitotically active cells for infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny viral vector capable of accepting the coding sequences for the dsRNA molecule(s) to be expressed can be used, for example vectors derived from adenovirus (AV); adeno-associated virus (AAV); retroviruses (e.g., lentiviruses (LV), Rhabdoviruses, murine leukemia virus); herpes virus, and the like. The tropism of viral vectors can be modified by pseudotyping the vectors with envelope proteins or other surface antigens from other viruses, or by substituting different viral capsid proteins, as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, lentiviral vectors featured in the invention can be pseudotyped with surface proteins from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Ebola, Mokola, and the like. AAV vectors featured in the invention can be made to target different cells by engineering the vectors to express different capsid protein serotypes. For example, an AAV vector expressing a \nserotype\n 2 capsid on a \nserotype\n 2 genome is called \nAAV\n 2/2. This \nserotype\n 2 capsid gene in the \nAAV\n 2/2 vector can be replaced by a \nserotype\n 5 capsid gene to produce an \nAAV\n 2/5 vector. Techniques for constructing AAV vectors which express different capsid protein serotypes are within the skill in the art; see, e.g., Rabinowitz J E et al. (2002), J Virol 76:791-801, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection of recombinant viral vectors suitable for use in the invention, methods for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the dsRNA into the vector, and methods of delivering the viral vector to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art. See, for example, Dornburg R (1995), Gene Therap. 2: 301-310; Eglitis M A (1988), Biotechniques 6: 608-614; Miller A D (1990), Hum Gene Therap. 1: 5-14; Anderson W F (1998), Nature 392: 25-30; and Rubinson D A et al., Nat. Genet. 33: 401-406, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViral vectors can be derived from AV and AAV. In one embodiment, the dsRNA featured in the invention is expressed as two separate, complementary single-stranded RNA molecules from a recombinant AAV vector having, for example, either the U6 or H1 RNA promoters, or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable AV vector for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, a method for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and a method for delivering the vector into target cells, are described in Xia H et al. (2002), \nNat. Biotech. \n20: 1006-1010.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable AAV vectors for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, methods for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and methods for delivering the vectors into target cells are described in Samulski R et al. (1987), J. Virol. 61: 3096-3101; Fisher K J et al. (1996), J. Virol, 70: 520-532; Samulski R et al. (1989), J. Virol. 63: 3822-3826; U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479; U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,941; International Patent Application No. WO 94/13788; and International Patent Application No. WO 93/24641, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe promoter driving dsRNA expression in either a DNA plasmid or viral vector featured in the invention may be a eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (e.g., ribosomal RNA promoter), RNA polymerase II (e.g., CMV early promoter or actin promoter or U1 snRNA promoter) or generally RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g., U6 snRNA or 7SK RNA promoter) or a prokaryotic promoter, for example the T7 promoter, provided the expression plasmid also encodes T7 RNA polymerase required for transcription from a T7 promoter. The promoter can also direct transgene expression to the pancreas (see, e.g., the insulin regulatory sequence for pancreas (Bucchini et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:2511-2515)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, expression of the transgene can be precisely regulated, for example, by using an inducible regulatory sequence and expression systems such as a regulatory sequence that is sensitive to certain physiological regulators, e.g., circulating glucose levels, or hormones (Docherty et al., 1994, FASEB J. 8:20-24). Such inducible expression systems, suitable for the control of transgene expression in cells or in mammals include regulation by ecdysone, by estrogen, progesterone, tetracycline, chemical inducers of dimerization, and isopropyl-beta-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (EPTG). A person skilled in the art would be able to choose the appropriate regulatory/promoter sequence based on the intended use of the dsRNA transgene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, recombinant vectors capable of expressing dsRNA molecules are delivered as described below, and persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of dsRNA molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the dsRNAs bind to target RNA and modulate its function or expression. Delivery of dsRNA expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex-planted from the patient followed by reintroduction into the patient, or by any other means that allows for introduction into a desired target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndsRNA expression DNA plasmids are typically transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers (e.g., Oligofectamine) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g., Transit-TKOTM). Multiple lipid transfections for dsRNA-mediated knockdowns targeting different regions of a single SAA gene or multiple SAA genes over a period of a week or more are also contemplated by the invention. Successful introduction of vectors into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient transfection can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Stable transfection of cells ex vivo can be ensured using markers that provide the transfected cell with resistance to specific environmental factors (e.g., antibiotics and drugs), such as hygromycin B resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSAA specific dsRNA molecules can also be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors for human patients. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g., Chen et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3054-3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can include a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system.\n\n\n \nIII. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING dsRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing a dsRNA, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition containing the dsRNA is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of an SAA gene, such as pathological processes mediated by SAA expression. Such pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery, e.g., by intravenous (IV) delivery. Another example is compositions that are formulated for direct delivery into the brain parenchyma, e.g., by infusion into the brain, such as by continuous pump infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, a suitable dose of dsRNA will be in the range of 0.01 to 200.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range of 0.1 to 50 or 0.1 to 5.0 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example, the dsRNA can be administered at 0.01 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 0.7 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, 1.3 mg/kg, 1.4 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 1.6 mg/kg, 1.7 mg/kg, 1.8 mg/kg, 1.9 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg per single dose. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once daily or the dsRNA may be administered as two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release formulation. In that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art and are particularly useful for delivery of agents at a particular site, such as could be used with the agents of the present invention. In this embodiment, the dosage unit contains a corresponding multiple of the daily dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of a single dose on SAA levels (or both SAA1 and SAA2 levels) is long lasting, such that subsequent doses are administered at not more than 3, 4, or 5 day intervals, or at not more than 1, 2, 3, or 4 week intervals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions that can be delivered by injection directly into the brain. The injection can be by stereotactic injection into a particular region of the brain (e.g., the substantia nigra, cortex, hippocampus, striatum, or globus pallidus), or the dsRNA can be delivered into multiple regions of the central nervous system (e.g., into multiple regions of the brain, and/or into the spinal cord). The dsRNA can also be delivered into diffuse regions of the brain (e.g., diffuse delivery to the cortex of the brain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a dsRNA targeting SAA can be delivered by way of a cannula or other delivery device having one end implanted in a tissue, e.g., the brain, e.g., the substantia nigra, cortex, hippocampus, striatum, corpus callosum or globus pallidus of the brain. The cannula can be connected to a reservoir of the dsRNA composition. The flow or delivery can be mediated by a pump, e.g., an osmotic pump or minipump, such as an Alzet pump (Durect, Cupertino, Calif.). In one embodiment, a pump and reservoir are implanted in an area distant from the tissue, e.g., in the abdomen, and delivery is effected by a conduit leading from the pump or reservoir to the site of release. Infusion of the dsRNA composition into the brain can be over several hours or for several days, e.g., for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days or more. Devices for delivery to the brain are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,093,180, and 5,814,014.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of various human diseases, such as pathological processes mediated by SAA expression. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective dose. A suitable mouse model is, for example, a mouse containing a plasmid expressing human SAA1 or SAA2, e.g., from an adenoviral vector. Another suitable mouse model is a transgenic mouse carrying a transgene that expresses human SAA1 or SAA2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured in the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNAs featured in the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by target gene expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations which include the dsRNA compounds featured in the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical, pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal, oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intraparenchymal, intrathecal or intraventricular, administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. Suitable topical formulations include those in which the dsRNAs featured in the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Suitable lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g., dioleoylphosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g., dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g., dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). DsRNAs featured in the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, dsRNAs may be complexed to lipids, in particular to cationic lipids. Suitable fatty acids and esters include but are not limited to arachidonic acid, oleic acid, eicosanoic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a C1-10 alkyl ester (e.g., isopropylmyristate IPM), monoglyceride, diglyceride or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Topical formulations are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,747,014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions and formulations for oral administration include powders or granules, microparticulates, nanoparticulates, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, gel capsules, sachets, tablets or minitablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. In some embodiments, oral formulations are those in which dsRNAs featured in the invention are administered in conjunction with one or more penetration enhancers, surfactants, and chelators. Suitable surfactants include fatty acids and/or esters or salts thereof, bile acids and/or salts thereof. Suitable bile acids/salts include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxychenodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, glucholic acid, glycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate and sodium glycodihydrofusidate. Suitable fatty acids include arachidonic acid, undecanoic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a monoglyceride, a diglyceride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., sodium). In some embodiments, combinations of penetration enhancers are used, for example, fatty acids/salts in combination with bile acids/salts. One exemplary combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid, capric acid and UDCA. Further penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether. DsRNAs featured in the invention may be delivered orally, in granular form including sprayed dried particles, or complexed to form micro or nanoparticles. DsRNA complexing agents include poly-amino acids; polyimines; polyacrylates; polyalkylacrylates, polyoxethanes, polyalkylcyanoacrylates; cationized gelatins, albumins, starches, acrylates, polyethyleneglycols (PEG) and starches; polyalkylcyanoacrylates; DEAE-derivatized polyimines, pollulans, celluloses and starches.

Oral formulations for dsRNAs and their preparation are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,887,906, US Publn. No. 20030027780, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,747,014, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions and formulations for parenteral, intraparenchymal (into the brain), intrathecal, intraventricular or intrahepatic administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations. These compositions may be generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids. Particularly preferred are formulations that target the liver when treating hepatic disorders such as hepatic carcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomal Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many organized surfactant structures besides microemulsions that have been studied and used for the formulation of drugs. These include monolayers, micelles, bilayers and vesicles. Vesicles, such as liposomes, have attracted great interest because of their specificity and the duration of action they offer from the standpoint of drug delivery. As used in the present invention, the term “liposome” means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes are unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior. The aqueous portion contains the composition to be delivered. Cationic liposomes possess the advantage of being able to fuse to the cell wall. Non-cationic liposomes, although not able to fuse as efficiently with the cell wall, are taken up by macrophages in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to cross intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal gradient. Therefore, it is desirable to use a liposome which is highly deformable and able to pass through such fine pores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther advantages of liposomes include; liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid soluble drugs; liposomes can protect encapsulated drugs in their internal compartments from metabolism and degradation (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245). Important considerations in the preparation of liposome formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of action. Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when liposomes are applied to a tissue, the liposomes start to merge with the cellular membranes and as the merging of the liposome and cell progresses, the liposomal contents are emptied into the cell where the active agent may act.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomal formulations have been the focus of extensive investigation as the mode of delivery for many drugs. There is growing evidence that for topical administration, liposomes present several advantages over other formulations. Such advantages include reduced side-effects related to high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at the desired target, and the ability to administer a wide variety of drugs, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, into the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral reports have detailed the ability of liposomes to deliver agents including high-molecular weight DNA into the skin. Compounds including analgesics, antibodies, hormones and high-molecular weight DNAs have been administered to the skin. The majority of applications resulted in the targeting of the upper epidermis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes fall into two broad classes. Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with the negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex. The positively charged DNA/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is internalized in an endosome. Due to the acidic pH within the endosome, the liposomes are ruptured, releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (Wang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1987, 147, 980-985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes which are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged, entrap DNA rather than complex with it. Since both the DNA and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some DNA is entrapped within the aqueous interior of these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver DNA encoding the thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected in the target cells (Zhou et al., Journal of Controlled Release, 1992, 19, 269-274).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally-derived phosphatidylcholine. Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Anionic liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Another type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example, soybean PC, and egg PC. Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral studies have assessed the topical delivery of liposomal drug formulations to the skin. Application of liposomes containing interferon to guinea pig skin resulted in a reduction of skin herpes sores while delivery of interferon via other means (e.g., as a solution or as an emulsion) were ineffective (Weiner et al., Journal of Drug Targeting, 1992, 2, 405-410). Further, an additional study tested the efficacy of interferon administered as part of a liposomal formulation to the administration of interferon using an aqueous system, and concluded that the liposomal formulation was superior to aqueous administration (du Plessis et al., Antiviral Research, 1992, 18, 259-265).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol. Non-ionic liposomal formulations comprising Novasome™ I (glyceryl dilaurate/cholesterol/po-lyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasome™ II (glyceryl distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomal systems were effective in facilitating the deposition of cyclosporin-A into different layers of the skin (Hu et al. S.T.P.Pharma. Sci., 1994, 4, 6, 466).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes also include “sterically stabilized” liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome (A) comprises one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside G\nM1\n, or (B) is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized lipids, the enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilized liposomes derives from a reduced uptake into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Allen et al., FEBS Letters, 1987, 223, 42; Wu et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 3765).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious liposomes comprising one or more glycolipids are known in the art. Papahadjopoulos et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1987, 507, 64) reported the ability of monosialoganglioside GM1, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half-lives of liposomes. These findings were expounded upon by Gabizon et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1988, 85, 6949). U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,028 and WO 88/04924, both to Allen et al., disclose liposomes comprising (1) sphingomyelin and (2) the ganglioside GM1 or a galactocerebroside sulfate ester. U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.) discloses liposomes comprising sphingomyelin. Liposomes comprising 1,2-sn-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine are disclosed in WO 97/13499 (Lim et al).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany liposomes comprising lipids derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, and methods of preparation thereof, are known in the art. Sunamoto et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1980, 53, 2778) described liposomes comprising a nonionic detergent, 2C1215G, that contains a PEG moiety. Illum et al. (\nFEBS Lett., \n1984, 167, 79) noted that hydrophilic coating of polystyrene particles with polymeric glycols results in significantly enhanced blood half-lives. Synthetic phospholipids modified by the attachment of carboxylic groups of polyalkylene glycols (e.g., PEG) are described by Sears (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,426,330 and 4,534,899). Klibanov et al. (FEBS Lett., 1990, 268, 235) described experiments demonstrating that liposomes comprising phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) derivatized with PEG or PEG stearate have significant increases in blood circulation half-lives. Blume et al. (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1990, 1029, 91) extended such observations to other PEG-derivatized phospholipids, e.g., DSPE-PEG, formed from the combination of distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) and PEG. Liposomes having covalently bound PEG moieties on their external surface are described in European Patent No. \nEP\n 0 445 131 B1 and WO 90/04384 to Fisher. Liposome compositions containing 1-20 mole percent of PE derivatized with PEG, and methods of use thereof, are described by Woodle et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,556 and 5,356,633) and Martin et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,804 and European Patent No. \nEP\n 0 496 813 B1). Liposomes comprising a number of other lipid-polymer conjugates are disclosed in WO 91/05545 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,212 (both to Martin et al.) and in WO 94/20073 (Zalipsky et al.) Liposomes comprising PEG-modified ceramide lipids are described in WO 96/10391 (Choi et al). U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,935 (Miyazaki et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,948 (Tagawa et al.) describe PEG-containing liposomes that can be further derivatized with functional moieties on their surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of liposomes comprising nucleic acids are known in the art. WO 96/40062 to Thierry et al. discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,221 to Tagawa et al. discloses protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes may include a dsRNA. U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,710 to Rahman et al. describes certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. WO 97/04787 to Love et al. discloses liposomes comprising dsRNAs targeted to the raf gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfersomes are yet another type of liposomes, and are highly deformable lipid aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles. Transfersomes may be described as lipid droplets which are so highly deformable that they are easily able to penetrate through pores which are smaller than the droplet. Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in which they are used, e.g., they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self-repairing, frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading. To make transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition. Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin. The transfersome-mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a solution containing serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including microemulsions) and liposomes. The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB). The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the “head”) provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and are usable over a wide range of pH values. In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their structure. Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol esters, propylene glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated esters. Nonionic alkanolamides and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, propoxylated alcohols, and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class. The polyoxyethylene surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as anionic. Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps, acyl lactylates, acyl amides of amino acids, esters of sulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl isethionates, acyl taurates and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates. The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as cationic. Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts and ethoxylated amines. The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the surfactant is classified as amphoteric. Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives, substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSNALPs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a dsRNA featured in the invention is fully encapsulated in the lipid formulation to form a SPLP, pSPLP, SNALP, or other nucleic acid-lipid particle. As used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle, including SPLP. As used herein, the term “SPLP” refers to a nucleic acid-lipid particle comprising plasmid DNA encapsulated within a lipid vesicle. SNALPs and SPLPs typically contain a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and a lipid that prevents aggregation of the particle (e.g., a PEG-lipid conjugate). SNALPs and SPLPs are extremely useful for systemic applications, as they exhibit extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection and accumulate at distal sites (e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site). SPLPs include “pSPLP,” which include an encapsulated condensing agent-nucleic acid complex as set forth in PCT Publication No. WO 00/03683. The particles of the present invention typically have a mean diameter of about 50 nm to about 150 nm, more typically about 60 nm to about 130 nm, more typically about 70 nm to about 110 nm, most typically about 70 to about 90 nm, and are substantially nontoxic. In addition, the nucleic acids when present in the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present invention are resistant in aqueous solution to degradation with a nuclease. Nucleic acid-lipid particles and their method of preparation are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,976,567; 5,981,501; 6,534,484; 6,586,410; 6,815,432; and PCT Publication No. WO 96/40964.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lipid to drug ratio (mass/mass ratio) (e.g., lipid to dsRNA ratio) will be in the range of from about 1:1 to about 50:1, from about 1:1 to about 25:1, from about 3:1 to about 15:1, from about 4:1 to about 10:1, from about 5:1 to about 9:1, or about 6:1 to about 9:1, or 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, or 11:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cationic lipid may be, for example, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DODAC), N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP), N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), N,N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy)propylamine (DODMA), 1,2-DiLinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA), 1,2-Dilinolenyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLenDMA), 1,2-Dilinoleylcarbamoyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (Dlin-C-DAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyoxy-3-(dimethylamino)acetoxypropane (Dlin-DAC), 1,2-Dilinoleyoxy-3-morpholinopropane (Dlin-MA), 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDAP), 1,2-Dilinoleylthio-3-dimethylaminopropane (Dlin-S-DMA), 1-Linoleoyl-2-linoleyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (Dlin-2-DMAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (Dlin-TMA.C1), 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (Dlin-TAP.C1), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)propane (Dlin-MPZ), or 3-(N,N-Dilinoleylamino)-1,2-propanediol (DlinAP), 3-(N,N-Dioleylamino)-1,2-propanedio (DOAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxo-3-(2-N,N-dimethylamino)ethoxypropane (Dlin-EG-DMA), 1,2-Dilinolenyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA), 2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminomethyl[1,3]-dioxolane (Dlin-K-DMA) or analogs thereof, or a mixture thereof. The cationic lipid may comprise from about 20 mol % to about 60 mol % or about 40 mol %, 50 mol %, 51 mol %, 52 mol %, 53 mol %, 54 mol %, 55 mol %, 56 mol %, 57 mol %, 58 mol %, 59 mol %, or 60 mol %, of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the \ncationic lipid\n 2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane (Lipid A) can be used to prepare lipid-siRNA nanoparticles. Synthesis of 2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane (Lipid A) is described in U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/107,998 filed on Oct. 23, 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lipid-siRNA particle includes 40% 2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane (Lipid A): 10% DSPC: 40% Cholesterol: 10% PEG-C-DOMG (mole percent) with a particle size of 63.0±20 nm and a 0.027 siRNA/Lipid Ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe non-cationic lipid may be an anionic lipid or a neutral lipid including, but not limited to, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (DOPE-mal), dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DPPE), dimyristoylphosphoethanolamine (DMPE), distearoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DSPE), 16-O-monomethyl PE, 16-O-dimethyl PE, 18-1-trans PE, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (SOPE), cholesterol, or a mixture thereof. The non-cationic lipid may be from about 5 mol % to about 90 mol %, about 10 mol %, or about 58 mol % if cholesterol is included, of the total lipid present in the particle. In some embodiments the non-ationic lipid is around from about 7 mol % to about 8 mol %, or 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, or 8.0 mol %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of particles may be, for example, a polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-lipid including, without limitation, a PEG-diacylglycerol (DAG), a PEG-dialkyloxypropyl (DAA), a PEG-phospholipid, a PEG-ceramide (Cer), or a mixture thereof. The PEG-DAA conjugate may be, for example, a PEG-dilauryloxypropyl (Ci\n2\n), a PEG-dimyristyloxypropyl (Ci\n4\n), a PEG-dipalmityloxypropyl (Ci\n6\n), or a PEG-distearyloxypropyl (C]\n8\n). The conjugated lipid that prevents aggregation of particles may be from 0 mol % to about 20 mol % or about 2 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the nucleic acid-lipid particle further includes cholesterol at, e.g., about 10 mol % to about 60 mol % or about 48 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLNP01\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lipidoid ND98.4 HCl (MW 1487) (Formula 1), Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich), and PEG-Ceramide C16 (Avanti Polar Lipids) can be used to prepare lipid-siRNA nanoparticles (i.e., LNP01 particles). Stock solutions of each in ethanol can be prepared as follows: ND98, 133 mg/ml; Cholesterol, 25 mg/ml, PEG-Ceramide C16, 100 mg/ml. The ND98, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide C16 stock solutions can then be combined in a, e.g., 42:48:10 molar ratio. The combined lipid solution can be mixed with aqueous siRNA (e.g., in sodium acetate pH 5) such that the final ethanol concentration is about 35-45% and the final sodium acetate concentration is about 100-300 mM. Lipid-siRNA nanoparticles typically form spontaneously upon mixing. Depending on the desired particle size distribution, the resultant nanoparticle mixture can be extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (e.g., 100 nm cut-off) using, for example, a thermobarrel extruder, such as Lipex Extruder (Northern Lipids, Inc). In some cases, the extrusion step can be omitted. Ethanol removal and simultaneous buffer exchange can be accomplished by, for example, dialysis or tangential flow filtration. Buffer can be exchanged with, for example, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at about pH 7, e.g., about pH 6.9, about pH 7.0, about pH 7.1, about pH 7.2, about pH 7.3, or about pH 7.4.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLNP01 formulations are described, e.g., in International Application Publication No. WO 2008/042973, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional exemplary lipid-siRNA formulations are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ncationic lipid/non-cationic\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid/choleseterol/PEG-lipid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nconjugate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCationic Lipid\n\n\nLipid:siRNA ratio\n\n\nProcess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNALP\n\n\n1,2-Dilinolenyloxy-N,N-\n\n\nDLinDMA/DPPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA)\n\n\ncDMA (57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid:siRNA ~7:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNALP-\n\n\n2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-\n\n\nLIPID A/DPPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIPID A\n\n\n[1,3]-dioxolane (LIPID A)\n\n\ncDMA 57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid:siRNA ~7:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP05\n\n\n2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-\n\n\nLIPID A/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nExtrusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[1,3]-dioxolane (LIPID A)\n\n\nDMG 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid:siRNA ~6:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP06\n\n\n2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-\n\n\nLIPID A/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nExtrusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[1,3]-dioxolane (LIPID A)\n\n\nDMG 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid:siRNA ~11:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP07\n\n\n2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-\n\n\nLIPID A/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nIn-line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[1,3]-dioxolane (LIPID A)\n\n\nDMG 60/7.5/31/1.5,\n\n\nmixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid:siRNA ~6:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP08\n\n\n2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-\n\n\nLIPID A/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nIn-line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[1,3]-dioxolane (LIPID A)\n\n\nDMG 60/7.5/31/1.5,\n\n\nmixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlipid:siRNA ~11:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-\n\n\nLIPID A/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nIn-line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[1,3]-dioxolane (LIPID A)\n\n\nDMG 50/10/38.5/1.5\n\n\nmixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLipid:siRNA 10:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP10\n\n\n(3aR,5s,6aS)-N,N-dimethyl-2,2-\n\n\nALN100/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nIn-line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndi((9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-\n\n\nDMG\n\n\nmixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndienyl)tetrahydro-3aH-\n\n\n50/10/38.5/1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncyclopenta[d][1,3]dioxol-5-amine\n\n\nLipid:siRNA 10:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(ALN100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP11\n\n\n(6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z)-heptatriaconta-\n\n\nMC-3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nIn-line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6,9,28,31-tetraen-19-yl 4-\n\n\nDMG\n\n\nmixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(dimethylamino)butanoate (MC3)\n\n\n50/10/38.5/1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLipid:siRNA 10:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP12\n\n\n1,1′-(2-(4-(2-((2-(bis(2-\n\n\nTech G1/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-\n\n\nIn-line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhydroxydodecyl)amino)ethyl)(2-\n\n\nDMG\n\n\nmixing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhydroxydodecyl)amino)ethyl)piperazin-\n\n\n50/10/38.5/1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-yl)ethylazanediyl)didodecan-2-ol\n\n\nLipid:siRNA 10:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(Tech G1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas. The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmulsions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be prepared and formulated as emulsions. Emulsions are typically heterogenous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 μm in diameter (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nVolume\n 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions may be of either the water-in-oil (w/o) or the oil-in-water (o/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase, the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions may contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug which may be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants may also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions may also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o/w/o emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers may broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 285; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins, sterols and phosphatides that may readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used may be free radical scavengers such as tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and lecithin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of ease of formulation, as well as efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been administered orally as o/w emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of dsRNAs and nucleic acids are formulated as microemulsions. A microemulsion may be defined as a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245). Typically microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. Therefore, microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids that are stabilized by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (Leung and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M., Ed., 1989, VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215). Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a combination of three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and electrolyte. Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and on the structure and geometric packing of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules (Schott, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 271).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenomenological approach utilizing phase diagrams has been extensively studied and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate microemulsions (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245; Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 335). Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water-insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (MO750), decaglycerol sesquioleate (SO750), decaglycerol decaoleate (DAO750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules. Microemulsions may, however, be prepared without the use of cosurfactants and alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art. The aqueous phase may typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug, glycerol, PEG300, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol. The oil phase may include, but is not limited to, materials such as Captex 300, Captex 355, Capmul MCM, fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and tri-glycerides, polyoxyethylated glyceryl fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C10 glycerides, vegetable oils and silicone oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and the enhanced absorption of drugs. Lipid based microemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385-1390; Ritschel, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 1993, 13, 205). Microemulsions afford advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms, improved clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385; Ho et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1996, 85, 138-143). Often microemulsions may form spontaneously when their components are brought together at ambient temperature. This may be particularly advantageous when formulating thermolabile drugs, peptides or dsRNAs. Microemulsions have also been effective in the transdermal delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. It is expected that the microemulsion compositions and formulations of the present invention will facilitate the increased systemic absorption of dsRNAs and nucleic acids from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the local cellular uptake of dsRNAs and nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions of the present invention may also contain additional components and additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the dsRNAs and nucleic acids of the present invention. Penetration enhancers used in the microemulsions of the present invention may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories—surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of these classes has been discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPenetration Enhancers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to affect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly dsRNAs, to the skin of animals. Most drugs are present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms. However, usually only lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes. It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs may cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer. In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPenetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of the above mentioned classes of penetration enhancers are described below in greater detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants: In connection with the present invention, surfactants (or “surface-active agents”) are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of dsRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. In addition to bile salts and fatty acids, these penetration enhancers include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43. Takahashi et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatty acids: Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glycerol 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, C.sub.1-10 alkyl esters thereof (e.g., methyl, isopropyl and t-butyl), and mono- and di-glycerides thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; El Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651-654).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBile salts: The physiological role of bile includes the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (Brunton, Chapter 38 in: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9\nth \nEd., Hardman et al. Eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, pp. 934-935). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers. Thus the term “bile salts” includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives. Suitable bile salts include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate), glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate), taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate), chenodeoxycholic acid (sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Swinyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990, pages 782-783; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Yamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263, 25; Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1990, 79, 579-583).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChelating Agents: Chelating agents, as used in connection with the present invention, can be defined as compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of dsRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. With regards to their use as penetration enhancers in the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as Dnase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, J. Chromatogr., 1993, 618, 315-339). Suitable chelating agents include but are not limited to disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines)(Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Buur et al., J. Control Rel., 1990, 14, 43-51).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-chelating non-surfactants: As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration enhancing compounds can be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of dsRNAs through the alimentary mucosa (Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33). This class of penetration enhancers include, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621-626).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents that enhance uptake of dsRNAs at the cellular level may also be added to the pharmaceutical and other compositions of the present invention. For example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al., PCT Application WO 97/30731), are also known to enhance the cellular uptake of dsRNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids, including glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones, and terpenes such as limonene and menthone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarriers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compositions of the present invention also incorporate carrier compounds in the formulation. As used herein, “carrier compound” or “carrier” can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog thereof, which is inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se) but is recognized as a nucleic acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by, for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation. The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver, kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier compound and the nucleic acid for a common receptor. For example, the recovery of a partially phosphorothioate dsRNA in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfate, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4′ isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Miyao et al., DsRNA Res. Dev., 1995, 5, 115-121; Takakura et al., DsRNA & Nucl. Acid Drug Dev., 1996, 6, 177-183.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcipients\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to a carrier compound, a “pharmaceutical carrier” or “excipient” is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal. The excipient may be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.); and wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipient suitable for non-parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can also be used to formulate the compositions of the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for topical administration of nucleic acids may include sterile and non-sterile aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions in common solvents such as alcohols, or solutions of the nucleic acids in liquid or solid oil bases. The solutions may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non-parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohol, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Components\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include (a) one or more dsRNA compounds and (b) one or more anti-cytokine biologic agents which function by a non-RNAi mechanism. Examples of such biologics include, biologics that target IL1β (e.g., anakinra), IL6 (tocilizumab), or TNF (etanercept, infliximab, adlimumab, or certolizumab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include (a) one or more dsRNA compounds and (b) one or more other chemotherapeutic agents which function by a non-RNAi mechanism. Examples of such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to daunorubicin, daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin, mafosfamide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone, hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, tamoxifen, dacarbazine, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, chlorambucil, methylcyclohexylnitrosurea, nitrogen mustards, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, deoxycoformycin, 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphor-amide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FudR), methotrexate (MTX), colchicine, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide (VP-16), trimetrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, teniposide, cisplatin and diethylstilbestrol (DES). See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15\nth \nEd. 1987, pp. 1206-1228, Berkow et al., eds., Rahway, N.J. When used with the dsRNAs featured in the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide), sequentially (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide for a period of time followed by MTX and oligonucleotide), or in combination with one or more other such chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 5-FU, MTX and oligonucleotide, or 5-FU, radiotherapy and oligonucleotide). Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs, including but not limited to ribivirin, vidarabine, acyclovir and ganciclovir, may also be combined in compositions featured in the invention. See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed., Berkow et al., eds., 1987, Rahway, N.J., pages 2499-2506 and 46-49, respectively). Other non-RNAi chemotherapeutic agents are also within the scope of this invention. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulation a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured in the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to their administration, as discussed above, the dsRNAs featured in the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by SAA expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.\n\n\n \nMethods for Treating Diseases Caused by Expression of an SAA Gene\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates in particular to the use of a dsRNA targeting SAA and compositions containing at least one such dsRNA for the treatment of an SAA-mediated disorder or disease. For example, a dsRNA targeting an SAA gene, e.g., one or both of SAA1 and SAA2, can be useful for the treatment of a disorder associated with inflammation, such as arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), or tissue injury, reactive (secondary) amyloidosis or systemic amyloidosis, atherosclerosis, or Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dsRNA targeting an SAA gene is also used for treatment of symptoms and disorders, such as chronic inflammatory diseases, chronic infections, and neoplasia. Such disorders are frequently associated with amyloidosis. Examples of chronic inflammatory diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, Adult Still's disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), and hereditary periodic fevers, such as Familial Mediterranean fever. Examples of chronic infections associated with amyloidosis, and suitable for treatment with SAA dsRNAs, include tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, leprosy, pyelonephritis, decubitus ulcers, Whipple's disease, acne conglobata, common variable immunodeficiency hypo/agammaglobulinemia, cystic fibrosis. Examples of neoplasia associated with amyloidosis, and suitable for treatment with SAA dsRNAs, include hepatoma, renal carcinoma, Castleman's disease, Hodgkin's disease, Adult hairy cell leukemia, and Waldenström's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a dsRNA targeting an SAA gene is used to treat clinical disorders such as proteinuria/renal insufficiency, diarrhea/obstipation/malabsorption, goiter, neuropathy/carpal tunnel syndrome, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, cardiac. These disorders are frequently present in patients with amyloidosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dsRNA targeting an SAA gene can also be used to treat a proliferative disorder, such as cancer, such as colon cancer. A composition containing a dsRNA targeting an SAA gene is also used to treat a carcinoma of the breast, ovary, cervix, kidney, or a squamous cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition containing a dsRNA targeting SAA, e.g., one or both of SAA1 or SAA2, may also be used to treat other tumors and cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, abdominal cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, tongue cancer, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer (e.g., squamous carcinoma of the cervix), lymphoid tumor, retinoblastoma, Wilm's tumor, multiple myeloma and for the treatment of skin cancer, like melanoma, for the treatment of lymphomas and blood cancer. The compositions featured herein can be used to treat a tumor of the brain or spine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dsRNA targeting SAA may be used to treat a proliferative disorder or differentiative disorder. Examples of cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, metastatic disorders or hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, e.g., leukemias. A metastatic tumor can arise from a multitude of primary tumor types, including those of prostate, colon, lung, breast and liver origin. As used herein, the terms “cancer,” “hyperproliferative,” and “neoplastic” refer to cells having the capacity for autonomous growth, i.e., an abnormal state of condition characterized by rapidly proliferating cell growth. These terms are meant to include all types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes, metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed cells, tissues, or organs, irrespective of histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. Proliferative disorders also include hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, including diseases involving hyperplastic/neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin, e.g., arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOwing to the inhibitory effects on SAA expression, a composition according to the invention or a pharmaceutical composition prepared therefrom can enhance the quality of life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to the use of a dsRNA or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, e.g., for treating an amyloidosis, in combination with other pharmaceuticals and/or other therapeutic methods, e.g., with known pharmaceuticals and/or known therapeutic methods, such as, for example, those which are currently employed for treating this disorders. In one example, a dsRNA targeting SAA can be administered in combination with an anti-cytokine agent such as an anti-IL1β agent (e.g., anakinra), IL6 agent (e.g., tocilizumab), or TNFα agent (e.g., etanercept, infliximab, adlimumab, or certolizumab). In other examples, a dsRNA targeting SAA can be administered in combination with rituxan (rituximab), Eprodisate (Neurochem, Canada). In yet other examples, a dsRNA targeting SAA can be administered in combination with steroids or methotrexate, e.g., to manage chronic inflammatory arthritis. In other examples, a dsRNA targeting SAA can be administered in combination with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, e.g., for management of renal function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to the use of a dsRNA or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, e.g., for treating a cancer, in combination with other pharmaceuticals and/or other therapeutic methods, e.g., with known pharmaceuticals and/or known therapeutic methods, such as, for example, those which are currently employed for treating these disorders. In one example, administration of a dsRNA targeting SAA can be administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent, such as temozolomide, deoxycoformycin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, daunorubicin, tamoxifen aunorubicin, daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin, mafosfamide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone, hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, tamoxifen, dacarbazine, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, chlorambucil, methylcyclohexylnitrosurea, nitrogen mustards, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, deoxycoformycin, 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphoramide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FudR), methotrexate (MTX), colchicine, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide (VP-16), trimetrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, teniposide, cisplatin and diethylstilbestrol (DES). See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15\nth \nEd. 1987, pp. 1206-1228, Berkow et al., eds., Rahway, N.J. When used with the dsRNAs featured in the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually, sequentially (e.g., dsRNA for a period of time, followed by chemotherapy), or in combination with one or more other such agents (e.g., chemotherapy and dsRNA). Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA and an additional therapeutic agent can be administered in the same combination, e.g., parenterally, or the additional therapeutic agent can be administered as part of a separate composition or by another method described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment with a dsRNA targeting SAA can also be performed in combination with radiation therapy, such as for treatment of a cancer, such as colon cancer or a carcinoma. A dsRNA featured herein may be administered before or after a surgical procedure to treat a cancer (e.g., to remove a tumor, or a malignant cell or cell mass).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention features a method of administering a dsRNA targeting SAA to a patient having a disease or disorder mediated by SAA expression, such as AA amyloidosis. Administration of the dsRNA can stabilize and improve renal function, for example, in a patient with AA amyloidosis. Patients can be administered a therapeutic amount of dsRNA, such as 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg/kg dsRNA. The dsRNA can be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of time, such as over a 5 minute, 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute, or 25 minute period. The administration is repeated, for example, on a regular basis, such as biweekly (i.e., every two weeks) for one month, two months, three months, four months or longer. After an initial treatment regimen, the treatments can be administered on a less frequent basis. For example, after administration biweekly for three months, administration can be repeated once per month, for six months or a year or longer. Administration of the dsRNA can reduce serum SAA levels in the patient by at least 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBefore administration of a full dose of the dsRNA, patients can be administered a smaller dose, such as a 5% infusion reaction, and monitored for adverse effects, such as an allergic reaction or a change in liver function. For example, in patients monitored for changes in liver function, a low incidence of LFT (Liver Function Test) change (e.g., a 10-20% incidence of LFT) is acceptable (e.g., a reversible, 3-fold increase in ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and/or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) levels).\n\n\n \nMethods for Inhibiting Expression of an SAA Gene\n\n\n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the expression of an SAA gene in a mammal. The method includes administering a composition featured in the invention to the mammal such that expression of the target SAA gene (e.g., one or both of SAA1 and SAA2) is silenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the organism to be treated is a mammal such as a human, the composition may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intracranial (e.g., intraventricular, intraparenchymal and intrathecal), intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), nasal, rectal, and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration. In certain embodiments, the compositions are administered by intravenous infusion or injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the dsRNAs and methods featured in the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\ndsRNA Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nSource of Reagents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the source of a reagent is not specifically given herein, such reagent may be obtained from any supplier of reagents for molecular biology at a quality/purity standard for application in molecular biology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle-stranded RNAs are produced by solid phase synthesis on a scale of 1 μmole using an Expedite 8909 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and controlled pore glass (CPG, 500 Å, Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) as solid support. RNA and RNA containing 2′-O-methyl nucleotides are generated by solid phase synthesis employing the corresponding phosphoramidites and 2′-O-methyl phosphoramidites, respectively (Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). These building blocks are incorporated at selected sites within the sequence of the oligoribonucleotide chain using standard nucleoside phosphoramidite chemistry such as described in Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA. Phosphorothioate linkages are introduced by replacement of the iodine oxidizer solution with a solution of the Beaucage reagent (Chruachem Ltd, Glasgow, UK) in acetonitrile (1%). Further ancillary reagents are obtained from Mallinckrodt Baker (Griesheim, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeprotection and purification of the crude oligoribonucleotides by anion exchange HPLC are carried out according to established procedures. Yields and concentrations are determined by UV absorption of a solution of the respective RNA at a wavelength of 260 nm using a spectral photometer (DU 640B, Beckman Coulter GmbH, Unterschleiβheim, Germany). Double stranded RNA is generated by mixing an equimolar solution of complementary strands in annealing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8; 100 mM sodium chloride), heated in a water bath at 85-90° C. for 3 minutes and cooled to room temperature over a period of 3-4 hours.

The design used the SAA1 transcript NM\n—\n000331.3 (human), NM\n—\n009117.3 (mouse), and the single, near full length, SAA-like trace from cynomolgus monkey, the cDNA sequence Mfa#S27795076 (\nMacaca fascicularis\n). The SAA2 transcripts used in designing the siRNAs included NM\n—\n030754.2 (human) and NM\n—\n011314.1 (mouse).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA duplexes were designed with 100% identity to both SAA1 and SAA2 genes. Several sets cross-reactive with human and mouse, human and cynomolgus monkey and human-cynomolgus monkey were designed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll possible 19mers were created from each sequence. Human-mouse, human-cynomolgus monkey, and human-cynomolgus monkey-mouse subsets were created by searching for identical 19mers from each species using the Python script polyFastaToNmer.py. There were 254 human sense 19mer siRNAs. Of these 254, there were 21 with 100% identity to the human and mouse transcripts; 78 had 100% identity in human and cynomolgus monkey, and two had 100% identity in the three species (human, cynomolgus monkey, and mouse).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe predicted specificity of each siRNA design was used as a criterion for final selection. The SAA siRNAs were used in a comprehensive search against the mouse, human and cynomolgus transcriptomes using the FASTA algorithm. A Python script was then used to parse the alignments and generate a score based on the position and number of mismatches between the siRNA and any potential ‘off-target’ transcript. The score is weighted to emphasize differences in the ‘seed’ region of siRNAs, in positions 2-9 from the 5′ end of the molecule. Both siRNAs strands were assigned to a category of specificity according to the calculated scores: a score above 3 qualifies as highly specific, equal to 3 as specific and between 2.2 and 2.8 as moderate specific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 500-700 19-mer SAA siRNAs were designed and analyzed for SAA isoform/species cross-reactivity and off-target prediction. 78 dsRNAs were selected for further analysis. These 78 siRNAs were predicted to target both SAA1 and SAA2 (hereafter called “SAA” or “SAA½”). All 78 sense and antisense human-cynomolgus monkey-specific siRNAs were synthesized with internal 2′Ome modifications and formed into duplexes.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nIn Vitro Efficacy Screening of Serum Amyloid A (SAA)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 78 SAA siRNAs with 2′OM endo light modifications were screened for efficacy in an in vitro model.

The plate was washed three times after labeling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor signal detection, 100 ul of 2.0 Substrate was added to each well and the plate was read in the luminometer after 5 to 15 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman SAA-TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems). The Taqman assay used to measure SAA-RNA. All Taqman probes used for the Taqman assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The ABI 7900 HT and 7000 cyclers were used for processing and reading of assay plates. No RT PCR control should be run to check for any unspecific amplification or DNA contamination of the RNA used for the Reverse Transcription step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe master mix was prepared by combining 10 μl PCR Gene Expression Master mix (Applied Biosystems, ABI), 6 μl of Nuclease-free Water, 1 ul SAA probe designed to detect both SAA1 and SAA2 (Hs00761940_s1, Applied Biosystems) and 1 ul from both 18 s endogenous control probe and 2 ul RT cDNA/add later for a total 20 ul reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n18 μl of the master mix was aliquoted into each well and then 2 μl of cDNA RT product was added and mixed by pipetting up and down. The plate was sealed with AB Optic tape and processed with a Real Time PCR instrument. Readings were taken on an ABI 7900 HT real time PCR instrument after which data was analyzed and evaluated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman SAA-ELISA KIT Assay (Abazyme, LLC Cat # EL10015). A Human SAA-ELISA assay was used to determine human serum amyloid A (SAA) protein in cell culture supernatant. Kit reagents were allowed to reach room temperature before using. An SAA Standard was reconstituted with 2.0 mL of Calibrator Diluent II (80 ng/ml)., and the solution allowed to sit for at least 15 minutes with gentle agitation prior to making dilutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stock solution was used to produce a serial 2-fold dilution series within the range of the assay (2.5 ng/mL to 80 ng/mL). The undiluted SAA Standard served as the high standard (80 ng/mL) and the Calibrator Diluent served as the zero.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSupernatant samples from cells treated with siRNA and SAA induced one day later by IL1b+IL-6 and after 46 post induction were used, and supernates were diluted 1:3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1× Wash Buffer (1:19 of distilled or deionized water) was prepared. Substrate A and Substrate B were mixed together in \nequal volumes\n 15 minutes before use (need 14 ml total 7 ml each/plate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo perform the assay, 100 μl of standard or sample were added to the appropriate well of a pre-coated microtiter plate with SAA specific monoclonal antibody. The plate was covered and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate was washed with 1× wash buffer (350 ul/well) five times. 100 μl of HRP-conjugate—polyclonal antibody specific for SAA was then added to each well. The plate was covered and incubated for one hour at room temperature, and the wash procedure was repeated five times. 100 μL TMB (3,3′5,5′ tetramethyl-benzidine) substrate solution was added to each well. The plates were then covered and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. An SAA and enzyme-substrate reaction exhibit a change in color.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme-substrate reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl stop solution (sulphuric acid) to each well and mixing well. The Optical Density (O.D.) at 450±2 nm was measured within 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer (a microtiter plate) reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nSAA\n 2′-Ome duplex RNAs in Table 2 were synthesized; each strand included a phosphate link connecting adjacent 3′ dT molecules.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbols used in Table

Thirteen of the tested siRNA showed >90% inhibition of mRNA levels, 30 siRNA showed >80% inhibition, and 60 siRNA showed >50% inhibition. More than 30 of the 78 candidate siRNA reduced protein levels by >95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThirty-two of the 78 siRNA were selected for dose response and PBMC cytokine characterization. Selection was based on activity in single dose response experiment and on cross reactivity across species in order to assay duplexes with human only activity, human/cyno activity, human/mouse activity, and human/mouse/cyno activity.

The shaded siRNAs in Table 5 were selected for further analysis in serum stability assays, in in vivo efficacy studies in mice, and for off-target effects. Selection was based on the best IC50 in each class of cross-reactivities; human/cyno was weighted heavier as it was the likeliest to produce a lead molecule, as molecules in this class had great IC50 and would allow preclinical testing in NHP.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of second round screen of SAA siRNAs in in vitro model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIn Vivo Mouse Model for Testing SAA siRNAs\n\n\n \n \n \nAn in vivo mouse model for testing SAA siRNAs was established. Mice (n=5) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a concentration of 50 ug on \nday\n 0. Mice were bled on day −3 and \nday\n 1 following LPS injection and relative mouse SAA OD levels were measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n shows that SAA levels were increased in all mice tested 24 hours after LPS injection compared to pre-LPS injection SAA levels. Similar SAA upregulation was achieved with 10 ug of LPS injected i.p. (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test whether SAA siRNA can downregulate SAA levels in vivo, mice were administered siRNA i.v. 6 hours after LPS injection (10 ug i.p.).

Therefore, SAA siRNAs can be tested in mice expressing human SAA1 or SAA2 from a plasmid and/or from adenovirus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn adenovirus expressing hSAA1 was engineered with a CMV immediate early promoter and enhancer to drive expression of hSAA1 (Hosai et al., JLR 1999). Mice were pre-bled and then administered 4-12×10\n9 \npfu/mouse. Mice were then bled on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 4, 8, 11, 15, and 22 following the virus administration on \nday\n 0. \nFIG. 7\n shows that expression of hSAA1 can last for approximately 2 weeks after a single injection of virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrodynamic injection was also be used to express human SAA genes in mice (Nguyen et al., J. Surg. Res., 148:1, July 2008, p. 60-66; and Herweijer et al., J. Gene Med., 3:3, 2001, p. 280-291). A construct was designed for hepatocyte-specific hSAA1 expression in mice (\nFIG. 8\n). Mice (n=3) were injected via tail vein with 50 ug of the construct plasmid in approximately 2 ml of saline solution in approximately 10 seconds. The expression of hSAA1 in mice following hydrodynamic injection is shown in \nFIG. 9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNAs can also be tested in mice expressing human SAA1 or SAA2 from a transgene. Transgenic mice can express the human SAA gene constitutively and for a longer period of time. A construct that was designed for hSAA1 transgene expression is shown in \nFIG. 10\n (Postic and Magnuson, Genesis, 2000 February; 26(2):149-150.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNAs can be tested in non-human primate (NHP) models using endogenous SAA expression. Reagents to detect NHP SAA mRNA and protein levels are validated, and then levels of circulating SAA in resting and disease states are determined before administering the candidate siRNAs.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nInhibition of SAA Expression in Humans\n\n\n \n \n \nA human subject is treated with a dsRNA targeted to a SAA gene to inhibit expression of the SAA gene for an extended period of time following a single dose to treat a condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject in need of treatment is selected or identified. The subject can have AA amyloidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, a neoplasm, psoriatic arthritis, chronic juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, adult Still's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary periodic fevers, tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, leprosy, pyelonephritis, decubitus ulcers, Whipple's disease, acne conglobata, common variable immunodeficiency hypo/agammaglobulinemia, cystic fibrosis, hepatoma, renal carcinoma, Castleman's disease, Hodgkin's disease, adult hairy cell leukemia, Waldenström's disease, a neoplasm, a chronic infections, a chronic inflammatory disease, chronic arthritis, chronic sepsis, a periodic fever syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, or Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of the subject can occur in a clinical setting, or elsewhere, e.g., in the subject's home through the subject's own use of a self-testing kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt time zero, a suitable first dose of an anti-SAA siRNA is subcutaneously administered to the subject. The dsRNA is formulated as described herein. After a period of time following the first dose, e.g., 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days, the subject's condition is evaluated, e.g., by measuring temperature or one or more inflammation biomarkers. This measurement can be accompanied by a measurement of SAA expression in said subject, and/or the products of the successful siRNA-targeting of SAA mRNA. Other relevant criteria can also be measured. The number and strength of doses are adjusted according to the subject's needs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter treatment, the subject's temperature and/or inflammation biomarker(s) are lowered relative to the levels existing prior to the treatment, or relative to the levels measured in a similarly afflicted but untreated subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments are in the claims."

A therapeutic agent for the treatment of B-cell mediated diseases, comprising as an active ingredient the humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody according to \nclaim 1\n. Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nCD20 is a protein not containing sugar chains, which is expressed on the cellular surface of human B-lymphocytes. CD20 is expressed on many malignant tumor B-cells, in addition to normal B-cells in the peripheral blood, spleen, tonsils, and bone marrow. Epitopes to which monoclonal antibodies directed to CD20 bind are extremely highly varied and a wide variety of biological responses have been reported. Furthermore, there have been many reports of monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD20. Among them, rituximab is a chimerized mouse/human monoclonal antibody (C2B8), which is derived from a mouse antibody 2B8 obtained by immunization of an SB cell strain, a type of human B-cell (see \nPatent Documents\n 1 and 2). Rituximab has been actually used under the name Rituxan® as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of low malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Since then, it has been further reported that Rituxan is effective against many immune diseases related to B-cells, for example, malignant tumors, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CCL), autoimmune diseases involving pathogenic autoantibodies, such as autoimmune hemolyticanemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (see Non-Patent \nDocuments\n 1 to 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been reported that rituximab binds to human complements, resulting in lysis of B-cells of the lymphatic linenage by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (see Non-Patent Document 5), and that rituximab displays activity in assays for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and growth inhibiting activity and apoptosis induction in tritiated thymidine incorporation assays (see Non-Patent Document 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimera molecules with molecules from different animal species are antigenic and therefore are generally not desirable as therapeutic agents, while it has been believed that anti-CD20 antibodies, including rituximab, are not antigenic since they target and eliminate all types of B-cells, including normal cells. However, it has been reported that there are cases where rituximab induces neutralizing antibodies, albeit at several percent, during therapy, and the possibility of inducing neutralizing antibodies may further increase depending on its dosage amount and duration. In addition, there is an increased focus on problems associated with antigenicity, in the course of extending the target to be treated from B-cell lymphomas to RA, IT, and MS. For these reasons, there has been a recent need for human antibodies or humanized antibodies containing sequences more similar to human sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimerized antibodies entail the problem that they have relatively short half-lives in blood. The β half-life (β ½) of chimerized mouse/human antibodies, including rituximab, is no more than 3 to 4 days. The efficacy in clinical trials of rituximab against low malignant NHL has been reported to be a little less than 50% (see Non-Patent Document 7). Furthermore, there is a problem that amounts of rituximab to be administered in NHL therapy are increased, since the dissociation constant (Kd value) of rituximab for the CD20 antigen is 5.2 nM and the binding affinity is not very high (see Non-Patent Document 8).\n\n \n \n \n[Patent Document 1]: International Publication No. WO 94/11026 pamphlet\n \n[Patent Document 2]: U.S. Pat.

In this specification, however, the dissociation constant is taken to be one obtained by the method described hereinafter in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferable that growth inhibiting activity of the antibody of the present invention against cells expressing human CD20 antigen is greater than that of 2B8. The growth inhibiting activity preferably is a growth inhibiting activity with respect to in vitro cultures of cells expressing human CD20 antigen, in the absence of peripheral blood monocytes, more preferably, a growth inhibiting activity due to apoptosis induction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements of the growth inhibiting activity as described above can be made, for example, using the method described in Miyamoto T, Min W, Lillehoj H S. Avian Dis., 2002 January-March; 46(1):10-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific examples of monoclonal antibodies according to the first embodiment of the present invention include a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody wherein the amino acid sequence of the L-chain variable region and the amino acid sequence of the H-chain variable region are set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 1 and 9, SEQ ID Nos: 2 and 10, or SEQ ID Nos: 3 and 11, respectively, and chimerized or humanized variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimerization can be carried out, for example, by fusing an amino acid sequence from the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody with an amino acid sequence from the constant region of human immunoglobulin, according to known methods as described in Ishida T, Imai K, Nippon Rinsho, Vol. 60, No. 3, 2002-3:439-444.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanization can be carried out, for example, by using the CDR amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody and the amino acid sequence of human immunoglobulin, according to known methods as described in Ishida T, Imai K, Nippon Rinsho, Vol. 60, No. 3, 2002-3:439-444, and also in Eduardo A. Padlan, Molecular Immunology, Vol. 28-4/5, pp. 489-498, 1991; Eduardo A. Padlan et. al., The EASES Journal, vol. 9, pp. 133-139; and Tai to Wu, Elvin A. Kabat, Molecular Immunology, Vol. 29-9, pp. 1141-1146, 1992.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen chimerization or humanization is carried out, one may combine, in any combination, an amino acid sequence from the L-chain variable region and an amino acid sequence from the H-chain variable region of a plurality of mouse monoclonal antibodies. Examples include, for example, chimerized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies combining the L-chain which has a chimerized amino acid sequence from the amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 1 to 3 and the H-chain which has a chimerized amino acid sequence from the amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 9 to 11; and humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies combining the L-chain which has a humanized amino acid sequence of the CDR amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 1 to 3 and the H-chain which has a humanized amino acid sequence of the CDR the amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 9 to 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody according to a preferred, second embodiment of the present invention is a mouse-derived chimerized or humanized monoclonal antibody which has a dissociation constant (Kd value) for Raji cells, which are floating cells, of not more than one eighth of the Kd value of 2B8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known that when antibodies having high affinity for human CD20 antigen and containing, in particular, human IgG1 or IgG3 sequence, or an human Fc sequence modified therefrom (including chimerized or humanized versions of mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies) bind to CD20 on the cell surface, they induce activation of effector cells via FcγRIII (CD16) on NM cells, resulting in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). It is well known that when antibodies having high affinity for humanized CD20 antigen and containing, in particular, human IgG or IgM sequence, or a human Fc sequence modified form (including chimerized or humanized versions of mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies) bind to CD20 on the cell surface, they induce activation of complements, resulting in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, antibodies according to the second embodiment of the present invention can be expected to have a low or undetected growth-inhibiting activity and to display ADCC or CDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific examples of antibodies according to the second embodiment of the present invention include antibodies wherein the amino acid sequence of the L-chain variable region and the amino acid sequence of the H-chain variable region are set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 4 and 12, SEQ ID Nos: 5 and 13, SEQ ID Nos: 6 and 14, SEQ ID Nos: 7 and 15, or SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 16, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimerization or humanization can be carried out by similar methods as in the antibodies according to the first embodiment. One may combine, in may combination, an amino acid sequence from the L-chain variable region and an amino acid sequence from the H-chain variable region of a plurality of mouse monoclonal antibodies. Examples include, for example, chimerized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies combining the L-chain which has a chimerized amino acid sequence from the amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 4 to 8 and the H-chain which has a chimerized amino acid sequence from the amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 12 to 16; and humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies combining the L-chain which has a humanized amino acid sequence of the CDR amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 4 to 8 and the H-chain which has a humanized amino acid sequence of the CDR amino acid sequence of the variable region of a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 12 to 16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody according to a preferred, third embodiment of the present invention belongs to a group of humanized monoclonal antibodies which are not limited by a specific dissociation constant (Kd value) for 2B8, including humanized monoclonal antibodies which are effective against cells on which rituximab has no effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such antibodies include humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies combining the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 18 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 24, the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 18 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 22, the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 19 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 22, and the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 19 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse-derived monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention or mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies which can be used in the preparation of antibodies according to the present invention can be prepared, for example, by selecting a clone producing a monoclonal antibody having desired properties from hybridoma clones obtained by screening with the methods described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs sensitizing antigen (immunogen) are used, for example, SB or Raji cells which are CD20 expressing cells and CHO cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques, for example, using a commercially available DNA for CD20 (or fragments thereof having the same effect) (CHO/CD20), so as to express CD20 on the cell surface. The initial immunization, booster immunization(s), and the final immunization are administered such that the initial immunization and the booster immunization(s) are either carried out at least once using a cell strain which presents the sensitizing antigen and is derived from an animal belonging to a different order from the subject animal for immunization or carried out at least once using a cell strain which presents the sensitizing antigen on the surface of the cell membrane by genetic recombination and is derived from an animal belonging to the same order as the subject animal for immunization, and the final immunization is carried out using the other cell strain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther conditions may be similar to conditions used in methods for generating hybridomas producing usual monoclonal antibodies. Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies are generated by (1) immunization of animals to be immunized (2) preparation of lymphocytes from the immunized animals, (3) preparation of parent cells, (4) cell fusion of the lymphocytes and the parent cells, and (5) screening and cloning, according to known methods (see, for example, Monokuronaru kotai, Seikagaku Jikkenho [Monoclonal Antibody, Biochemical Experiment Methods], Ailsa M. Campbell (ed.), Toshiaki OSAWA (trans.), Tokyo Kagaku Dojin (1989)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for preparing monoclonal antibodies using cloned hybridomas can be similar to conventional methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies, except for employing hybridomas prepared using the method of hybridoma production according to the present invention. Large-scale production can be effected, for example, using methods by which the antibody is produced by cell culturing or as mouse ascites. Production of chimerized or humanized antibodies can be performed by preparing a gene coding for the chimerized or humanized antibody, inserting the gene into an expression vector, and expressing the expression vector in a suitable cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, genes for the L-chain variable region and the H-chain variable region can be chimerized using genes for the L-chain constant region and the H-chain (K) constant region of human immunoglobulin and inserted into a high expression vector for CHO cell. Although commercially available vector systems for the production of recombinant antibodies may be employed, it is possible to use vectors constructed in pNOW-ab, a dimer high-expression vector containing multicloning sites (MCSs) for both the L-chain and the H-chain, which is based on pNOW, a high expression vector for mammalian cells (Japanese Patent No. 3,582,965). Restriction maps showing the structure of these vectors are shown in \nFIG. 1\n and \nFIG. 2\n. CHO cells are transfected with an expression vector containing the chimerized antibody gene, and then highly-productive clones are selected. Antibodies are produced from these clones using usual methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies according to the first embodiment of the present invention display relative high binding affinities, as compared to rituximab, and high growth-inhibiting activities, preferably, due to apoptosis induction, and thus chimerized or humanized antibodies of these antibodies can be used as an active ingredient of therapeutic agents for malignant tumors of B-cells and diseases involving B-cells. Furthermore, antibodies according to the second and third embodiments of the present invention are thought to display complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against cells expressing human CD20 antigen, and thus can be used as an active ingredient of therapeutic agents for malignant tumors of B-cells and immune diseases involving B-cells. Therefore, the present invention also provides therapeutic agents for diseases involving B-cells which have as an active ingredient the chimerized or humanized antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, among the antibodies according to the present invention are antibodies that do not need an antibody requiring crosslinking with a secondary antibody in the induction of apoptosis, and these antibodies are suitable for pharmaceutical use, since antibodies capable of inducing apoptosis by themselves do not require any secondary antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, in the present invention, two or more types of antibodies according to the present invention can be combined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiseases involving B-cells include, but are not limited to, for example, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolyticanemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, Sjogren syndrome, Crohn's disease, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic agents can be produced by techniques known for pharmaceutical preparations. There is not particular limitation on other formulating ingredients. Dosages and the like can be determined by reference to known Rituxan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the present invention provides a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody combining the L-chain set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 27 to 30 and the H-chain set forth in any one of SEQ ID Nos: 31 to 34 (referred to herein as \nantibody\n 1782, antibody of the \nseries\n 1782, or the like). Of these antibodies, exemplified as preferable antibodies are humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in which the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 30 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 34 are combined (clone ff); the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 30 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 31 are combined (clone fv); and the L-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 29 and the H-chain set forth in SEQ ID No: 33 are combined (clone ss). These humanized antibodies, which are also derived from mouse, can be humanized as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nseries\n 1782 of humanized antibodies has weak activity for inducing apoptosis by themselves, but display, under crosslinking conditions, apoptosis inducing activity equal to or higher than that of Rituxan (c2B8). \nHumanized antibody\n 1782 displays CDC activity not only against RAJI, WIL2NS, and SU-DHL4 cells, but also against RC-K8 cells which are of a Rituxan-resistant strain. In particular, as detailed in the Examples, clones ff and fv of the \nseries\n 1782 have high CDC activities and display significantly greater CDC activities against SU-DHL4 cells than Rituxan. Putting together the results of Kd values and CDC activities, the clone ff of the \nseries\n 1782 is preferable in that it has the highest affinity, a relatively high CDC activity, and a CDC activity also against the strain RC-K8, a Rituxan-resistant strain. The clone fv of the \nseries\n 1782 is also preferable in that it has the highest CDC activity and in addition, is effective also on the strain RC-K8, a Rituxan-resistant strain. In particular, since the clone ff of the \nseries\n 1782 has a very high affinity, it is possible to RI label it to employ it for missile therapy of B-cell involving diseases. Furthermore, the clone fv of the \nseries\n 1782 is preferable in that it has a high CDC activity against SU-DHL4 cells, and the clone ss is preferable in that it has a high ADCC activity against RC-K8 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nseries\n 1782 of humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention can be also used as an active ingredient of therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant tumors of B-cells and immune diseases involving B-cells. Therefore, the present invention, in further embodiments, provides therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant tumors of B-cells and immune diseases involving B-cells, in which the therapeutic agents contain an antibody of the \nseries\n 1782 as an active ingredient. Methods by and amounts at which the therapeutic agents are administered can be easily determined by those skilled in the art. As diseases involving B-cells are exemplified the above-described diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the Examples. However, the invention is not limited to the Examples.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n(1) Preparation of Immunization Agents for Sensitizing Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nSB and Raji cells, which are of B-cell strains expressing CD20, were cultured in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparately, DNA coding for the entire CD20 molecule (Multiple Choice cDNA human spleen, Origene Technologies, Inc., 6 Taft Court, \nSuite\n 100, Rockville, Md. 20850) was cloned using specific primers hCD20-S-GK-Not: aatgcggccgccaccatgacaacacccagaaattc (SEQ ID No: 25) and hCD20-E-Xba: gctctagattaaggagagctgtcattttc (SEQ ID No: 26).\n\n\n \n \nThe DNA was inserted into a high expression vector for mammalian cells, pNOW, (\nFIG. 1\n) and a constructed vector was used to transform CHO cells. Recombinant CHO cells (CD20/CHO cells) displaying high levels of expression of CD20 on the cell surface were identified using FACS analysis. Staining was performed using an FITC-labeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and cells were selected as high expression cell, when they gave five or more times the fluorescence intensity of SB cells.\n\n\n \n(2) Preparation of Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \nSB or Raji cells were cultured using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. CD20/CHO cells were cultured using CHO-S-SFM II medium (Gibco, Cat. No. 12052-098) supplemented with 800 μg/ml of G418. These cultured mediums were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1,100 rpm, the cells were suspended in Dulbecco's PBS(−) and centrifuged again. This washing step was repeated once again, and physiological saline was added to the cells to prepare a suspension (cell number: 1-3×10\n7\n/ml), which was used for immunization.\n\n\n \n(3) Immunization\n\n\n \n \n \nThese immunogen preparations were administered intraperitoneally to female Balb/c mice of 7- to 11-week old. After administration of either of the SB or CD20/CHO cells was repeated two to three times at intervals of various days, the final immunization was carried out using cells of a different type (CD20/CHO or Raji cells). The number of cells administered was 1-3×10\n7 \ncells per mouse for each of these immunizations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of immunogens used are shown in Table 1.\n\n\n \n(4) Cell Fusion\n\n\n \n \n \nThree days after the final immunization, spleen cells were prepared from two mice and fused with mouse myeloma cells (NS−1) in the presence of PEG-1500 according to the method described in Oi, V. T. and L. A. Herzenberg, 1980, in: Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, eds.: B. Mishell and S. M. Shiigi (Freeman and Co., San Francisco, Calif.) p. 351.\n\n\n \n(5) Primary and Secondary Screening\n\n\n \n \n \nCell ELISA was performed using 96-well plates having CD20/CHO or CHO cells (parent strain) attached thereto to select wells where an antibody reacting specifically to CD20 was produced. 96-well plates with the same CD20/CHO cells attached thereto were subjected competitive reaction with rituximab (C2B8) to select antibodies (wells) which reacted to an epitope similar to that of C2B8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of these screenings are shown in Table 1.\n\n\n \n(6) Cell ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nCD20/CHO or CHO cells (parent strain) attached to a Poly-L-Lysine coated 96-well plate (Asahi Technoglass Corporation, Cat. No. 11-023-018) were used for Cell ELISA. 150 μl of blocking buffer (PBS solution with 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% BSA) was placed into each well and the plate was allowed to stand at 37° C. for one hour. The plate was washed five times using an aqueous solution of 150 nM NaCl, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20, and then a 100-μl sample (a diluted solution of a cultured supernatant) was placed into each well. The primary reaction was conducted at 37° C. for one hour. After washing, 100 μl of a diluted solution of a labeled antibody (HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (H+L) rabbit antibody (Jackson Lab., Code No. 315-035-003) or HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Fcγ) rabbit antibody (Jackson Lab., Code No. 315-035-008)) was placed into each well and a secondary reaction was conducted at 37° C. for one hour. The same blocking solution was used in the preparation of the reaction solution for the primary and the secondary reactions. After washing, 100 μl of a color developing solution (OPD) was placed into each well and 30 minutes later, 50 μl of 4N H\n2\nSO\n4 \nwas added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm.\n\n\n \n(7) Competitive Reaction in Cell ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nMixed solutions of a sample (diluted solution of a cultured supernatant) and a chimerized antibody (10 to 40 ng/ml) were prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter blocking reaction was carried out as in the above-described Cell ELISA, 100 μl of each of the mixed solutions was placed into each well and the primary reaction was performed at 37° C. for one hour. After washing, 100 μl of a diluted solution of a labeled antibody (HRP-labeled anti-human IgG (H+L) rabbit antibody (Jackson Lab., Code No. 309-035-082)) was placed into each well and a secondary reaction was conducted at 37° C. for one hour. After washing, 100 μl of a color developing solution (OPD) was placed into each well and 30 minutes later, 50 μl of 4N H\n2\nSO\n4 \nwas added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the labeled antibody reacts only with the chimerized antibody, any competition between the antibody in the sample added in the primary reaction and the chimerized antibody results in reduction in the measured value.\n\n\n \n(8) Cloning\n\n\n \n \n \nA limiting dilution method was used. After culturing cells seeded on 96-well plates, Cell ELISA was performed on cultured supernatants of wells having a single colony, thereby to select clones producing a specific antibody.\n\n\n \n(9) Preparation of Purified Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nClones producing a specific antibody were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. When the cell density reached approximately 5×10\n5 \ncells/ml, the medium was replaced by serum-free culture medium ASF-104N (Ajinomoto). Two to four days later, the cultured medium was centrifuged to collect the cultured supernatant. A protein G column was used for purification of the antibody. A solution of the eluted monoclonal antibody was dialyzed using 150 mM NaCl. The dialyzed solution was filter sterilized through a 0.2 μm filter to obtain an antibody sample to be tested (anti-human CD20 mouse monoclonal antibody).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n

determined. In addition, antibody binding affinities were measured and biological property tests were performed for the monoclonals produced by them, as described below.\n\n\n \n(1) Measurement of Binding Affinity\n\n\n \n \n \nFloating Raji cells derived from human B-cell, which express the target antigen on the cell surface, and floating Jurkat cells derived from human T-cell, which do not express CD20 antigen were used. Cells of both types were cultured in a CO\n2 \nincubator (SANYO MCO-175M) at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5% using RPMI 1640 medium (NACALAI TESQUE, Inc., Cat. No. 30264-85, Lot L4K2844) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (BIOLOGICAL IND., Cat. No. 04-001-1A, Lot 815242; preheated at 56° C. for 30 minutes inactivation of the complement components). The cells were maintained by subculturing twice a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements of the number of cells were made using a Burker-Turk hemacytometer (Erma, inc., Cat. No. 03-303-1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultured media of confluent cells three to four days after subculturing were centrifuged for three minutes at 3,000 rpm at room temperature using a multi-rack refrigerated centrifuge LX-120 (TONY Co., Ltd.). The supernatant was removed and the cells were collected. The rotation speed and time used in this step were selected so that the number of cells remained unchanged after the repetition of centrifugal separation and supernatant removing. For removing the culture medium and FCS remaining on the cell surface (washing), the collected cells were suspended in Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (−) (free of Ca and Mg, PBS(−), Wako, Cat. No. 191-01665, Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n: Wako, Cat. No. 197-02865, Lot ASF2635, KCl: Wako, Cat. No. 163-0334T, Lot CEQ7122, KH\n2\nPO\n4\n: Wako, Cat. No. 169-0425, Lot ELG7616)) and centrifuged twice for 3 minutes at 3,000 rpm to remove the supernatant. The cells after washing were suspended in a solution of 1% BSA (Wako, Cat. No. 013-07492 Lot PKH3483) in PBS and adjusted to a cell density of 5×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a primary antibody, an antibody to be tested or a positive control antibody (2B8) was dispensed into 1.5-ml tubes (BM Equipment Co., Ltd., BM ring-lock tubes, Cat. No. BM-15) in the respective amounts of 15, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 200 ng (1.5 to 5 μl). At the same time, four tubes with no added antibody were prepared. Three samples were prepared for each antibody to be tested. To each of the samples was added 100 μl (5×10\n5 \ncells) of a suspension in a PBS solution of 1% BSA (Wako, Cat. No. 013-07492, Lot PKH3483) and mixed, and reacted with shaking at room temperature for one hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter reacting, the reaction solutions were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 minutes at room temperature using a high-speed refrigerated microcentrifuge MX-100 (TONY). After collecting the cells, the cells were suspended in 200 μl of PBS and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for three minutes to remove the supernatant. These procedures were repeated twice to remove any unreacted primary antibody remaining on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (H&L) secondary antibody [GOAT Anti-mouse IgG (H&L) Fluorescein conjugated, affinity purified Secondary antibody, Chemicon, Cat. No. AP124F, Lot 24021014] was added in excess (500 ng) with respect to the primary antibody binding to cells, followed by 100 μl of a 1% BSA-PBS solution (500 ng/100 μl). The mixture was shaken for one hour at room temperature while being shielded from the light, and the primary antibody binding to cells was detected. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for three minutes to collect the cells. In order to remove any unreacted FITC-labeled anti mouse IgG (H&L) antibody remaining on the cell surface, the cells were suspended in 200 μl of PBS and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for three minutes to remove the supernatant. These procedures were repeated twice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells thus collected were suspended in 100 μl of PBS and transferred to flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd., ELISA PLATE, Cat. No. 8496F). The intensity of fluorescence from the secondary antibody was measured using a Typhoon 9210 Image Analyzer (Amersham Bioscience) under the following detection conditions: Fluorescence mode, 600 V, 526SP/green(532 nm), Focus: +3 mm above the bottom face. Controls for constructing a standard curve were prepared using PBS solutions of 100 μl, to which 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 ng of the FITC-labeled secondary antibody were added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the detection, images were digitized using an image analysis software, Image Quant (Amersham Bioscience), and analyzed using Excel (Microsoft). Background values resulting from the plate, PBS solution, and FITC-labeled secondary antibody binding non-specifically to cells were determined by measuring reactions only between the cells and the FITC-labeled secondary antibody, and the average value for the four points were subtracted from the value of fluorescence intensity for each sample. In this way, the amount of fluorescence from the FITC-labeled secondary antibody binding to cells was obtained. A standard curve was constructed by measuring amounts of fluorescence at various concentrations of the FITC-labeled secondary antibody used as control, and the amount of secondary antibody binding to cells (number of moles or weight) was calculated. The amount of primary antibody binding cells was calculated assuming that each of the primary antibodies and the FITC-labeled secondary antibody react at a ratio of 1:2. The amount of free primary antibody was determined by subtracting the binding amount from the added amount. When the antibody concentration was converted into molar concentration, the molecular weights of the monoclonal antibodies were taken to be 150,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that the binding reaction became saturated with increasing amounts of primary antibody added and the intensity of fluorescence reached a constant value. Scatchard analysis was used to calculate the number of antigens on the cell surface and the dissociation constant (Kd value) (see Scatchard, G., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 51: 660-672, 1949; New Cultured Cell Experimental Methods in Molecular Biology Research, Yodosha Co., Ltd., Jikken Igaku separate volume, BioManual UP Series Revised 2\nnd \nEdition, pages 212 to 217). The values used were the average of three values for the respective samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe measurement results for monoclonal antibodies produced by 8 representative clones and a positive control antibody (2B8) are shown below in Table 3.\n\n\n \n(2) Biological Property Tests\n\n\n(a) Apoptosis Induction Test\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of test antibodies to induce apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry (Annexin V/PI staining). A positive control (2B8) and a negative control (Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen) were used. The test was performed using a MEBCYTO Apoptosis Kit (MBL, Cat. No. 4700, Lot. 20).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRaji cells were centrifuged, and suspended in fresh RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, Cat. No. R8758, Lot. 44K2416) supplemented with 10% (inactivated) FBS (ICN, Cat. No. 2916754, Lot. 8005C) and placed into each well of 12-well plates in a volume of 1 ml at a density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/ml. Twelve wells per antibody were used for testing, and an antibody was added to the respective wells to give a final concentration of 2 or 4 μg/ml (3 wells×2 concentrations×2 time points, 12 wells in total). On \n \ndays\n \n 1 and 2 after the culture was started, the cultured media containing about 2×10\n5 \ncells were removed and after centrifugation, the cells were washed once in PBS. Then, the cells were suspended in 85 μl of binding buffer. After mixing well with 10 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of PI, the mixture was allowed to react for 15 minutes at room temperature while being shielded from the light. Measurements were made using flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with CellQuest (Becton Dickinson).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe measurement results for monoclonal antibodies produced by 6 representative clones, a positive control antibody (2B8), and a negative control antibody (Anti-CD3) are shown below in \nFIG. 3\n \na \nto \nFIG. 3\n \nd\n. Although 2B8 is in general believed to have a high ability to induce apoptosis, the monoclonal antibodies produced by the clone 1k1791 obtained from cell fusion of the series 1K17 (immunization with CD20/CHO cells and Raji cells) and by the clone 1k1422 obtained from cell fusion of the series 1K14 (immunization with SB cells and CD20/CHO cells) were found to display high abilities to induce apoptosis when compared with 2B8.\n\n\n \n(b) Cell Growth Inhibition Test\n\n\n \n \n \nA suspension of Raji cells with a \ncell concentration\n 5×10\n4 \ncells/ml was prepared in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, added at a volume of 100 μl per well into 96-well plates, and cultured. After 24 hours, an antibody solution was added at a volume of 50 μl per well to give an antibody concentration of 1 μl/ml, and culturing was continued. At 72 hours after addition of the antibody, 10 μl/well of a color developing dye, Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Cat. No. 343-07623, Lot. SG076), was added, culturing was continued for another 4 hours, and then absorption was measured at 492 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe absorbance measurement results for monoclonal antibodies from the six clones as described above, a positive control antibody (2B8), and a negative control are shown below in Table 2, and their properties are shown in Table 3.\n\n\n \nCell Growth Inhibition Test\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClone name\n\n\nAbsorption (492 nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1K1422\n\n\n1.775\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1K1791\n\n\n1.794\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1K1712\n\n\n2.326\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1K1402\n\n\n2.540\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1K1736\n\n\n2.239\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1K1782\n\n\n2.603\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPositive control (2B8)\n\n\n1.759\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNegative control\n\n\n2.607\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nProperties of Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBinding\n\n\n \n\n\nCell Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\naffinity\n\n\nAbility\n\n\nInhibiting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKd value\n\n\nto Induce\n\n\nEffect (in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone name\n\n\nIsotype\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nApoptosis\n\n\nVitro)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1422\n\n\nIgG1, κ\n\n\n3.39\n\n\n130\n\n\npresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1791\n\n\nIgG1, κ\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n160\n\n\npresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K0924\n\n\nIgG2b, κ\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n60\n\n\npresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1712\n\n\nIgG2a, κ\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n50\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1402\n\n\nIgG1, κ\n\n\n0.78\n\n\n30\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1736\n\n\nIgG2b, κ\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n50\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1782\n\n\nIgG1, κ\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n30\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1K1228\n\n\nIgG1, κ\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n30\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive control (2B8)\n\n\nIgG1, κ\n\n\n6.79\n\n\n100\n\n\npresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(c) Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this series of experiments, measurements were made of whether effector cells could become activated through the Fc region of an anti-CD20 chimerized antibody, thereby to lyse cells of lymphoma cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour types of cells, Raji, WiL2-NS, SU-DHL4, and RC-K8 cells derived from human B-cell, were cultured and maintained in an incubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5% in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated FCS (culture medium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn these experiments, cells of each type were washed in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and reacted with calcein for 15 minutes at 37° C., whereby the calcein was allowed to be incorporated into viable cells, and after that, the number of cells was adjusted to 4×10\n5 \ncells/ml. Since calcein is retained only in cells having the cell membrane kept in normal conditions, it can be used to stain only viable cells. Rituximab (C2B8), which is an anti-CD20 chimerized antibody, and 6 types of chimerized antibodies (1k0924, 1k1402, 1k1422, 1k1712, 1k1736, and 1k1791) were adjusted to be at 20, 4, and 0.8 μg/ml using RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. Effector cells were adjusted to be at 5×10\n6\n, 1×10\n6\n, and 0.2×10\n6 \ncells/ml after effector cells were obtained by taking blood from healthy subjects and immediately layering the blood onto a Ficoll, followed by centrifugation to collect a lymphocyte fraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a total of 100 μl, 25 μl of a cell suspension having an adjusted concentration, 25 μl of each of the anti-CD20 chimerized antibody solutions (with the respective final concentrations of 5, 1, and 0.2 μg/ml), and 50 μl of effector cell for each of the antibody concentrations (with the respective E:T ratios of 25:1, 5:1 and 1:1) were mixed well in 96-well plates and reacted for 4 hours in an incubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5%. Three samples were prepared as follows: a first sample in which the antibody solution and the effector cells were replaced with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, in order to calculate the spontaneous lysis of cells; a second sample in which the antibody solution was replaced with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, which was for calculating the antibody-independent activity of only the effector cells; and a third sample in which the antibody solution was replaced with 20% Triton X-100, which was for calculating the maximum lysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, if cells have been lyzed, then the cell membrane has been broken and the calcein has been released out of the cell. Based on this, the fluorescence of calcein released into the reaction solution was quenched using a Quencher and the amount of fluorescence was then measured using a fluorescence analyzer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the detection, images were digitized using an image analysis software (Amersham Bioscience), and the lysis rate for each sample was calculated using the equation below.\n\n\n \n \n \nLysis rate(%)=((Spontaneous lysis)−(Sample))/((Spontaneous lysis)−(Maximum lysis))×100  \nEquation\n 1\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n \na \nto \nFIG. 4\n \nd \nshow the relationship between antibody concentration and cytotoxic activity for each of the cell types, when the ratio of the number of effector cells, such as NK cells, and the number of target cells (E:T ratio) was 25:1. \nFIG. 5\n \na \nto \nFIG. 5\n \nd \nshow the relationship between the E:T ratio and cytotoxic activity for each of the cell types, when the antibody concentration was 5 μg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 4\n \na \nto \nFIG. 4\n \nd\n, all of the cell types shows cytotoxic activity by adding the respective antibodies, under conditions where the E:T ratio was 25:1. In other words, the antibodies participate in cytotoxicity. Furthermore, cell strains other than WiL2-NS display, already at an antibody concentration of 0.2 μg/ml, activities equivalent to those at antibody concentrations of 1 and 5 μg/ml (which become saturated at 0.2 μg/ml) and the activity becomes constant after reaching a maximum, suggesting that these effects are provided in amounts of antibody which are less than the amount of antibody required for complement-dependent cytotoxic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 5\n \na \nto \nFIG. 5\n \nd\n, it would be recognized that from the effect of E:T ratio on cytotoxic activity at an antibody concentration of 5 μg/ml, the cytotoxic activity increases depending on the E:T ratio concentration. From this, it can be concluded that the cytotoxicity is caused by the action of effector cells.\n\n\n \n(d) Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this series of experiments, measurements were made of whether the anti-CD20 chimerized antibodies could lyse cells of lymphoma cell lines in the presence of serum containing complements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour types of cells, Raji, WiL2-NS, SU-DHL4, and RC-K8 cells derived from human B-cell, were cultured and maintained in an incubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5% in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated FCS (culture medium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn these experiments, cells of each type were washed in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and the number of cells was adjusted to 2-3×10\n6 \ncells/ml. C2B8 (rituximab), which is an anti-CD20 chimerized antibody, and 6 types of chimerized antibodies (1k0924, 1k1402, 1k1422, 1k1712, 1k1736, and 1k1791) were adjusted to be at 20, 4, and 0.8 μg/ml using RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a total of 100 μl, 55 μl of a cell suspension having an adjusted concentration, 25 μl of each of the anti-CD20 chimerized antibody solutions (with the respective final concentrations of 5, 1, and 0.2 μg/ml), and 20 μl of pooled serum taken from five healthy subjects or an inactivated serum thereof were mixed well using a vortex mixer and reacted for 2 hours in an incubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5%. Samples in which 25 μl of the antibody solution was replaced with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS were prepared as samples for calculation of backgrounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, dead cells were stained using PI (propidium iodide) and analyzed by FACS (Becton Dickinson). As numerical values, populations obtained of dead cells were directly used, from which the values of background and of the sample to which the inactivated serum was added were subtracted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n \na \nto \nFIG. 6\n \nd \nshow the relationship between antibody concentration and cytotoxic activity for each cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 6\n \na \nto \nFIG. 6\n \nd\n, all the six types of antibodies show activity in Raji, WiL2-NS, and SU-DHL4. Furthermore, the concentration dependency can be confirmed, and when compared at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, 1k1791 shows particularly high activities relative to the other antibodies, followed by 1k1736, 1k1422, and 1k1712 showing high activities. At this concentration, it can be recognized that in Raji and WiL2-NS cells, 1k1791 induces cytotoxicity at levels approaching about two times those induced by the other antibodies, which also display activities equal to or greater than rituximab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRC-K8 cells on which rituximab is considered to have no effect, on the other hand, were found to remarkably show differences between the respective antibodies. Rituximab, 1k1402, and 1k1712 show little or no activity against RC-K8 cells. In contrast, 1k1791 displays very high activity and shows a cytotoxic activity of approximately 50% at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Subsequently to 1k1791, 1k0924 shows a cytotoxic activity of 25% or so, and 1k1422 and 1k1736 show a cytotoxic activity of 10% or so.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the above, it can be confirmed that the 6 types of chimerized antibodies which were used as the subject of these tests display CDC activities equal to or stronger than rituximab.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\n(1) Measurement of Binding Affinity\n\n\n \n \n \nRaji cells derived from human B-cell were cultured in a CO\n2 \nincubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5% using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated FCS. The cells were maintained by subculturing twice a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell cultures three to four days after subculturing (containing approximately 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml) were centrifuged for five minutes at 1,000 rpm at room temperature to collect the cells. The cells were suspended in PBS(−) and centrifuged for five minutes at 1,000 rpm to remove the supernatant. These procedures were repeated twice for washing the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction with a primary antibody was performed by mixing the respective anti-CD20 antibodies (mouse antibody 2B8 as positive control antibody, chimerized antibodies, and humanized antibody C2B8) with Raji cells and subjecting the mixtures to reaction at room temperature for one hour. In the reaction, the respective anti-CD20 antibodies had twelve final concentrations of 1.33, 2.67, 4.00, 5.33, 6.67, 8.00, 9.33, 10.67, 12.00, 13.33, 14.67, and 16.00 nM, the number of cells was 5×10\n6 \ncells, and the reaction solution used a 1% BSA/PBS solution, which was dispensed into 1.5-ml tubes to a final volume of 100 μl. Three samples for each antibody to be tested were prepared, and as samples for calculation of backgrounds, four tubes to which no antibody was added were also prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at room temperature for three minutes at 3,000 rpm to remove any unreacted primary antibody and to collect the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of an FITC-labeled secondary antibody prepared at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in a 1% BSA/PBS solution was added at a volume of 100 μl into the tubes, so that the FITC-labeled secondary antibody was in excess with respect to the primary antibody binding to cells, and the mixture, after suspending, was reacted for one hour at room temperature while being shielded from the light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FITC-labeled secondary antibodies used were GOAT Anti Mouse IgG (H&L)-FITC for the mouse antibody, and GOAT F(ab′) 2F fragment [sic] Anti Human IgG (Fcγ)-FITC for the chimerized and humanized antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, the mixtures were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for three minutes at room temperature. Unreacted FITC-labeled secondary antibody was removed and the cells were collected. The cells were washed by suspending them in 200 μl of PBS and centrifuging them again.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were suspended in 100 μl of PBS and transferred into flat-bottomed 96-well plates. The intensity of fluorescence of the secondary antibody was measured using a Typhoon 9210 Image Analyzer (Amersham Bioscience).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the detection, images were digitized using an image analysis software, Image Quant (Amersham Bioscience) and analyzed using Excel (Microsoft). The average value for the same tested antibody was calculated and the average value obtained from the samples for background calculation (in which only the cells and the FITC-labeled secondary antibody were reacted) was subtracted from the value for each of the tested antibodies, thereby to eliminate the background value resulting from the plate, PBS solution, and FITC-labeled secondary antibody binding non-specifically to cells. Additionally, a standard curve was constructed by measuring amounts of the fluorescence from solutions containing only the FITC-labeled secondary antibody in amounts of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 ng per 100 μl. This standard curve was used to determine the number of moles of the secondary antibody binding to cells. Assuming that each of the primary antibodies and the FITC-labeled secondary antibody react at a ratio of 1:5, the amount of primary antibody binding to cells was calculated. The amount of free primary antibody was calculated by subtracting the binding amount from the added amount. These values were used for Scatchard analysis, thereby to calculate the dissociation constant Kd.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown below in Table 4.\n\n\n \n(2) Apoptosis Induction Test\n\n\n \n \n \nInitial apoptosis was detected using a Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit under two reaction conditions, a first condition where measurements were made of apoptosis which an anti-CD20 antibody alone induced against cells derived from human B-cell stains (non-crosslinking condition), and a second condition where measurements were made of apoptosis which was induced by adding a secondary antibody recognizing the Fc region of an anti-CD20 antibody (crosslinking condition).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour types of cells, Raji, WIL2-NS, SU-DHL4, and RC-K8 cells derived from human B-cell, were cultured in a CO\n2 \nincubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5% in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated FCS (culture medium). The cells were maintained by subculturing twice a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree to four days after subculturing, cell cultures (approximately 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml) were centrifuged for five minutes at 1,000 rpm at room temperature to collect the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe respective anti-CD20 antibodies (mouse antibody 2B8 as positive control antibody, chimerized antibodies, and humanized antibody C2B8; Anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody as negative control) were mixed with the cells suspended in fresh culture medium and the mixtures were reacted for 1.5 hours in an incubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5%. In the reaction, the respective anti-CD20 antibodies had three final concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5 μg/ml, the cell density was 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml, and the reaction solution used culture medium, which was placed in a volume of 250 μl into 1.5-ml tubes and subjected to reaction. Three samples were prepared for each antibody to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, the mixtures were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for three minutes at room temperature to remove unreacted antibody and to collect the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder the non-crosslinking condition, 250 μl of fresh culture medium was added to the cells. Under the crosslinking condition, 250 μl of a secondary antibody recognizing the Fc region of the anti-CD20 antibody, which was in an amount of five times the amount of the CD20 antibody, was added to the cells. After mixing, the mixtures were reacted for another three hours in an incubator at 37° C. and at a CO\n2 \nconcentration of 5%. The secondary antibodies used were Goat Anti mouse IgG, Fcγ Fragment for the mouse antibody, and Goat Anti human IgG, Fcγ Fragment specific, for the chimerized and humanized antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, the mixtures were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for three minutes at room temperature to remove unreacted secondary antibody and to collect the cells. The cells were washed by suspending them in 250 μl of PBS and centrifuging them again.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reagent for detection used a MEBCYTO apoptosis kit-Annexin V-FITC, PI- (MBL, Cat. No. 4700, Lot. 21). After the cells were suspended in 85 μl of Binding buffer, μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of propidium iodide (PI) (a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) were added and mixed well, and the mixture was reacted for 15 minutes at room temperature while being shielded from the light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n20,000 cells in a total count were measured using flow cytometry (EPICS ALTRA: BECKMAN COULTER) and analyzed (Expo32: BECKMAN COULTER).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFIG. 7\n \na \nto \nFIG. 9\n \nd. \n \n\n\n \n(3) Preparation of Humanized Antibody Producing Strains\n\n\n(a) DNA Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nDNAs with codons optimized for CHO cells, based on the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 17 to 24, were designed and synthesized in routine procedures.\n\n\n \n(b) Preparation of Constructs\n\n\n \n \n \nSixteen types of expression constructs for humanized 1K1791 were constructed using pNOW as an expression vector.

The cells were maintained by subculturing twice a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell culture about two weeks after subculturing was started was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for five minutes at room temperature to collect the supernatant, which in turn was filtered using a 0.45-μm syringe filter and equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe supernatant was loaded onto a Hi Trap Protein A HP column (GE Healthcare, Cat No. 17-0402-01), and then washed using 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Elutions were obtained using 0.1 M citric acid, pH 4.0. Fractions of 400 μl were collected and neutralized with 40 μl, corresponding to 10/1 [sic] of the fraction volume, of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.0. Dialysis was performed against PBS of 100-times volume using Slyde-A Lyzer 10K Dialysis Cassetes (PIERCE, Cat.

The inventors were able to divide the 8 types of mouse antibodies and known CD20 antibodies, 2B8 and 2H7, into two groups with respect to all the four types of cells (some exceptions were not included).\n\n\n \n \nGroup A: m0924, m1422, m1791, m2B8\n\n\nGroup B: m1228, m1402 m1712, m1782, m2H7\n\n\n(However, m0924 was included in Group B with respect to SU-DHL4 cells).\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other words, Group A includes anti-CD20 antibodies which display sufficient capabilities to induce apoptosis by themselves and have approximately the same level of apoptosis inducing capability even under the crosslinking condition with a secondary antibody, while Group B includes anti-CD20 antibodies which display insufficient capabilities to induce apoptosis by themselves and have an greatly increased capabilities to induce apoptosis under the crosslinking condition. Furthermore, the antibodies belonging to Group A display affinities comparable to that of 2B8, while the antibodies belonging to Group B display higher affinities than that of 2B8. Consequently, it can be inferred that the antibodies of Group A are more suitable for pharmaceutical use since they do not require the presence of a secondary antibody to induce apoptosis and are capable of inducing apoptosis by themselves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTurning to the type of cells, the results indicate that RAJI, WIL2-NS, RCK8 cells had ratios of apoptosis, at highest, in the range of 30 to 40%, whereas SU-DHL4 cells displayed maximum ratios of not less than 80% in some cases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results for the four types of humanized antibodies are shown in \nFIG. 8\n \na \nto \nFIG. 9\n \nd. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly to the mouse antibodies, four clones of humanized antibody 1791 were classified into two groups with respect to all the four types of cells.\n\n\n \n \nGroup A: fv10, ff34\n\n\nGroup B: sf43, ss32, c2B8\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies fv10 and ff34 of Group A, which display comparable affinities to that of C2B8, have almost the same apoptosis activity as that of C2B8 under the non-crosslinking condition and clearly increased activities under the crosslinking condition. Although antibodies sf and ss of Group B display greater dissociation constants and weaker affinities than the antibodies of Group A, these antibodies alone display slightly stronger apoptosis activities than C2B8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs concerns the capability of the anti-CD20 antibodies to induce apoptosis against B-cells, when they display sufficient capabilities of inducing apoptosis by themselves, the ratio of apoptosis is substantially the same under the crosslinking condition. However, when they do not display a sufficient capability of inducing apoptosis by themselves, due to the type of antibodies, unsaturated conditions, or the like, it is likely that apoptosis activity will increase under the crosslinking condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n \na \nto \nFIG. 9\n \nd \nare graphs showing early apoptosis (%) wherein the ratio of early apoptosis under conditions of “no Ab” (no added antibody) on the day of the experiments is set to 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApoptosis activities of four clones of humanized antibody 1791, clones fv, ff, sf, and ss, against Raji, SU-DHL4, WiL-2, and RCK8 cells are summarized in Table 6.\n\n\n \nSummary of Apoptosis Activities of Humanized Antibody-1791 Clones\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity\n\n\nApoptosis (5 ug/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(average)\n\n\nRAJI\n\n\nWil2-NS\n\n\nDHL4\n\n\nRCK8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRaji\n\n\n \n\n\nXL\n\n\n \n\n\nXL\n\n\n \n\n\nXL\n\n\n \n\n\nXL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\nm2B8 = 100\n\n\nw/wo\n\n\nm2B8 = 100\n\n\nw/wo\n\n\nm2B8 = 100\n\n\nw/wo\n\n\nm2B8 = 100\n\n\nw/wo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc2B8\n\n\n5.35\n\n\n100\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n100\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n100\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n100\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfv\n\n\n7.21\n\n\n88\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n49\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n65\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n50\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nff\n\n\n8.15\n\n\n84\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n49\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n96\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n47\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsf\n\n\n12.70\n\n\n205\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n100\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n143\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n93\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nss\n\n\n23.09\n\n\n202\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n108\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n133\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n92\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno Ab\n\n\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n41\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n26\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n37\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDC activities were measured for the clones fv, ff, sf, and ss, of humanized antibody 1791 using Raji, SU-DHL4, WiL-2, and RCK8 cells.

Field of the Invention (Technical Field)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to linear or cyclic constructs or compounds which include a plurality of amino acid residues and one or more ring-constrained amino acid surrogates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Background Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino Acid Surrogates. A number of different peptide mimetics are known, and are employed to make mimetics of critical function domains of peptides. See generally \nBioorganic Chemistry: Peptides and Proteins \nS. M. Hecht, ed., Oxford University Press, 1998, and particularly Chapter 12 thereof, pages 395-419, and the references cited therein. Peptides and proteins are highly flexible, due in large part to the high rotational degrees of freedom of individual amino acid residues. In addition, some bonds in side chains of individual amino acid residues also have rotational degrees of freedom. The non-bonded steric interactions between amino acid residues force the peptide or protein along its degrees of freedom into some stable minimal free energy configuration. Local structures, also known as a “secondary structure,” are common in peptides and proteins. These structures include α-helixes, β-bends, sheets, extended chains, loops and the like, and most often contribute to binding or receptor-specificity of peptides and proteins. There are several types of α-helixes known, differing in torsion angles within the amino acid residues of the actual turn and by the patterns of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding. There are also a number of known different β-bends, differing in the dihedral torsion angles ψ (for the C\na\n—C bond) or I) (for the C\na\n—N bond), or both. Peptide mimetics are employed to provide a conformationally restricted component in a molecule, in part with the objective of fixing critical function domains in a restricted configuration that is optimal for a desired biological response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically peptide mimetics are designed and intended to fix and mimic the function of a dipeptide or tripeptide. For example, see the reverse-turn mimetics disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,008,941, 6,943,157, 6,413,963, 6,184,223, 6,013,458 and 5,929,237, and U.S. Published Patent Application 2006/0084655, all describing various bicyclic ring structures asserted to mimic a dipeptide or tripeptide sequence. Other applications disclose a number of different small molecule compounds, again asserted to mimic a dipeptide or tripeptide sequence. See, for example, U.S. Published Patent Applications 2006/0234923 and 2003/0191049.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatriuretic Peptide System. One potential application for amino acid surrogates employs the natriuretic peptide system, which has been extensively explored since the identification of the human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) sequence and gene structure in 1984. ANP is part of the natriuretic peptide system, which in humans involves an ANP gene, which through differences in post-translational processing results in both ANP and urodilatin, a gene which produces BNP, or brain natriuretic peptide, and a gene which produces CNP, or c-type natriuretic peptide. ANP, urodilatin, BNP and CNP are each ring structures, with a 17 amino acid loop formed by a cysteine-cysteine disulfide linkage. ANP, urodilatin, BNP and CNP are closely related, differing by some five or six amino acids within the ring, though the N- and C-terminal tails are substantially different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are three know human natriuretic peptide receptors, natriuretic peptide receptors A, B and C(NPRA, NPRB and NPRC). NPRA and NPRB are linked to guanylyl cyclases, while NPRC is a G-protein linked clearance receptor. ANP, BNP and CNP are the primary endogenous mammalian natriuretic peptides identified to date. However, there are a number of non-mammalian natriuretic peptides that have been identified and may have therapeutic application in mammals. These include salmon natriuretic or cardiac peptide (sCP), ventricular natriuretic peptide (VNP), a cardiac natriuretic peptide identified in eels and a variety of fish, dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), a natriuretic peptide identified in mamba snake venom, and three natriuretic-like peptides (TNP-a, TNP-b, and TNP-c) isolated from taipan snake venom.

Once released, ANP is a hormonal regulator of blood pressure, sodium and fluid homeostasis, providing vasorelaxant effects, affecting cardiovascular remodeling, and the like. Thus ANP, including endogenous ANP, is effective in congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular disease, in part by providing a defense against a chronically activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Circulating ANP is rapidly removed from the circulation by two mechanisms, binding to a natriuretic peptide receptor and enzymatic degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman ANP is also referred to as wild-type human ANP, hANP, ANP(1-28) and ANP(99-126) (the later referring to the relevant sequence within proANP(1-126), which is normally cleaved at Arg\n98\n-Ser\n99 \nin the C-terminal region during secretion). Hereafter human ANP is sometimes referred to as “hANP.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, natriuretic peptides and variants thereof are believed to have utility in the treatment of congestive heart failure, renal hypertension, acute kidney failure and related conditions, as well as any condition, disease or syndrome for which a diuretic, natriuretic and/or vasodilatory response would have a therapeutic or preventative effect. One review article describing natriuretic peptides, including ANP, and use of the natriuretic peptide system in heart failure is Schmitt M., Cockcroft J. R., and Frenneaux M. P. Modulation of the natriuretic peptide system in heart failure: from bench to bedside? \nClinical Science \n105:141-160 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large number of ANP mimetics and variations have been made, some of which are substantially reduced in size from ANP. On ANP version that is reduced in size yet is biologically active is the 15-mer disulfide cyclic peptide H-Met-cyclo(Cys-His-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Met-Asp-Arg-Ile-Ser-Cys)-Tyr-Arg-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:1) as described in Li B, Tom J Y, Oare D, Yen R, Fairbrother W J, Wells J A, Cunningham B C. Minimization of a polypeptide hormone. \nScience \n270:1657-60 (1995). This 15-mer peptide is commonly referred to as “mini-ANP”.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a ring-constrained amino acid surrogate of the general formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor an enantiomer, stereoisomer or diastereoisomer thereof, or a synthetically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkyl-N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, alkyl-OR\n8\n, alkyl-C(═O)OR\n8\n, C(═O)OR\n8\n, alkyl-NH\n2\n, alkyl-S—R\n8\n, alkyl-C(═O)N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, or a group of a formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis H or alkyl, provided that R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare not both H;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3 \nis H or a first nitrogen protecting group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n4 \nis H, alkyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OH, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(H)R\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OR\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOH, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOBn, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOallyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)(CH\n2\n)\np\nN(R\n8\n)\n2\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n5 \nis H or alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n6a \nis H, alkyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OH, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(H)R\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OR\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOH, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOBn, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOallyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)(CH\n2\n)\np\nN(R\n8\n)\n2\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n6b \nis H or alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nprovided that both of R\n4 \nand R\n6a \nare not (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OH, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(H)R\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OR\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOH, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOBn, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOallyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)(CH\n2\n)\np\nN(R\n8\n)\n2\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n7 \nis H, C(═O)alkyl, C(═O)(CH\n2\n)\nm\n(NR\n8\n)\n2\n, alkyl, aralkyl, or aryl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach occurrence of R\n8 \nis independently H, aryl, or alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n11 \nis a peptide solid support;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n12 \nis H or a second nitrogen protecting group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach occurrence of m is an independent integer having a value between 0 and 6;\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach occurrence of q is an independent integer having a value between 1 and 6;\n\n\n \n \n \n \np is an integer having a value between 1 and 10; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \ny is 0 or 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the surrogate of general formula I, y is 1.

Thus, according to this definition, the chemical formula “A” below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R′ is a group of the formula “B”,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nrepresents the compound below\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Composition”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “composition”, as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“EC\n50\n”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “EC\n50\n” is intended to include the molar concentration of an agonist which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cGMP assay, has an EC\n50 \nof 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50 \ndetermination is in nanomoles (nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Ki (nM)”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Ki (nM)” is intended to include the equilibrium receptor binding affinity representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of a competitor. In general, the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099-3108, 1973):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nligand\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere “ligand” is the concentration of ligand, which may be a radioligand, and K\nd \nis an inverse measure of receptor affinity which produces 50% receptor occupancy. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Peptide”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “peptide” as used throughout the specification and claims is intended to include any structure comprised of two or more amino acids, including chemical modifications and derivatives of amino acids. The amino acids forming all or a part of a peptide may be naturally occurring amino acids, stereoisomers and modifications of such amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically modified amino acids, and the like. The term “peptide” also includes dimers or multimers of peptides. A “manufactured” peptide includes a peptide produced by chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, combinations of the foregoing or, in general, made by any other method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Amino Acid Side Chain Moiety”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “amino acid side chain moiety” used in this invention, including as used in the specification and claims, includes any side chain of any amino acid, as the term “amino acid” is defined herein. This thus includes the side chain moiety present in naturally occurring amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in modified naturally occurring amino acids, such as glycosylated amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. For example, the side chain moiety of any amino acid disclosed herein is included within the definition. A “derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety” as hereafter defined is included within the definition of an amino acid side chain moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Derivative of an Amino Acid Side Chain Moiety”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety” is a modification to or variation in any amino acid side chain moiety, including a modification to or variation in either a naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid side chain moiety, wherein the modification or variation includes: (a) adding one or more saturated or unsaturated carbon atoms to an existing alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl chain; (b) substituting a carbon in the side chain with another atom, preferably oxygen or nitrogen; (c) adding a terminal group to a carbon atom of the side chain, including methyl (—CH\n3\n), methoxy (—OCH\n3\n), nitro (—NO\n2\n), hydroxyl (—OH), or cyano (—C≡N); (d) for side chain moieties including a hydroxy, thio or amino groups, adding a suitable hydroxy, thio or amino protecting group; or (e) for side chain moieties including a ring structure, adding one or ring substituents, including hydroxyl, halogen, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage. For amino groups, suitable amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, Z, Fmoc, Boc, Pbf, Pmc and the like.\n\n\n \n“Amino Acids”\n\n\n \n \n \nThe “amino acids” used in embodiments of the present invention, and the term as used in the specification and claims, include the known naturally occurring protein amino acids, which are referred to by both their common three letter abbreviation and single letter abbreviation. See generally \nSynthetic Peptides: A User's Guide\n, G. A. Grant, editor, W.H. Freeman & Co., New York (1992), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the text and table set forth at pages 11 through 24. An “amino acid” includes conventional α-amino acids and further includes both β-amino acids and α, α-disubstituted amino acids wherein at least one side chain is an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. An “amino acid” further includes N-alkyl α-amino acids, wherein the N-terminus amino group has a C\n1 \nto C\n6 \nlinear or branched alkyl substituent. It may thus be seen that the term “amino acid” includes stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. Modified and unusual amino acids are described generally in \nSynthetic Peptides: A User's Guide\n, cited above; Hruby V. J., Al-obeidi F., Kazmierski W., \nBiochem.

Thus, “Nle” is norleucine; “Asp” is aspartic acid; His is histidine; “Arg” is arginine; “Trp” is tryptophan; “Lys” is lysine; “Gly” is glycine; “Pro” is proline; “Tyr” is tyrosine, “Ser” is serine and so on. All residues are in the L-isomer configuration unless the D-isomer is specified, as in “D-Ala” for D-alanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single amino acid, including stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid wherein at least one side chain is the same as that of the residue from which it is derived), a β-amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e., a β-amino acid which other than for the presence of a β-carbon is otherwise the same as the residue from which it is derived) and the like, including all of the foregoing, is sometimes referred to herein as a “residue.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“α,α-disubstituted amino acid”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “α,α-disubstituted amino acid” includes any α-amino acid having a further substituent in the α-position, which substituent may be the same as or different from the side chain moiety of the α-amino acid. Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the α-amino acid, include C\n1 \nto C\n6 \nlinear or branched alkyl. Aib is an example of an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. While α,α-disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the α-position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D-isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)-2-Amino-2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-Nle or as an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-Ala. Similarly, Aib can be referred to as an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from Ala. Whenever an α,α-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“N-Substituted Amino Acid”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “N-substituted amino acid” includes any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the α-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid. By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“C-Terminus Capping Group”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “C-terminus capping group” includes any terminal group attached through the terminal ring carbon atom or, if provided, terminal carboxyl group, of the C-terminus of a compound. The terminal ring carbon atom or, if provided, terminal carboxyl group, may form a part of a residue, or may form a part of an amino acid surrogate. In a preferred aspect, the C-terminus capping group forms a part of an amino acid surrogate which is at the C-terminus position of the compound. The C-terminus capping group includes, but is not limited to, —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—OH, —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—OH, —(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—OH, —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n), —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n), —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—CH\n3\n, —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—CH\n3\n, —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n), —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—N—((CH\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n))\n2\n, —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—CH(—C(═O)—OH)—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n), —C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—NH—C(═O)—CH(N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n))((C H\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n)), or —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—CH(—C(═O)—NH\n2\n)—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n), including all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing, where v\n1 \nand v\n2 \nare each independently H, a C\n1 \nto C\n17 \nlinear or branched alkyl chain, m is 0 to 17 and n is 0 to 2; or any omega amino aliphatic, terminal aryl or aralkyl, including groups such as methyl, dimethyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, allyl, cyclopropane methyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyl, acetyl, propionoyl, butanoyl, phenylacetyl, cyclohexylacetyl, naphthylacetyl, cinnamoyl, phenyl, benzyl, benzoyl, 12-Ado, 7′-amino heptanoyl, 6-Ahx, Amc or 8-Aoc, or any single natural or unnatural α-amino acid, β-amino acid or α,α-disubstituted amino acid, including all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing, optionally in combination with any of the foregoing non-amino acid capping groups. In the foregoing, it is to be understood that, for example, —C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n—NH—C(═O)—CH(N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n))((CH\n2\n)\nm\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n)) is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“N-Terminus Capping Group”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “N-terminus capping group” includes any terminal group attached through the terminal amine of the N-terminus of a compound.

In particular, certain compound names were derived from the structures using the Autonom program as utilized by Chemdraw Ultra or ISIS base (MDL Corp.). In general, structure diagrams do not depict hydrogen atoms associated with carbon atoms other than in terminal groups and other special circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds are depicted herein with the surrogates identified by structure diagrams and the amino acid residues identified by a three letter abbreviation. Unless otherwise specified, it is understood that the bond between the surrogate and residue, or between the residue and surrogate, or between a surrogate and residues on both the N-terminus and C-terminus side thereof, is a conventional peptide bond, —C(═O)—NH— or, in the case where the peptide bond is to the ring nitrogen on the N-terminus of the surrogate, —C(═O)—N—. In general, in the depiction of such bonds the atoms of the amino acid surrogate are depicted (e.g., —C(═O)— or —N), but atoms of the amino acid residue are not depicted.\n\n\n \n2. Isomeric Purity and Isolation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe surrogates of the invention can contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and, therefore, exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers, or diastereomers. According to the invention, the chemical structures depicted herein, and therefore the compounds of the invention, encompass the racemic form of compounds of the invention as well as all enantiomers and stereoisomers, that is, both the stereomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure, or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA surrogate of the invention is considered optically active or enantiomerically pure (i.e., substantially the R-form or substantially the S-form) with respect to a chiral center when the compound is about 90% ee (enantiomeric excess) or greater, preferably, equal to or greater than 95% ee with respect to a particular chiral center. A compound of the invention is considered to be in enantiomerically enriched form when the compound has an enantiomeric excess of greater than about 80% ee, preferably greater than about 85% ee. As used herein, a racemic mixture means about 50% of one enantiomer and about 50% of its corresponding enantiomer relative to all chiral centers in the molecule. Thus, the invention encompasses all enantiomerically pure, enantiomerically enriched, and racemic mixtures of compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one aspect, the surrogate has the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere the asterisk indicates any possible stereochemical conformation.

It is understood that if the amino acid surrogate of formula I is to be coupled at the C-terminus position of the compound, that other than a carboxyl terminus may be employed on such surrogate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in a preferred embodiment the invention provides ring-constrained amino acid surrogates for incorporation, by way of peptide synthesis methodologies, modified as appropriate, into polypeptide compounds, which compounds comprise a plurality of amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcept where both R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare H, it is to be appreciated that each surrogate of the invention can be in one of four different enantiomeric forms. Thus, by way of example, where the R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup is an amino acid side chain moiety of Arg, the compound may be generically shown as:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere each asterisk represents a chiral center which may be in any stereochemical configuration.

It may also be seen that analogous surrogates are possible and contemplated employing another group as the nitrogen protecting group or another amino acid side chain moiety or derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety as the R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup, or alternatively, where at least one thereof is alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkyl-N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, alkyl-OR\n8\n, alkyl-C(═O)OR\n8\n, C(═O)OR\n8\n, alkyl-NH\n2\n, alkyl-S—R\n8\n, alkyl-C(═O)N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, or a group of a formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere R\n8 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl and R\n12 \nis H or a second nitrogen protecting group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a surrogate is employed in the synthesis of compounds using conventional peptide synthetic methodologies and is at the C-terminal position, then the surrogate may be a compound that is bonded to a peptide solid support, such as a resin. In this instance the surrogate may be of the following general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere the oval depicts resin and a linker or another peptide solid support.

Thus in one aspect there are provided surrogates with an R\n1 \ngroup which is an amino acid side chain moiety of one of the following nineteen naturally-coded amino acid residues (omitting Pro), including the following:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each of the foregoing, rather than H in the R\n3 \nposition there may be any nitrogen protecting group; rather than —C(═O)OH the R\n4 \nposition may be alkyl, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nC(═O)OH, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(H)R\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OR\n11\n, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOH, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOBn, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOallyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)\n2\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n8\n)(CH\n2\n)\np\nN(R\n8\n)\n2 \nwhere R\n8 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl, R\n11 \nis a peptide solid support, m is an independent integer having a value between 0 and 6, q is an independent integer having a value between 1 and 6 and p is an integer having a value between 1 and 10; rather than H the R\n5 \nposition may be alkyl; and rather than H the R\n7 \nposition may be C(═O)alkyl or C(═O)(CH\n2\n)\nm\n(NR\n8\n)\n2\n.

Use of Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of making a compound including a surrogate, which compound is based on a known parent polypeptide that binds to a target of interest. The parent polypeptide may be a peptide, a polypeptide or a protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for identifying a secondary structure of a parent polypeptide which secondary structure is involved in or responsible for binding to a target of interest. Such method includes (a) providing a known parent polypeptide that binds to a target of interest with a known primary structure, such primary structure consisting of n amino acid residues; (b) constructing a plurality of compounds wherein a surrogate is substituted for an amino acid residue in the parent polypeptide, the substituted surrogate preferably having an R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup that is the same as the amino acid side chain moiety of the amino acid residue for which it is substituted, or which is a derivative of the amino acid side chain moiety of the amino acid residue for which it is substituted; (c) screening the plurality of compounds including a surrogate; and (d) selecting the compound exhibiting binding to the target of interest, whereby such compound comprises the secondary structure binding to the target of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for identifying a secondary structure of a parent polypeptide which secondary structure is involved in or responsible for binding to a target of interest, the method including the step of constructing a plurality of compounds wherein a surrogate is substituted for an amino acid residue in the parent polypeptide, the substituted surrogate preferably having an R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ngroup limited to H in both positions or methyl in one position and H in the remaining position. In this manner the effect of the amino acid side chain moiety on efficacy or any other ascertainable parameter may readily be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the method of the invention provides for the systematic analysis of a parent polypeptide to determine at least one active sequence or domain in the parent polypeptide that is involved in the interaction, such as binding, of the parent polypeptide with a target substance. As used herein, “parent polypeptide” refers to any sequence of amino acid residues that exhibits interaction, such as binding, to a target substance, and which may thus constitute a peptide, a polypeptide or a protein. The parent polypeptide is generally a polypeptide as defined herein, with from about 3 to about 100 amino acid residues, but the term parent polypeptide can also include larger constructs, generally considered in the art to be large polypeptides or proteins. To employ the method of the invention, the primary structure, which is to say the sequence, of at least part, and preferably of all, of the parent polypeptide must be available. However, it is not necessary to have any information concerning the secondary or tertiary structure of the parent polypeptide in order to practice the method of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parent polypeptide may be any sequence that exhibits binding to a receptor found on, for example, cells, tissues, organs or other biological materials. Examples of parent polypeptides include, without limitation, biologically active peptides, hormones, neurotransmitters, enzymes, antibodies and the like. Such parent polypeptides may transmit signals, directly or indirectly, as a result of binding to a receptor, and thus a parent polypeptide may be an agonist, an antagonist, or a mixed agonist-antagonist. Examples of suitable parent polypeptides of the invention include melanocortin-receptor specific peptides, urokinase-type tissue plasminogen activator protein, amyloid beta-protein related peptides, prion disease related peptides, vasopressin peptides, oxytocin peptides, natriuretic peptides, angiotensin peptides, calcitonin, calcitonin gene related peptide, opioid peptides, human growth hormone, human prolactin receptor ligands, various interferons, such as alpha-interferon, epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor, and various hypotensive peptides, fibrinolytic peptides, chemotactic peptides, growth promoter peptides, cell adhesion peptides and polypeptides, mitogens, immunomodulators and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, in order to employ the invention at least one assay or test to determine a parameter of a construct of the invention with respect to a receptor of interest. In one aspect, binding of the constructs of the invention to a receptor of interest is employed, and preferably with parallel determination of binding of the parent polypeptide to the receptor of interest. However, other parameters than binding may be employed, including various functional assay systems, efficacy assay systems, and the like. Such parameters may be determined with respect to any relevant unit of measure, including expression of one or more compounds in a functional assay system, Ki values, EC\n50 \nvalues, and the like. Thus in one preferred embodiment of the invention, a competitive inhibition or similar assay is employed, whereby the binding or functional activity of a construct of the invention can be directly compared to the parent polypeptide, and relative binding or functional activity thus directly determined. In other embodiments other assays or tests may be employed. These assays may, but need not, be functional assays. Examples of assays include any of a variety of competitive inhibition assays, direct binding assays, functional assays, and the like. It is also possible and contemplated to employ assays that determine, for example, whether a construct of the invention is an agonist, antagonist or mixed agonist-antagonist, and further where binding and function can separately be determined, to independently determine both receptor affinity and specificity as well as functional activity. Examples of such assays and tests are well known and well documented in the art, and in general one or more such assays or tests are known for any parent polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one method of the invention, the parent polypeptide is employed as the template for generation of one or more, and preferably of a series, of compounds each including at least one surrogate substituted for at least one amino acid residue of the parent polypeptide. In one aspect, the compounds with at least one surrogate may omit one or more amino acid residues found in the parent polypeptide. In another aspect, the compounds with at least one surrogate contain the same amino acid residues, or homologs thereof, as found in the parent polypeptide, with one or more amino acid residues substituted with a surrogate. In one aspect the substituted surrogate preferably has an R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup that is the same as the amino acid side chain moiety of the amino acid residue for which it is substituted, or which is a derivative of the amino acid side chain moiety of the amino acid residue for which it is substituted. In another aspect, the substituted surrogate preferably has an R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ngroup limited to H in both positions or methyl in one position and H in the remaining position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssume, for example, a parent polypeptide of six amino acid residues that binds to a specified and known receptor. The parent polypeptide may be described as:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX\n1\n—X\n2\n—X\n3\n—X\n4\n—X\n5\n—X\n6 \n\n\n\nA surrogate of this invention referred to as “S” is employed to synthesize a compound described as:\n\n \nX\n1\n—X\n2\n—X\n3\n—S—X\n5\n—X\n6 \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the compound X\n1\n—X\n2\n—X\n3\n—S—X\n5\n—X\n6\n, where the amino acid residue X\n4 \nis replaced by S, S has an R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup that is the same as the amino acid side chain moiety of X\n4\n, or which is a derivative of the amino acid side chain moiety of X\n4\n. In another aspect, where X\n4 \nis other than Gly or Ala, S has an R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ngroup H in both positions or methyl in one position and H in the remaining position. Binding of the compound X\n1\n—X\n2\n—X\n3\n—S—X\n5\n—X\n6\n, or some other measure of efficacy, is determined and compared to the parent polypeptide X\n1\n—X\n2\n—X\n3\n—X\n4\n—X\n5\n—X\n6\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible and contemplated that a systematic evaluation may be performed. Assume a peptide of fifteen amino acid residues binds to a specified known receptor. The peptide may be described as:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nNH\n2\n—X\n1\n—X\n2\n—X\n3\n—X\n4\n—X\n5\n—X\n6\n—X\n7\n—X\n8\n—X\n9\n—X\n10\n—X\n11\n—X\n14\n—X\n15\nCOOH\n\n\nIn this parent polypeptide, X may be any residue, which residue may repeat multiple times in any order or sequence. Thus the residue in position X\n1 \nmay be different from or the same as the residue in position X\n2\n, which may be different from or the same as the residues in position X\n1 \nor X\n3\n, and so on. A series of compounds are made wherein a surrogate “S” is substituted for an amino acid residue in a sequential or step-wise fashion.

Similarly, for each position all enantomeric forms may be employed and evaluated. Additionally, for each position a “knock-out” approach may be evaluated, in which where X is other than Gly or Ala, S has an R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ngroup H in both positions or methyl in one position and H in the remaining position.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt is also possible and contemplated to substitute one or more amino acid residues in a parent polypeptide with another amino acid residue, while also substituting one or more amino acid residues in a parent polypeptide with a surrogate of the invention. In one aspect a D-isomer is substituted for an L-isomer in a naturally occurring parent polypeptide. The corresponding amino acid sequence comprising at least one surrogate of formula I may be identical to a known parent polypeptide, or may be homologous thereto, such as a corresponding amino acid sequence that is at least 60% homologous, or more preferably is at least about 80% homologous. For these purposes, homology is determined by reference to identity of the known amino acid sequence to the compound but for the substitution by or addition of one or more surrogates of formula I. In another aspect, the invention provides ring-constrained amino acid surrogates of formula II useful to synthesize a compound that is modeled on a known peptide which binds to a receptor for a natriuretic peptide, but which includes one or more amino acid surrogates, such surrogates being either substituted for one or more amino acid residues contained in the known peptide, or in addition to the sequence comprising the known peptide. The known peptide may be any natriuretic peptide known in the art, including but not limited to those disclosed in any publication, patent, application or reference cited herein, including but not limited to the natriuretic peptides disclosed in U.S. Pat.

In one aspect, the known peptide is a peptide or homolog thereof disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,656,158, 4,824,937, 4,935,492, 5,159,061, 5,204,328, 5,376,635, 5,665,704, 5,846,932, 6,028,055, 6,407,211, 6,525,022, 6,586,396, or 6,818,619, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2004/0002458, 2004/0063630, or 2005/0176641, or International Patent Application Publications WO 2004/047871 or WO 2005/072055. The teachings of each of the foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated by reference as if set forth in full. In one aspect, the amino acid sequence which binds to a natriuretic peptide receptor is, prior to substitution, H-Met-cyclo(Cys-His-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Met-Asp-Arg-Ile-Ser-Cys)-Tyr-Arg-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:1). In another aspect the invention provides a ring-constrained amino acid surrogates of formula I useful to synthesize a compound that binds to a receptor for a natriuretic peptide, including a receptor for ANP or BNP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds made using one or more surrogates of formula I can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the compound, or a pharmaceutical composition including the compound, is used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term “patient” is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of this invention involve human patients, but this invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds disclosed herein, or made by methods disclosed herein, may be used for the treatment of any condition, syndrome or disease, and in particular for any condition, syndrome or disease for which a parent polypeptide has some efficacy. The compounds disclosed herein, or made by methods disclosed herein, can have one or more advantages relative to the parent polypeptide, including but not limited to advantages such as increased resistance to enzymatic degradation, increased circulation half life, increased bioavailability, increased efficacy, prolonged duration of effect and combinations of the foregoing. Such advantages are due, in whole or part, to use of the surrogates of formula I of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the compounds disclosed herein are used in the treatment of early stage, such as class 1, congestive heart failure. In another aspect, the compounds disclosed herein are used in the treatment of chronic or decompensated congestive heart failure. In another aspect, the compounds disclosed herein are used in the treatment of acute congestive heart failure, including acutely decompensated congestive heart failure of patients with dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalt Form of Compounds. The compounds of this invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include salts of aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of the present invention is basic, acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, carboxylic, citric, ethanesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, malonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. Acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared in a suitable solvent from the compound and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, citric, tartaric, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic acid. The acetate salt form is especially useful. Where the compounds of embodiments of this invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical Compositions. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the several embodiments of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound of this invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, manniton, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or time-release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a compound of this invention over a period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the actual quantity of compounds administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practical use, the compounds can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, dermal, transdermal, pulmonary, deep lung, inhalation, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, a composition including a compound of this invention may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual pharmaceutical compositions may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like. The active compound can also be administered intranasally as, for example, by liquid drops or spray.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Lyophilized single unit formulations may also be employed, such as are reconstituted with saline prior to administration, and thus do not require a preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders, such as lyophilized formulations, for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds as disclosed herein may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By “nasal administration” is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the compounds of this invention. The compounds may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The compounds may also be in a dry or powder formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, compounds may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a compound of this invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. Both dry powder inhalation and nebulized aerosols may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment of the present invention, compounds of this invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf in an aqueous solution, certain compounds of the present invention may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible and contemplated that the compound may be in a dried and particulate form. In a preferred embodiment, the particles are between about 0.5 and 6.0 μm, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the compounds may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection, typically a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a time release injectable formulation. In one embodiment, a compound of this invention is formulated with a PEG, such as poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a compound of this invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer (PLGA polymer) is employed, preferably a PLGA polymer with a hydrophilic end group, such as PLGA RG502H from Boehringer Ingelheim, Inc. (Ingelheim, Germany). Such formulations may be made, for example, by combining a compound of this invention in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, with a solution of PLGA in methylene chloride, and adding thereto a continuous phase solution of polyvinyl alcohol under suitable mixing conditions in a reactor. In general, any of a number of injectable and biodegradable polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a time release injectable formulation. The teachings of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,938,763, 6,432,438, and 6,673,767, and the biodegradable polymers and methods of formulation disclosed therein, are incorporated here by reference. The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of compound, the biodegradation rate of the polymer, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRoutes of Administration. If it is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The compounds of this invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the compounds of this invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, pulmonary administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, a compound of this invention is administered by means of a time release injectable formulation, such as a compound of this invention in a formulation with a PEG, poly(ortho ester) or PLGA polymer. In another aspect, a compound of this invention is administered by means of an automated delivery device providing subcutaneous delivery, either continuous or intermittent. Any of the foregoing methods and formulations are particularly applicable for treatment of chronic conditions or syndromes, including chronic congestive heart failure and particularly chronic decompensated congestive heart failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, any compound of this invention may be administered by subcutaneous administration, including all the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,396. In another aspect, a patient, particularly a patient who is relatively compensated or is a patient with congestive heart failure in an outpatient setting, may be administered a compound of this invention by methods and in doses as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0077537 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2003/079979. In another aspect, a patient may be administered a compound of this invention by means of the methods as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0113286. In yet another aspect, a patient who has undergone myocardial injury may be treated for cardiac remodeling by means of the methods as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0019890.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of this invention may also be administered by transdermal administration, including by means of the delivery system, including the apparatus, and the methods as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0034903. Similarly, the hydrogel formulations and solid state formulations disclosed therein may be adapted for use with the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutically Effective Amount. In general, the actual quantity of compound of this invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of this invention that is sufficient to induce a desired effect. In one aspect where a natriuretic peptide is employed as the parent polypeptide in making a compound including one or surrogates of formula I, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount that results in desired natriuresis, diuresis and/or vasodilation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the compounds of this invention are highly active. For example, the compound can be administered at about 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, or 100 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific compound selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n5. Synthetic Methods for Surrogates of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n \nThe surrogates of formula I of the invention can be obtained via standard, synthetic methodology. Some convenient methods are illustrated in the Schemes below. Starting materials useful for preparing the compounds of the invention and intermediates therefor, are commercially available or can be prepared from commercially available materials using known synthetic methods and reagents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtecting groups utilized herein denote groups which generally are not found in the final therapeutic compounds but which are intentionally introduced at some stage of the synthesis in order to protect groups which otherwise might be altered in the course of chemical manipulations. Such protecting groups are removed or converted to the desired group at a later stage of the synthesis and compounds bearing such protecting groups thus are of importance primarily as chemical intermediates (although some derivatives also exhibit biological activity). Accordingly, the precise structure of the protecting group is not critical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous reactions for the formation and removal of such protecting groups are described in a number of standard works including, for example, \nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n, Plenum Press, London and New York, 1973; Greene, Th.

The dipeptides were obtained in high yields, and usually no purification was required. Reduction of both the methyl ester and the amide group was done using diborane-tetrahydrofuran, with the secondary amines protected to give the di-Boc protected amino alcohol intermediates (4). Oxidation of the alcohols with pyridinium dichromate (PDC) with concomitant cyclization gave the piperazine-2-ones (5) in one step. Benzyl ether removal by hydrogenation, followed by protecting group exchange gave the Fmoc protected piperazine-2-ones (6). Finally, the primary alcohol was oxidized to the acid by any of a number of different methods (PDC, Jones oxidation, ruthenium chloride-sodium periodate, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical (TEMPO) oxidation) to give the final products (7).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of 2-(3-benzyloxy-2-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-propionylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl ester (3): To a solution of 10 mmol of Boc serine benzyl ether (1) in 30 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at −20° C. under nitrogen, was added 22 mmol of triethylamine, followed by the slow addition of 11.4 mmol of isobutylchloroformate. A white solid precipitated out. The slurry was stirred for 15 minutes, and then 11.1 mmol of α-amino ester (2) was added in one portion. The slurry was stirred at −20° C. for 30 minutes, and then allowed to warm up to room temperature, stirred for 2 hours, and then concentrated to dryness. The mixture was then partitioned between 50 mL of ethyl acetate/30 mL of 1N hydrochloric acid solution. The layers were separated, and the organic layer washed with 1×20 mL of 1N hydrochloric acid, and 1×20 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. Compounds (3) were usually obtained in yields above 90%, and no purification was required.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nAnalytical Data for Compounds (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR δ (CDCl\n3\n): 1.43 (s, 9H, \nt\nBu), 3.0- 3.18 (two sets of dd, 2H, CH\n2\n—Ph), 3.50-3.57 (t, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 3.68 (s, 3H, CH\n3\nO), 3.87-3.96 (br. d, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 4.23- 4.33 (br. m, 1H, CHN), 4.45-4.57 (dd, 2H, CH\n2\nO), 4.80-4.88 (m, 1H, CHN), 5.30- 5.37 (m, 1H, NH), 7.0-7.38 (a series of m, 10H, Ph), yield = 96%, t\nR \n= 6.88 min, (M\n+\n + 1) = 456.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR δ (CDCl\n3\n): 0.81-0.96 (a series of m, 6H, CH\n3\n), 1.00-1.16 (m, 1H, CH\n2\n), 1.30-1.45 (m, 1H, CH\n2\n), 1.45 (s, 9H, \nt\nBu), 1.80-1.96 (m, 1H, CH), 3.54-3.64 (dd, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 3.70 (s, 3H, CH\n3\nO), 3.82-3.96 (dd, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 4.28-4.40 (m, 1H, CHN), 4.51-4.61 (m, and s, 3H, CH\n2\nO, and CHN), 5.51-5.61 (br. d, 1H, NH), 7.12-7.37 (br. m, 5H, Ph), yield = quant., t\nR \n= 6.93 min, (M\n+\n + 1) = 423.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR δ (CDCl\n3\n): 1.45 (s, 9H, \nt\nBu), 3.73 (s, 3H, CH\n3\nO), 3.84-3.90 (m, 2H, CH\n2\nN), 4.01-4.17 (m, 2H, CH\n2\nO), 4.32- 4.38 (br. m, 1H, CHN), 4.54-4.58 (d, 2H, CH\n2\nO), 5.46-5.57 (d, 1H, NH), 7.05-7.12 (br. m, 1H, Ph), 7.24-7.40 (m, 4H, Ph), yield = quant., t\nR \n= 5.51 min, (M\n+\n + 1) = 367.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of Di-Boc-2-substituted-(2-amino-3-benzyloxy-propyl-amino)-ethanol (4): To a solution of 35 mmol of (3) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at room temperature under nitrogen, was added 200 mL of 1N diborane solution in tetrahydrofuran.

mL of tetrahydrofuran and 10 mL of water, was added 2.52 g (30 mmol) of solid sodium bicarbonate, followed by 3.36 g (13 mmol) of Fmoc-Cl. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours, diluted with ethyl acetate, the layers separated, and the organic layer washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated.\n \n(b) Hydroxyl group deprotection: For compounds containing a \nt\nBu ether protecting group: The compounds were deprotected with a solution of 90% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane for 1-2 hours, and then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and then concentrated. For compounds containing a Trt ether protecting group: the compounds were deprotected by adding a solution of 1-10% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane containing 2-10% tri-isopropyl silane. The reaction was instantaneous. The solution was then neutralized by pouring it into a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate.

However, it is to be understood that similar methods and schemes may be employed in the making of other α,α-disubstituted amino acids, where the substituents are either the same or different. Additionally, any method of making an α,α-disubstituted amino acid may be employed in the practice of this invention, and the practice of this invention is not limited to the methods of the following synthetic schemes. Thus any method known in the art for the synthesis of α,α-disubstituted amino acids may be employed in the practice of this invention.

Synthetic Methods for Compounds Including Surrogates of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds including one or more surrogates of formula I as disclosed in the several embodiments of this invention may be readily synthesized by any known conventional procedure for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid residue having its carboxyl group or other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid residue having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the compounds of this invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. The amino acid surrogates of the present invention may be incorporated into compounds of this invention by methods substantially similar to or identical to those employed with residues. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process for synthesizing the compounds may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid or amino acid surrogate in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence, which may include one or more amino acid surrogates, are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired compound. The resulting compound is cyclized to yield a cyclic compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of compounds of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield R. B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). \nAngew. Chem. \n24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., \nThe Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology\n, Vol. 2, Gross E. and Meienhofer J., Eds. Academic Press, 1-284 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn chemical syntheses of compounds, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz); aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl. Fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGuanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), Fmoc and Boc. Pbf is one preferred protecting group for Arg. Other preferred protecting groups include Z, Fmoc, and Boc. It is to be understood that particularly guanidino protecting groups may be cleaved and removed during the synthetic process, or may alternatively not be cleaved or removed, in which event the side chain with the protecting group forms a derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. Particularly where the protecting group is labile, and may be removed by some mechanism in vivo upon administration to a patient, the compound becomes a “prodrug”, which is to say a compound that is a drug precursor which, following administration to a patient, is converted to the desired drug form in vivo via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH or through enzyme action is converted to the desired drug form).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention described herein can be prepared using solid phase synthesis, either manually or by means of an automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth by the manufacturer, or by modifications of the manufacturer's protocols to improve the yield of difficult couplings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the compound by coupling a protected α-amino acid, α-amino acid surrogate or α-amino alcohol mimetic to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an α-amino-protected amino acid or α-amino-protected amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-α-[1-(9H-fluor-en-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art, such as by attaching an α-amino-protected alcohol mimetic to 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-yl-methanol linker attached to chloromethyl polystyrene resin. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids or amino acid surrogates are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the compound is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactive groups in a compound can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, compounds can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Methods for N-terminus modification, such as acetylation, or C-terminus modification, such as amidation or introduction of an N-acetyl group, are known in the art. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the compound will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are, in one embodiment, cyclized prior to cleavage from the resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the compound suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCl/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diispropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing cleavage of compounds from the solid phase following synthesis, the compound can be purified by any number of methods, such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C\n18 \ncolumn. Other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the compound, can also be employed. Once purified, the compound can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention with a substituted amide derivative C-terminus, typically an N-alkyl group, are prepared by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the compound by coupling a protected alpha amino acid or amino acid surrogate to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D. R., Morphy J. R., Rees D. C. Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage of resin-bound esters. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n37, 3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W. F. Kaiser E. T. Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n47:3258-3261 (1982). Such starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid or amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids or amino acid surrogates, the product cyclized and resin-treated with a solution of appropriate amine and aluminum chloride (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on) in dichloromethane. The resulting amide derivative compound is released in solution from the resin. The resin is filtered and the amide derivative compound recovered by concentration of solvent followed by precipitation with ether. The crude compound is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protective groups cleaved using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence of water and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by RP-HPLC using a O\n18 \ncolumn.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred method, compounds were synthesized by the following methods. Each of the compounds had one or two amino acid surrogates based on a keto-piperazine structure. The amino acid surrogates were synthesized as described above. The compounds were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. A manual synthetic approach was used for couplings immediately before and after incorporation of the keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following protocol was employed to attach an amino acid surrogate to resin, such as where the amino acid surrogate was in a terminal position. Rink amide resin (loading at 0.3 mmol/g, Advanced\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemTech) was allowed to swell in DMF for 30 minutes. Fmoc deprotection of the resin was accomplished using 20% piperidine/DMF for 20 minutes. Coupling of the resin with the selected Fmoc-protected keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate (2 eq) was accomplished by overnight incubation in DMF with PyBop (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq). If following Kaiser testing a positive result was obtained, the coupling reaction was conducting a second time. Acetylation was carried out using Ac\n2\nO (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following protocol was employed to attach a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate to peptide-resin. Coupling was carried out by mixing Fmoc-protected keto piperazine amino acid surrogate (2 eq), TBTU (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq) in DMF and allowing to incubate overnight, again with a repeat of the coupling reaction if a positive Kaiser test obtained. Acetylation was carried out using Ac\n2\nO (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following protocol was employed to couple an Fmoc-protected amino acid to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate on solid phase. In most instances at least two coupling cycles were needed, and frequently three cycles were employed. In a typical cycle Fmoc-protected amino acid (4 eq) was mixed with HOAt (4 eq) and DIC (4 eq) in DMF for 30 minutes. The resulted mixture was then mixed overnight in a SPE tube with a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate attached directly or through intermediates to resin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCouplings between amino acids that were not directly adjacent to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate in the sequence were conducted using standard protocols for solid phase peptide synthesis. The following protecting groups were employed: Boc for Lys and Orn, t-Butyl for Tyr and Ser, Trityl for Cys and His, O-\nt\n-Butyl for Asp and Pbf for Arg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds were cleaved from resin employing a mixture of TFA/thioanisole/phenol/H\n2\nO/EDT (87.5/2.5/2.5/5/2.5) (5 mL) for 3 hours. The resulting material was filtered and precipitated from cold ether under freezing conditions for one hour. Precipitated cysteinyl peptide was washed with cold ether at least three times before being use in an oxidation step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor cyclization to form disulfide bonds via air oxidation, crude cysteinyl compound was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7-8 using 5% NH\n4\nOH. The resulted solution was stirred slowly with 150 mg granular activated carbon for 2 days. Completion of cyclization was confirmed by LC-MS analysis before proceeding to the next process step. After cyclization, solid carbon was filtered from solution. The filtrate was lyophilized or dried in a speed-vac to obtain crude cyclic compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the invention, where the surrogate of formula I is bound to resin or other peptide solid support and is at the C-terminal position, may be synthesized by means of the following scheme.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurrogate (7) is prepared by the scheme of method A above, or any alternative method. Fmoc protected Sieber amide resin was treated by swelling the resin in a 1:1 mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane for 45 minutes, followed by filtering and washing with dimethylformamide. The washed resin was then deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with dimethylformamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) in dimethylformamide was added to the deprotected Sieber amide resin as prepared above, followed by solid PyBop and diisopropylethylamine, followed by additional dimethylformamide. The mixture was agitated overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resin was filtered, and washed with of dimethylformamide, capped with capping solution consisting of a 3:2:1 solution of dimethylformamide:acetic anhydride:pyridine for 30 minutes, filtered, and washed with dimethylformamide to provide surrogate (7) complexed to resin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) complexed to resin was deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with dimethylformamide to yield surrogate (7) complexed to resin. A solution of the desired Fmoc-AA-OH (4 eq, where AA is any desired amino acid) in dimethylformamide was added to surrogate (7) complexed to resin, followed by a solution of HCTU (60 mmol, 4 eq), and diisopropylethylamine (120 mmol, 8 eq.) in DMF and coupled overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resulting Fmoc-AA-surrogate (7)-resin was isolated by filtration and washed with dimethylformamide. In order to ensure complete coupling, the product was again treated with a solution of Fmoc-AA-OH as above overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resulting resin was filtered and washed with dimethylformamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting Fmoc-AA-surrogate (7)-resin was then capped with capping solution as above for 30 minutes. The resin was then filtered, washed with dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, MeOH, and diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThereafter each succeeding amino acidis coupled using conventional peptide coupling methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptional PEGylation of compounds made employing a surrogate of formula I of the invention may be performed, including by the methods described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEGylation of reactive amine groups, such as lysine or ornithine side chains, an omega amino aliphatic in the N-terminal position, or an amine group of a surrogate of formula I in the C-terminal position, was accomplished by dissolving 0.005 mmol purified compound in 2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide, followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.011 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-5K-OSu (5,000 Da MW methoxy-PEG with a succinimidyl propionate reactive group), with 17.7 μL (0.13 mmol, 20 eq.) of triethyl amine then added, and the slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. Excess PEG-5K-OSu was quenched by the addition of 7 μL (0.111 mmol, 10 eq.) of ethanol amine, and the reaction stirred overnight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEGylation of reactive carboxyl groups, such as Asp or Glu side chains or a terminal carboxyl on a compound on either a terminal amino acid residue or a terminal surrogate of formula I, is accomplished by coupling PEG-NH\n2 \n(PEG-amine), to the construct containing a carboxylate group in the side chain of Asp or Glu or at the C-terminus. The peptide construct (0.005 mmol) is dissolved in DMSO (2 mL), followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.011 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-NH\n2 \nand HOBt (0.01 mmol). The coupling is started by the addition of 0.0055 mmole of coupling reagent N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC). The slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature overnight. The PEGylated peptide construct is then purified by HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEGylation of reactive thiol groups, such as Cys or Hcys side chains or a thiol group in R\n1 \nof the surrogate of formula I, is accomplished by treating the compound in DMSO with PEG-methyl-maleimide reagent (SunBio, Orinda, Calif.) overnight. The PEGylated compound is then purified by HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing PEGylation, the resulting crude compound mixture is purified by HPLC, yielding a PEG derivatized compound including one or more amino acid surrogates.\n\n\n \n7. Assays for Determining Efficacy of Compounds Including Surrogates of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, any assay system appropriate for a parent polypeptide may be employed. The following exemplifies assay systems employed where the parent polypeptide is an ANP peptide, such as mini-ANP. Selected compounds including at least one surrogate of formula I were tested in assays to determine binding and functional status. The following assays were employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell culture. A cDNA clone that encodes for human natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) was purchased from Bio S&T Inc. (Montreal, Quebec). The cDNA clone was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HEK-293 cells. Stable clones were selected by culture of cells in the presence of G418 sulfate. Expression of NPRA was examined by binding of [\n125\nI]-atrial natriuretic peptide ([\n125\nI]-ANP) to membrane homogenates prepared from clonal cell lines. HEK-hNPRA cells were maintained in culture at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2 \nin Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, G418 sulfate (300 μg/mL) sodium glutamate (0.29 mg/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptromycin (100 ug/mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive binding assay. A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using crude membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-hNPRA cells. To prepare membrane homogenates, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 minutes at 4° C. in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4+5 mM EDTA). Cells were transferred from plates to polypropylene tubes and homogenized. Homogenates were centrifuged at 25,000×g for 20 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mM EDTA, homogenized and centrifuged at 25,000×g for 20 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 10 mM MgCl\n2 \nand stored at −80° C. until needed. On the day of an assay, homogenates were thawed and homogenized. Binding of [\n125\nI]-ANP was carried out in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1% BSA and 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. Homogenates (1-10 μg protein/well) were incubated with [\n125\nI]-ANP (25-30 pM) and increasing concentrations of competing ligands in Millipore filter plates for 120 minutes at 4° C. Assays were stopped by addition of cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) followed by filtration using a vacuum manifold. Bound radioactivity was determined using a gamma counter. Non-specific binding was defined by binding of [I\n125\n]-hANP to non-transfected HEK293 membranes. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism® curve-fitting software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral method for determination of EC\n50\n. Functional evaluation of compounds was performed by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cGMP in HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hNPR-A. HEK-NPRA cells were harvested by washing and centrifugation in Cell Dissociation Buffer (Gibco, Life Technologies). Pelleted cells were resuspended in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 200 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline and BSA (0.5 mg/mL). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in the above buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Cells (˜2×10\n5\n/well) were added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 minutes at 37° C. Following the pre-incubation period, cells were incubated for an additional 15 minutes in the presence of increasing concentrations of compounds. The reaction was terminated by lysis of the cells with temperature shock. The reaction plate was incubated in a dry ice/ethanol bath for 15 minutes followed by incubation at 90° C. for 10 minutes. Accumulation of cGMP was measured using the cGMP Flashplate RIA (Perkin-Elmer). Data analysis and EC\n50 \nvalues were determined by using nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism® software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The mass values were determined using a Waters MicroMass ZQ device utilizing a positive mode. Mass determinations were compared with calculated values and expressed in the form of mass weight plus two divided by two (M+2)/2, unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProton NMR data was obtained using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were obtained after dissolving compounds in a deuteriated solvent such as chloroform, DMSO, or methanol as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHPLC measurements were made using a Waters Alliance HT with a YMC Pack Pro C-18 column (4.6×50 mm, 3μ) eluted at 1 mL/minute in a step-wise procedure. Solvent A (water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid v/v) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid v/v) were used as mobile phases. For analysis of keto piperazine intermediates, the column was equilibrated with 10% B and then B was increased to 90% over a period of 8 minutes. For analysis of peptides, the column was equilibrated with 2% B and then B was increased to 90% over a period of 8 minutes.\n\n\n \n8.
