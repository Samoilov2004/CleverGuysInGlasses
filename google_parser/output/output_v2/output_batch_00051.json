No. 60/734,734, entitled “N-Alkylated Cyclic Peptide Melanocortin Agonists”, filed on Nov. 8, 2005, and the specification and claims thereof are incorporated here by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Field of the Invention (Technical Field)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to C-terminus N-alkylated cyclic peptides that are agonists for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R), and which may be used in the treatment of sexual dysfunction and other conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote that the following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanocortin Receptors. A family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin-1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2-R) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant work has been done in determining the structure of melanocortin receptors, including both the nucleic acid sequences encoding for the receptors and the amino acid sequences constituting the receptors. MC4-R is a G protein-coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor that is believed to be expressed primarily in the brain. Inactivation of this receptor by gene targeting has been reported to result in mice with the maturity-onset obesity syndrome that is associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia (Huszar D, Lynch C A, Fairchild-Huntress V, et al. Targeted disruption of the melanocortin-4 receptor results in obesity in mice. \nCell \n88:131-141, 1997). MC4-R is a molecular target for therapeutic intervention in energy homeostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds specific for MC4-R, and secondarily compounds specific for MC3-R or MC5-R, are believed to be useful in regulation of mammalian energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain. MC4-R agonists are believed to be useful for treating sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction, and for decreasing food intake and body weight gain, such as for treatment of obesity. Such compounds may also be employed for treatment of depression and related disorders, decreasing voluntary ethanol consumption, and the like. MC4-R antagonists, by contrast, are believed to be useful for weight gain aid, such as for use in treatment of cachexia, sarcopenia, wasting syndrome or disease, and anorexia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSexual Dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction, including both penile erectile dysfunction or impotence and female sexual dysfunction, is a common medical problem. Significant effort has been devoted over the last twenty or more years to develop methods, devices and compounds for treatment of sexual dysfunction. While more effort has been undertaken for treatment of penile erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction is also an area to which significant research and effort has been devoted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, commonly used orally administered drugs for treatment of sexual dysfunction in the male are phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, increasing the persistence of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and thereby enhancing erectile response. Such drugs include Viagra®, a brand of sildenafil, Levitra®, a brand of monohydrochloride salt of vardenafil, and Cialis®, a brand of tadalafil. Another drug approved in Europe for treating male erectile dysfunction is Ixense®, a brand of apomorphine that is a non-selective dopa receptor agonist. Oral and nasal formulations of apomorphine have undergone clinical evaluation. There are several other medical treatment alternatives currently available depending on the nature and cause of the impotence problem. Some men have abnormally low levels of the male hormone testosterone, and treatment with testosterone injections or pills may be beneficial. However, comparatively few impotent men have low testosterone levels. For many forms of erectile dysfunction, treatment may be undertaken with drugs injected directly into the penis, including drugs such as papaverin, prostaglandin E\n1\n, phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. These all work primarily by dilating the arterial blood vessels and decreasing the venous drainage. Urethral inserts, such as with suppositories containing prostaglandin, may also be employed. In addition, a variety of mechanical aids are employed, including constriction devices and penile implants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of other agents have been shown to induce or facilitate penile erection in laboratory animals. These include very diverse classes of ligands such as oxytocin (Benelli A., Poggioli R., Luppi P., Ruini L., Bertolini A., Arletti R., Oxytocin enhances, and oxytocin antagonism decreases, sexual receptivity in intact female rats. \nNeuropeptides \n27:245-50 (1994)), vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, melanotropins, and ACTH as well as their analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of treatments have also been explored for female sexual dysfunction, including use of sildenafil, although the Food and Drug Administration has not specifically approved such use. Testosterone propionate has also been employed to increase or augment female libido.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanocortin Agonist Peptides. Melanocortin receptor-specific compounds have been explored for use of treatment of sexual dysfunction. In one report, a cyclic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (“α-MSH”) analog, Ac-Nle-cyclo(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH\n2\n, was evaluated for erectogenic properties for treatment of men with erectile dysfunction.

Hruby, M. E. Hadley and F. Al-Obeidi, entitled \nCyclic Analogs of Alpha\n-\nMSH Fragments, \nand in U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,576, issued Feb. 3, 1998, to V. J. Hruby, M. E. Hadley and F. Al-Obeidi, entitled \nLinear Analogs of Alpha\n-\nMSH Fragments. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional related peptides are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,576,290, 5,674,839, 5,714,576 and 6,051,555. These peptides are described as being useful for both the diagnosis and treatment of psychogenic sexual dysfunction in males and females. These peptides are related to the structure of melanocortins. Other peptides are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,735 and U.S. Published Patent Applications Nos. 2001/0056179 and 2002/0004512.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide Ac-Nle-cyc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,579,968, issued Jun. 17, 2003, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,794,489, Sep. 21, 2004, and is employed for treatment of erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that erectile response to melanocortin receptor-specific compounds, and both male and female sexual response in general, is at least in part related to the central tetrapeptide sequence, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9 \n(SEQ ID NO:1) of native α-MSH. In general, all natural melanocortin peptides share the same active core sequence, His-Phe-Arg-Trp (SEQ ID NO:1), including melanotropin neuropeptides and adrenocorticotropin. While the mechanism of His-Phe-Arg-Trp (SEQ ID NO:1) induction of erectile response has not been fully elucidated, it is generally accepted that it involves the central nervous system, and binding to MC3-R and/or MC4-R, and according to most researchers, MC4-R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth cyclic and linear α-MSH peptides have been studied for sexual dysfunction; however, the peptides heretofore evaluated have had an —NH\n2 \ngroup at the C-terminus, or, as in the case of Ac-Nle-cyclo(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH, an —OH group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, this application is related to U.S. patent application Ser.

In one aspect of this embodiment, the cyclic hexapeptide has an N-terminus Ac or NH\n2 \ngroup. In another aspect of this embodiment, the cyclic hexapeptide is cyclized by formation of an amide bond between an amino group of a side chain of an amino acid in the 1 position or an amino group of the N-terminus group of the amino acid in the 1 position and a side chain carboxyl group of an amino acid residue at the 6 position.

In another aspect of this embodiment, the hexapeptide is cyclized by formation of a covalent bond comprising an amide, disulfide, thioether, Schiff base, reduced Schiff base, imide, secondary amine, carbonyl, urea, hydrazone or oxime bond. In another aspect of this embodiment, the core sequence is in the 2 to 5 positions and is either His-D-Phe-X-Nal 1 or His-D-Phe-X-Nal 2 and is cyclized through the amino acids in the 1 and 6 positions. In another aspect of this embodiment, the core sequence is in the 2 to 5 positions and is either Trp-D-Phe-X-Nal 1 or His-D-Phe-X-Nal 2 and is cyclized through the amino acids in the 1 and 6 positions. In another aspect of this embodiment, the core sequence is in the 2 to 5 positions and is His-D-Phe-X-Trp, and is cyclized through the amino acids in the 1 and 6 positions. In each of the foregoing aspects of this embodiment, D-Phe may be substituted with one, two or more substituents, and thus D-Phe includes any D-isomer of a phenylalanine wherein the phenyl ring is substituted with one or more ring substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage. D-Phe may further be and includes D-phenylglycine and D-homophenylananine, optionally with one or more ring substituents as described.

It is also possible to synthesize a specific diastereoisomer of a cyclic peptide of any of the foregoing formulas by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration. In a preferred embodiment, the cyclic peptides of the foregoing formulas are synthesized using reagents of known configurations, and accordingly have a specific diastereoisomeric form.\n\n\n \n \n \n

Certain terms as used throughout the specification and claims are defined as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “bind,” “binding,” “complex,” and “complexing,” as used throughout the specification and claims, are generally intended to cover all types of physical and chemical binding, reactions, complexing, attraction, chelating and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “peptides” of this invention can be a) naturally-occurring, b) produced by chemical synthesis, c) produced by recombinant DNA technology, d) produced by biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, e) produced by methods resulting from a combination of methods a through d listed above, or f) produced by any other means for producing peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy employing chemical synthesis, a preferred means of production, it is possible to introduce various amino acids which do not naturally occur along the chain, modify the N- or C-terminus, and the like, thereby providing for improved stability and formulation, resistance to protease degradation, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “peptide” as used throughout the specification and claims is intended to include any structure comprised of two or more amino acids, including chemical modifications and derivatives of amino acids. The amino acids forming all or a part of a peptide may be naturally occurring amino acids, stereoisomers and modifications of such amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically modified amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like, so that the term “peptide” includes pseudopeptides and peptidomimetics, including structures which have a non-peptidic backbone. The term “peptide” also includes dimers or multimers of peptides. A “manufactured” peptide includes a peptide produced by chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, combinations of the foregoing or, in general, made by any other method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “amino acid side chain moiety” used in this invention, including as used in the specification and claims, includes any side chain of any amino acid, as the term “amino acid” is defined herein. This thus includes the side chain moiety present in naturally occurring amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in modified naturally occurring amino acids, such as glycosylated amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. For example, the side chain moiety of any amino acid disclosed herein is included within the definition. A “derivative” of an amino acid side chain moiety is included within the definition of an amino acid side chain moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “derivative” of an amino acid side chain moiety includes any modification to or variation in any amino acid side chain moieties, including a modification of naturally occurring amino acid side chain moieties. By way of example, derivatives of amino acid side chain moieties include straight chain or branched, cyclic or noncyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated, alkyl, aryl or aralkyl moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “amino acids” used in this invention, and the term as used in the specification and claims, include the known naturally occurring protein amino acids, which are referred to by both their common three letter abbreviation and single letter abbreviation. See generally \nSynthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, \nG A Grant, editor, W.H. Freeman & Co., New York (1992), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the text and table set forth at pages 11 through 24.

In a preferred embodiment, the N-alkylated α-MSH cyclic peptides of this invention have a C-terminus group which is —NH—CH\n3\n, —NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, —N(CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n)\n2\n, —NH—CH—(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, or —NH—CH\n2\n—CH—(CH\n3\n)\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides certain N-alkylated cyclic peptides, specific for one or more melanocortin receptors, and which in some embodiments are an agonist with respect to such receptor or receptors. However, the peptides of this invention need not be agonists, and need not have significant specificity for any one given melanocortin receptor. In general, there is no rank order correlation between affinity for a given receptor, such as MC4-R, measured by either competitive inhibition with α-MSH or an analog, such as NDP-MSH, including K\ni \nvalue, and effectiveness for treatment of sexual dysfunction. Such peptides can preferably be employed in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, and may be characterized in part as inducing an erectile response in mammalian males, including but not limited to rodents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomologs of the cyclic peptide include those sequences with a single amino acid substitution at any location. In one embodiment of the invention, the substitution is made by any of the naturally occurring amino acids or unnaturally occurring amino acids. In a preferred embodiment the substitution is made by Phe, Lys, Trp, Tyr, Phe(4-Cl), Orn, Nal 1, Nal 2, or Bip. Homologs of the peptide may also include those sequences where one amino acid with an aromatic ring has been substituted for another amino acid with a different aromatic ring. An example of this substitution would be replacing a Phe residue with a Trp residue. Homologs of the peptide may also include those sequences where an amino acid with a charged side chain is replaced by another amino acid with or without a charged side chain. Examples of this include, without limitation, replacing an Arg residue (positively charged side chain) with a Lys (positively charged side chain) or replacing a His (positively charged side chain) with a Phe (nonpolar side chain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention provides certain cyclic peptides having a C-terminus N-alkyl group, which cyclic peptides are specific for one or more melanocortin receptors, preferably MC4-R, and alternatively MC4-R and MC3-R. Most preferably the N-alkylated cyclic peptides bind to MC4-R with high affinity, with a Ki value of at least 100 nM, preferably of at least 10 nM and most preferably from about 0.01 nM to about 2 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cyclic peptide can be obtained by inducing the formation of a covalent bond between an amino group at the N-terminus of the peptide, if provided, and a carboxyl group of a reactive amino acide side chain moiety, if provided. A cyclic peptide can also be obtained by forming a covalent bond between a terminal reactive group and a reactive amino acid side chain moiety, or between two reactive amino acid side chain moieties. A cyclic peptide can also be obtained by forming a disulfide covalent bond between two sulfhydryl group containing amino acid side chain moieties or a terminal sulfhydryl group and a sulfhydryl group in another amino acid side chain moiety. Peptides with lanthionine, cystathionine, or penthionine covalent bonds can also be formed, such as cyclic bonds formed from cysteine, homocysteine or penicillamine amino acid residues. These bonds are thioether-bridged bonds. Galande, A. K. and Spatola, A. F. —Lett. Pept. Sci. 8, 247 (2001), is incorporated herein by reference. Thus a cyclic peptide can also be obtained by forming a thioether covalent bond between two reactive amino acid side chain moieties or between a terminal reactive group and a reactive amino acid side chain moiety. One skilled in the art would know that the means by which a given peptide is made cyclic is determined by the reactive groups present in the peptide and the desired characteristics of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the invention are further characterized in that they are preferable not antagonists for any MC receptor, and are preferably inactive, agonists or partial agonists as to all MC receptors other than MC4-R. All peptides of the invention are functional agonists as to MC4-R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of this invention may be readily synthesized by any known conventional procedure for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid or residue thereof having its carboxyl group or other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid or residue thereof having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the cyclic peptides of this invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process for synthesizing the cyclic peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. The resulting peptide is then cyclized to yield a cyclic peptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R. B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). \nAngew Chem \n24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., \nThe Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, \nVol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz); aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl. Fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGuanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pmc is a preferred protecting group for Arg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company) automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin or an oxime resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-α-[1-(9H-fluor-en-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the peptides of the present invention, in one preferred embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide can, in one embodiment, be cyclized prior to cleavage from the peptide resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the peptide suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCl/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclized peptides can then be cleaved from solid phase, using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence of water and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C\n18 \ncolumn, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the present invention have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N-alkyl group, and may conveniently be prepared by solid phase synthesis which is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D. R. et al., Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters. —Tetrahedron Letters, 37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W. F. and Kaiser E. T., Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. —J. Org. Chem., 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or an oxime resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids, the peptide cyclized and the peptide-resin treated with a solution of appropriate amine (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on). Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, and peptides employing an oxime resin may be cleaved by DCM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulation and Utility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications.

In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active peptide in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual constructs may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclic peptides may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of this invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By “nasal administration” is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the cyclic peptides of this invention. The peptides may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of this invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf in an aqueous solution, the cyclic peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, cyclic peptides of this invention may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of this invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. In one aspect of this embodiment, the cyclic peptide may be in a dried and particulate form, for example particles between about 0.5 and 6.0 μm, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the peptides may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of this invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection, typically a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a time release injectable formulation. In one embodiment, a cyclic peptide of this invention is formulated with a polyethylene glycol, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a cyclic peptide of this invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer is employed. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a time release injectable formulation. The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of cyclic peptide, the bioerosion rate of the polymer, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRoutes of Administration. If it is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The peptides of this invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutically Effective Amount. In general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of this invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a peptide or pharmaceutical composition of this invention that is sufficient to therapeutically alleviate sexual dysfunction in a patient, or to prevent or delay onset or recurrence of the sexual dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the cyclic peptides of this invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be administered at about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic Application in Males. The cyclic peptides and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be used to treat male sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction or impotence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic Application in Females. The cyclic peptides and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be used to treat female sexual dysfunction, including without limitation sexual arousal disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnostic Application. The cyclic peptides of this invention may be used for diagnostic purposes, to diagnose causes of erectile dysfunction in males, or sexual dysfunction in mammals generally. Thus, the cyclic peptides may be administered and the erectile reaction of the patient monitored.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplications for Other Indications. In addition to treatment of sexual dysfunction, compounds of the current invention may be employed for the treatment of other and additional conditions. These include treatment of obesity, suppression of food intake, induced weight loss, increased energy expenditure, treatment of depression, treatment of anxiety, treatment of diabetes, including maintenance of insulin sensitivity, reduction of voluntary ethanol consumption, and other diseases, conditions and syndromes for which a melanocortin receptor agonist or partial agonist, including specifically an MC3-R or MC4-R agonist or partial agonist, may be efficacious.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination Therapy. It is also possible and contemplated to use C-terminus N-alkyl cyclic peptides of this invention in combination with other drugs or agents, such as for treatment of sexual dysfunction. These other drugs and agents may include agents that induce erectile activity, including phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, testosterone, prostaglandin and the like. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, cyclic peptides of the invention are used in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor or an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The teachings and disclosure of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/139,730, filed May 26, 2005, and entitled “Multiple Agent Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction”, are incorporated here by reference as if set forth in full.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to the patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic peptide of this invention in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. The cyclic peptide of this invention may be administered simultaneously with, prior to or subsequent to administration with a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Preferably the peptide of this invention is administered within one hour, preferably within less than one-half hour, of administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. However, for certain forms of combination therapy, such as for example in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on an independent schedule, such that there is no set or specific temporal relationship between administration of the peptide of this invention and the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Thus, for example, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on a daily or other dose, or by means of patches or other continuous administration schedules, with administration of the peptide of this invention when desired or needed by the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to a patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic peptide of this invention in combination with another compound that is useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction. In a preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is female sexual dysfunction. In an especially preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is erectile dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a cyclic peptide of this invention and a second compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. In an embodiment of the composition, the additional compounds useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction are preferably selected from but not limited to the group consisting of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor; a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor; prostaglandins; apomorphine; oxytocin modulators; α-adrenergic antagonists; androgens; selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs); buproprion; vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP); neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (NEP); and neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists (NPY).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the method and composition, the second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent is testosterone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of combination therapy, the second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent is a type V phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitor. For example, the PDE-5 inhibitor may be Viagra®, a brand of sildenafil, Levitra®, a brand of monohydrochloride salt of vardenafil, or Cialis®, a brand of tadalafil. Other PDE-5 inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/139,730, filed May 26, 2005, and entitled “Multiple Agent Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction”, incorporated here by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the composition above, the compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction is an estrogen agonist/antagonist. In one embodiment, the estrogen agonist/antagonist is (−)-cis-6-phenyl-5-[4-4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-napth-thalene-2-ol (also known as lasofoxifene) or an optical or geometric isomer thereof; a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, N-oxide, ester, quaternary ammonium salt; or a prodrug thereof. More preferably, the estrogen agonist/antagonist is in the form of a D-tartrate salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the composition above, the estrogen agonist/antagonist is selected from the group consisting of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, raloxifene, droloxifene, toremifene, centchroman, idoxifene, 6-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-[4-(2-piperidine-1-yl-ethoxy)-benzyl]-napthalen-2-ol, {4-[2-(2-aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-[6-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-benzo[b]thiopehn-3-yl]-methanone, EM-652, EM-800, GW 5368, GW 7604, TSE-424 and optical or geometric isomers thereof; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, N-oxides, esters, quaternary ammonium salts, and prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, a cyclic peptide of this invention may be used in combination with any known mechanical aids or devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides kits for the treatment of sexual dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction), the kits comprising: a first pharmaceutical composition including a cyclic peptide of this invention; a second pharmaceutical composition comprising a second compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction; and, a container for the first and second compositions.\n\n\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nCompetitive Inhibition Assay Using [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH\n\n\n \n \n \nA competitive inhibition binding assay was conducted for selected compounds using membranes prepared from transfected HEK-293 cells expressing hMC3-R, hMC4-R or hMC5-R, and B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing MC1-R), using respectively 0.4 nM, 0.2 nM, 0.4 nM and 0.1 nM [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH (New England Nuclear) in 25 mM HEPES buffer containing 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.3 mM 1,10 phenanthroline and protease inhibitors at pH 7.5. The assay tube also contained a chosen concentration of the test peptide of this invention, typically a 1 μM concentration, for determining its efficacy in inhibiting the binding of [I\n125\n]NDP-α-MSH to the receptor. Non-specific binding was measured by complete inhibition of binding of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH in the assay with the presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay mixture was incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C., then filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice cold phosphate buffered saline. The filter was dried and counted in a gamma counter for remaining radioactivity bound to the membranes. 100% specific binding was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. The cpm obtained in presence of test peptides was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate. The Ki (nM) of certain peptides of the invention were determined using similar assay protocols and testing peptides over a wider dose range.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nGeneral Method for EC\n50 \nDetermination in functional Activity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFunctional evaluation of peptides at melanocortin receptors was performed by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cAMP in HEK-293 cells expressing hMC3-R, hMC4-R or hMC5-R, and in B-16 mouse melanoma cells expressing MC1-R. Cells suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were plated in 96 well plates at a density of 0.5×10\n5 \ncells per well. Cells were incubated with the test peptides in the presence or absence of NDP-α-MSH for 1 hour at 37° C. cAMP levels in the cell lysates were measured using an EIA kit (Amersham). Data analysis and EC\n50 \nvalues were determined using nonlinear regression analysis with Prism Graph-Pad software.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nFunctional Status\n\n\n \n \n \nThe agonist/antagonist status with respect to MC1-R, MC4-R and MC5-R of certain peptides of the invention was determined. Antagonistic activity was determined by measuring the inhibition of α-MSH-induced or NDP-α-MSH-induced cAMP levels following exposure to the peptides as in the preceding descriptions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssay for agonist. Evaluation of the molecules to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells expressing hMC4-R for agonistic activity was done by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cAMP following treatment. Confluent HEK-293 cells over-expressing MC4-R receptors were detached by enzyme free cell suspension buffer. Cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in a 96 well plate at a density of 0.5×10\n5 \ncells per well and pre-incubated for 60 minutes. The cells were then challenged with the test peptides dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration range of 0.05-5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 μL for 1 hour at 37° C. The concentration of DMSO was held at 1% in the assay mixture. NDP-α-MSH was used as the reference agonist. At the end of the incubation period the cells were disrupted by the addition of 50 μL lysis buffer from the cAMP EIA kit (Amersham). Complete rupture of the cells was ensured by pipetting the cells. cAMP levels in the cell lysates were measured after appropriate dilution using the EIA kit (Amersham) method. Data analysis and EC\n50 \nvalues were determined by using nonlinear regression analysis with the Prism Graph-Pad software. Peptides at a concentration of 5000 nM with a response ratio compared to NDP-α-MSH of 0.7 and above were classified as full agonists. Peptides with a ratio from 0.1 to 0.7 were classified as partial agonists.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nFood Intake and Body Weight Change\n\n\n \n \n \nChange in food intake and body weight is evaluated for selected peptides when administered by an ICV route. Rats with indwelling intracerebroventricular cannulas (ICV rats) are obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottdale, Pa.). Animals are individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and powdered food (LabDiet, 5P00 Prolab RMH 3000) is provided ad libitum. For 1 week before treatment, 24-hour food intake and body weight change is recorded to assess a baseline for the group during vehicle treatment. The rats are dosed ICV with vehicle or selected peptides (1-3 nmol). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing are determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour and 72 hour periods after dosing are also measured to determine reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effects back to baseline levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChange in food intake and body weight is evaluated for selected peptides administered by IV or IP routes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats are obtained from Taconic (Germantown, N.Y.). Animals are individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and powdered (LabDiet, 5P00 Prolab RMH 3000) food is provided ad libitum. For 1 week before treatment, 24-hour food intake and body weight change is recorded to assess a baseline for the group during vehicle treatment. The rats are dosed IV or IP with vehicle or selected peptides (0.5-3 mg/kg). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing are determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour and 72 hour periods after dosing are also measured to determine reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effects back to baseline levels.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nPenile Erection Induction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of peptides to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats was evaluated with selected peptides. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies were performed between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Groups of 4-8 rats were administered peptides at a variety of doses via an intravenous (IV) route, and may alternatively be administered peptide by an intracerebroventricular (ICV) route. Immediately after treatment, rats were placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation. Rats administered peptide by an IV route were observed for one hour, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs are recorded in 10-minute bins. For rats administered peptide by an ICV routes, rats are observed for two hours.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nDetermination of Mass and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mass values of peptides of the invention were determined using a Waters MicroMass ZQ device utilizing a positive mode. Mass determinations were compared with calculated values and expressed in the form of mass weight plus one (M+1 or M+H).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProton NMR data was obtained using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were obtained after dissolving peptides in a deuteriated solvent such as chloroform, DMSO, or methanol as appropriate.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nAc-Nle-cyclo(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n3  \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide Ac-Nle-cyclo(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n3 \nwas synthesized by conventional peptide synthesis methods.

It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts can usually be converted to compounds in free form, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals can include for example the solvent used for crystallization (present as solvates).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula II used as starting materials may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula IV\n\n \n \n\nwith a compound of formula V\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n and R\n6\n are as defined above, and Y\n1\n and Y\n2\n are identical or different leaving groups as defined above for Y. The reaction conditions are those mentioned above for the reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of formula III.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula IV and V are known or may be produced in accordance with known procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro in cell-free kinase assays and in cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase, and are useful as pharmaceuticals to treat conditions caused by a malfunction of signal cascades connected with Focal Adhesion Kinase, in particular tumors as described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFocal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a key enzyme in the integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascade (\nD. Schlaepfer et al., Prog Biophys Mol Biol 1999, 71, 435-478\n). Interaction between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is transduced as intracellular signals important for growth, survival and migration through cell surface receptors, integrins. FAK plays an essential role in these integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascades. The trigger in the signal transduction cascade is the autophosphorylation of Y397. Phosphorylated Y397 is a SH2 docking site for Src family tyrosine kinases. The bound c-Src kinase phosphorylates other tyrosine residues in FAK. Among them, phsophorylated Y925 becomes a binding site for the SH2 site of Grb2 small adaptor protein. This direct binding of Grb2 to FAK is one of the key steps for the activation of down stream targets such as the Ras-ERK2/MAP kinase cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of endogenous FAK signalling results in reduced motility and in some cases induces cell death. On the other hand, enhancing FAK signalling by exogenous expression increases cell motility and transmitting a cell survival signal from ECM. In addition FAK is overexpressed in invasive and metastatic epithelial, mesenchymal, thyroid and prostate cancers. Consequently, an inhibitor of FAK is likely to be a drug for anti-tumor growth and metastasis. The compounds of the invention are thus indicated, for example, to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by a neoplastic disease, in particular breast tumor, cancer of the bowel (colon and rectum), stomach cancer and cancer of the ovary and prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of liver, melanoma, bladder tumor and cancer of head and neck.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relation between FAK inhibition and immuno-system is described e.g. in \nG.A. van Seventer et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 2001, 31, 1417-1427\n. Therefore, the compounds of the invention are, for example, useful to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by immune system disorders, diseases or disorders mediated by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, mast cells and/or eosinophils e.g. acute or chronic rejection of organ or tissue allo- or xenografts, atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion due to vascular injury such as angioplasty, restenosis, hypertension, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CNS disease such as Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, infectious disease such as AIDS, septic shock or adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia/reperfusion injury e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, or traumatic shock. The agent of the invention are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes (type I and II) and the disorders associated with therewith, respiratory diseases such as asthma or inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders or illnesses, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis), inflammatory eye diseases, e.g. Sjoegren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis or uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are active in a FAK assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC\n50\n in the range of 1 nM to 100 nM. Particularly active are the compounds Example No. 3-12 and No. 3-17 described hereinbelow showing IC\n50\n vales in the range of 1 to 5 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention exhibit also ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein of 70 kD) protein tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity. ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase interaction of the agents of the invention may be demonstrated by their ability to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. LAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell) by human ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase in aqueous solution, as described in the Examples. The compounds of the invention are thus also indicated for the prevention or treatment of disorders or diseases where ZAP-70 inhibition inhibition play a role.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are active in a ZAP-70 assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC\n50\n in the range of 1 µM to 10 µM, e.g. the compounds Example No. 2 and No. 3-2 described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention are also good inhibitors of the IGF-IR (insulin like growth factor receptor 1) and are therefore useful in the treatment of IGF-1R mediated diseases for example such diseases Include proliferative diseases, such as tumours, like for example breast, renal, prostate, colorectal, thyroid, ovarian, pancreas, neuronal, lung, uterine and gastro-intestinal tumours as well as osteosarcomas and melanomas. The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using a cellular \"Capture ELISA\". In this assay the activity of the compounds of the invention against Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induced autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR is determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention also exhibit powerful inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the fusion protein of NPM-ALK. This protein tyrosine kinase results from a gene fusion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), rendering the protein tyrosine kinase activity of ALK ligand-independent. NPM-ALK plays a key role in signal transmission in a number of hematopoetic and other human cells leading to hematological and neoplastic diseases, for example in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), specifically in ALK+ NHL or Alkomas, in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and neuroblastomas. (\nDuyster J et al. 2001 Oncogene 20, 5623-5637\n). In addition to NPM-ALK, other gene fusions have been identified in human hematological and neoplastic diseases; mainly TPM3-ALK (a fusion of nonmuscle tropomyosin with ALK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using known methods, for example using the recombinant kinase domain of the ALK in analogy to the VEGF-R kinase assay described in \nJ. Wood et al. Cancer Res. 60, 2178-2189 (2000\n). In vitro enzyme assays using GST-ALK protein tyrosine kinase are performed in 96-well plates as a filter binding assay in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH = 7.5, 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MnCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 µCi/assay (=30 µl) [γ-\n33\nP]-ATP, 2 µM ATP, 3 µg/ml poly (Glu, Tyr 4:1) Poly-EY (Sigma P-0275), 1 % DMSO, 25 ng ALK enzyme. Assays are incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. Reactions are terminated by adding 50 µl of 125 mM EDTA, and the reaction mixture is transferred onto a MAIP Multiscreen plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), previously wet with methanol, and rehydrated for 5 min with H\n2\nO. Following washing (0.5 % H\n3\nPO\n4\n), plates are counted in a liquid scintillation counter. IC\n50\n values are calculated by linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition. Compared with the control without inhibitor, the compounds of formula I inhibit the enzyme activity by 50 % (IC\n50\n), for example in a concentration of from 0.001 to 0.5 µM, especially from 0.01 to 0.1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I potently inhibit the growth of human NPM-ALK overexpressing murine BaF3 cells (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The expression of NPM-ALK Is achieved by transfecting the BaF3 cell line with an expression vector pClneo™ (Promega Corp., Madison WI, USA) coding for NPM-ALK and subsequent selection of G418 resistant cells. Non-transfected BaF3 cells depend on IL-3 for cell survival. In contrast NPM-ALK expressing BaF3 cells (named BaF3-NPM-ALK hereinafter) can proliferate In the absence of IL-3 because they obtain proliferative signal through NPM-ALK kinase. Putative Inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase therefore abolish the growth signal and result in antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity of putative Inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase can however be overcome by addition of IL-3 which provides growth signals through an NPM-ALK independent mechanism. [For an analogous cell system using FLT3 kinase see \nE Weisberg et al. Cancer Cell; 1, 433-443 (2002\n)]. The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula I is determined, briefly, as follows: BaF3-NPM-ALK cells (15,000/microtitre plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtitre plates. The test compounds [dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] are added in a series of concentrations (dilution series) in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1 % (v/v). After the addition, the plates are incubated for two days during which the control cultures without test compound are able to undergo two cell-division cycles. The growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells is measured by means of Yopro™ staining [\nT ldziorek et al. J. Immunol. Methods; 185: 249-258 (1995\n)]: 25 µl of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0, 26.8 mM sodium chloride, 0.4 % NP40, 20 mM EDTA and 20 mM is added to each well. Cell lysis is completed within 60 min at room temperature and total amount of Yopro bound to DNA is determined by measurement using the Cytofluor II 96-well reader (PerSeptive Biosystems) with the following settings: Excitation (nm) 485/20 and Emission (nm) 530/25.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50\n values are determined by a computer-aided system using the formula: \n \n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \nABS\n \ntest\n \n \n-\n \n \nABS\n \nstart\n \n \n \n/\n \n \n \nABS\n \ncontrol\n \n \n-\n \n \nABS\n \nstart\n \n \n \n \n×\n \n100.\n \n \n \n \nABS\n \n=\n \nabsorption\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC\n50\n value in those experiments is given as that concentration of the test compound in question that results in a cell count that is 50 % lower than that obtained using the control without inhibitor. The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC\n50\n in the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antiproliferative action of the compounds of formula I can also be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) [described in \nWG Dirks et al. Int. J. Cancer 100, 49-56 (2002\n)] using the same methodology described above for the BaF3-NPM-ALK cell line. The compounds of formula I exhibit Inhibitory activity with an IC\n50\n in the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe action of the compounds of formula I on autophosphorylation of the ALK can be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line by means of an immunoblot as described in \nWG Dirks et al. Int. J. Cancer 100, 49-56 (2002\n). In that test the compounds of formula I exhibit an IC\n50\n of approximately from 0.001 to 1 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds of formula 1, 2-[5-chloro-2-(2-methoxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-ylamino]-N-methyl-benzamide is an especially potent ALK inhibitor, in that this compound inhibits the growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells with an IC\n50\n of 97 nM. Further specifically preferred compounds that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the compounds described hereinafter in the examples 7A and 7B, as well as 7-2, 7-15, 7-36, 7-39, 7-44 and 7-52, respectively, all of which are having an IC\n50\n within the range from <0.5 to 200 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the above uses in the treatment of neoplastic diseases and immune system disorders the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 2000 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent may be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms for oral administration contain, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active substance. Topical administration is e.g. to the skin. A further form of topical administration is to the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreference is given to the use of solutions of the active ingredient, and also suspensions or dispersions, especially isotonic aqueous solutions, dispersions or suspensions which, for example in the case of lyophilized compositions comprising the active ingredient alone or together with a carrier, for example mannitol, can be made up before use. The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilized and/or may comprise excipients, for example preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilizers, salts for regulating osmotic pressure and/or buffers and are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional dissolving and lyophilizing processes. The said solutions or suspensions may comprise viscosity-increasing agents, typically sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or gelatins, or also solubilizers, e.g. Tween 80\n®\n (polyoxyethylene(20)sorbitan mono-oleate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions in oil comprise as the oil component the vegetable, synthetic, or semi-synthetic oils customary for injection purposes. In respect of such, special mention may be made of liquid fatty acid esters that contain as the acid component a long-chained fatty acid having from 8 to 22, especially from 12 to 22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, brassidic acid or linoleic acid, if desired with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, β-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. The alcohol component of these fatty acid esters has a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and is a monovalent or polyvalent, for example a mono-, di- or trivalent, alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or pentanol or the Isomers thereof, but especially glycol and glycerol. As fatty acid esters, therefore, the following are mentioned: ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, \"Labrafil M 2375\" (polyoxyethylene glycerol), \"Labrafil M 1944 CS\" (unsaturated polyglycolized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of apricot kernel oil and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester), \"Labrasol\" (saturated polyglycolized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of TCM and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester; all available from Gattefossé, France), and/or \"Miglyol 812\" (triglyceride of saturated fatty acids of chain length C\n8\n to C\n12\n from Huts AG, Germany), but especially vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and more especially groundnut oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe manufacture of injectable preparations is usually carried out under sterile conditions, as is the filling, for example, into ampoules or vials, and the sealing of the containers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained, for example, by combining the active ingredient with one or more solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, by the inclusion of additional excipients, to form tablets or tablet cores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations, and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and also binders, such as starches, for example com, wheat, rice or potato starch, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or, If desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Additional excipients are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol, or derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablet cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings through the use of, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes or pigments may be added to the tablets or tablet coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration also include hard capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft, sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as corn starch, binders, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquid excipients, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols or fatty acid esters of ethylene or propylene glycol, to which stabilizers and detergents, for example of the polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester type, may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient and a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example of a water-soluble salt, or aqueous injection suspensions that contain viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, if desired, stabilizers, are especially suitable. The active ingredient, optionally together with excipients, can also be in the form of a lyophilizate and can be made into a solution before parenteral administration by the addition of suitable solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions such as are used, for example, for parenteral administration can also be employed as infusion solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred preservatives are, for example, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, or microbicides, such as sorbic acid or benzoic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered as the sole active ingredient or together with other drugs useful against neoplastic diseases or useful in immunomodulating regimens. For example, the agents of the invention may be used in accordance with the invention in combination with pharmaceutical compositions effective in various diseases as described above, e.g. with

Purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human FAK kinase domain is diluted with dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 in water) to a concentration of 94 ng/mL (2.5 nM). The reaction mixture is prepared by mixing 10 µL 5x kinase buffer (250 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 µM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 50 mM MnCl\n2\n, 0.05% BSA, 0.25% Tween-20 in water), 20 µL water, 5 µL of 4 µM biotinylated peptide substrate (Biot-Y397) in aqueous solution, 5 µL of test compound in DMSO, and 5 µL of recombinant enzyme solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The enzyme reaction is started by addition of 5 µL of 5 µM ATP in water and the mixture is Incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. The reaction is terminated by addition of 200 µL of detection mixture (1 nM Eu-PT66, 2.5 µg/mL SA-(SL)APC, 6.25 mM EDTA in dilution buffer), and the FRET signal from europium to allophycocyanin is measured by ARVOsx+L (Perkin Elmer) after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. The ratio of fluorescence intensity of 665 nm to 615 nm is used as a FRET signal for data analysis in order to cancel the colour quenching effect by a test compound. The results are shown as percent inhibition of enzyme activity. DMSO and 0.5 M EDTA are used as a control of 0% and 100% inhibition, respectively. IC\n50\n values are determined by non-linear curve fit analysis using the OriginPro 6.1 program (OriginLab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Blot-Y397 peptide (Biotin-SETDDYAEIID ammonium salt) is designed to have the same amino acid sequence as the region from S392 to D402 of human (GenBank Accession Number L13616) and is prepared by standard methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human FAK kinase domain is obtained in the following way: Full-length human FAK cDNA is isolated by PCR amplification from human placenta Marathon-Ready\n™\n cDNA (Clontech, No. 7411-1) with the 5' PCR primer (ATGGCAGCTGCTTACCTTGAC) and the 3' PCR primer (TCAGTGTGGTCTCGTCTGCCC) and subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, No. A3600). After digestion with Acclll, the purified DNA fragment is treated with Klenow fragment. The cDNA fragment is digested with BamHI and cloned into pFastBacHTb plasmid (Invitrogen Japan K.K., Tokyo) previously cut with BamHI and Stu I. The resultant plasmid, hFAK KD (M384-G706)/pFastBacHTb, is sequenced to confirm its structure. The resulting DNA encodes a 364 amino acid protein containing a hexahistidine tag, a spacer region and a rTEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminal and the kinase domain of FAK (Met384-Gly7O6) from position 29 to 351.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDonor plasmid is transposed into the baculovirus genome, using MaxEfficacy DH10Bac \nE.coli\n cells. Bacmid DNA is prepared by a simple alkaline lysis protocol described in the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression system (Invitrogen). Sf9 insect cells are transfected based on the protocol provided by the vendor (CeIIFECTIN®, Invitrogen). The expression of FAK in each lysate is analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-human FAK monoclonal antibody (clone #77 from Transduction Laboratories).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe virus clone that shows the highest expression is further amplified by infection to Sf9 cells. Expression in ExpresSF+® cells (Protein Sciences Corp., Meriden, Connecticut, USA) gives high level of protein with little degradation. Cell lysates are loaded onto a column of HiTrap\n™\n Chelating Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel sulfate and equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. Captured protein is eluted with increasing amounts of imidazole in HEPES buffer / NaCl, and further purified by dialysis in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 54: Cell-free ZAP-70 Kinase assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ZAP-70 kinase assay is based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). 80 nM ZAP-70 are incubated with 80 nM Lck (lymphoid T-cell protein tyrosine kinase) and 4 µM ATP in ZAP-70 kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 µM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MnCl\n2\n, 0.01 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature in a siliconized polypropylene tube. Then, the selective Lck inhibitor PP2 (1-tert-butyl-3-(4-chloro-phenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine; Alexis Biochemicals) is added (final concentration 1.2 µM) and incubated for further 10 min. 10 µL of this solution is mixed with the 10 µL biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (1 µM) as substrate and 20 µL of serial dilutions of inhibitors and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The kinase reaction is terminated with 10 µL of a 10 mM EDTA solution in detection buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween-20). 50 µL europium-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu-PT66; final concentration 0.125 nM); and 50 µL streptavidin-allophycocyanine (SA-APC; final concentration 40 nM) in detection buffer are added. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature fluorescence is measured on the Victor2 Multilabel Counter (Wallac) at 665 nm. Background values (low control) are obtained in the absence of test samples and ATP and are subtracted from all values. Signals obtained in the absence of test samples are taken as 100% (high control). The inhibition obtained in the presence of test compounds is calculated as percent inhibition of the high control. The concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% inhibition (IC\n50\n) is determined from the dose-response curves. In this assay, the agents of the invention have IC\n50\n values In the range of 10 nM to 2 µM, preferably from 10 nM to 100 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant ZAP-70 kinase is obtained as follows: A nucleic acid encoding full-length human ZAP-70 (GenBank #L05148) is amplified from a Jurkat cDNA library by RT-PCR and cloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, California, USA). The authenticity of the ZAP-70 cDNA insert is validated by complete sequence analysis. This donor plasmid is then used to construct a recombinant baculovirus transfer vector based on the plasmid pVL1392 (Pharmingen, California, USA) featuring in addition an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Following co-transfection with AcNPV viral DNA, 10 independent viral isolates are derived via plaque-purification, amplified on small scale and subsequently analyzed for recombinant ZAP-70 expression by Western Blot using a commercially available anti-ZAP-70 antibody (Clone 2F3.1, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). Upon further amplification of one positive recombinant plaque, titrated virus stocks are prepared and used for infection of Sf9 cells grown in serum-free SF900 II medium (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) under defined, optimized conditions. ZAP-70 protein is isolated from the lysate of infected Sf9 cells by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTAcolumn (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland).\n\n\n \nRecombinant His-tagged ZAP-70 is also available from PanVera LLC, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.\n\n\n \n \n \nLAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell): The biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (Biotin-EEGAPDYENLQELN) used as a substrate in the ZAP-70 kinase assay is prepared in analogy to known methods of peptide synthesis. The N-α Fmoc group of Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-oxymethyl-4-phenoxymethyl-co(polystyrene-1%-divinyl-benzene), content of Asn approx. 0.5 mmol/g, is cleaved using piperidine, 20% in DMF. Four equivalents per amino-group of Fmoc-amino acid protected in their side chains [Asp(OtBu), Glu(OtBu), Asn(Trt), Gln(Trt) and Tyr(tBu)] are coupled using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF. After complete assembly of the peptide chain the terminal Fmoc-protecting group is removed with piperidine in DMF as before. L(+)-biotinyl-aminohexanoic acid is then coupled to the terminal amino group using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF using four equivalents of the reagents for four days at RT. The peptide is cleaved from the resin support and all side-chain protecting groups are simultaneously removed by using a reagent consisting of 5% dodecylmethylsulfide and 5% water in TFA for two hours at RT. Resin particles are filtered off, washed with TFA and the product is precipitated from the combined filtrates by the addition of 10 to 20 volumes of diethyl ether, washed with ether and dried. The product is purified by chromatography on a C-18 wide-pore silica column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 2% aqueous phosphoric acid. Fractions containing the pure compound are collected, filtered through an anion-exchange resin (Biorad, AG4-X4 acetate form) and lyophilized to give the title compound.

Mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells (1 x 10\n5\n) are plated in wells of 96-well culture plates and Incubated with or without various concentrations of inhibitors for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 0.5% BSA. The medium is removed and cells are lysed In 200 µL 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1 mM NaF, 1 µg/mL aprotinin, 1 µg/mL leupeptin and 1 µg/mL pepstatin. After centrifugation, the supernatants are subjected to a sandwich ELISA to quantify the phosphorylated FAK and total FAK. Cell lysates are applied to 96-well flat-bottom ELISA plates which have been pre-coated with 100 µL/well of 4 µg/mL mouse monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (clone 77, Becton Dickinson Transduction Laboratories) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 150 mM NaCl for 18 h at 4°C and blocked with 300 µL of BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals Co.) diluted at 1:4 with H\n2\nO at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with TBSN (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS and 0.05% NP-40), total FAK is detected with 100 µL of 1 µg/ml anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (#65-6140, Upstate Biology Inc.), and phosphorylated FAK is detected with 100 µL of 0.25 µg/µL anti-phosphorylated FAK (Y397) antibody (Affinity BioReagents, #OPA1-03071) in BlockAce diluted at 1:10 with H\n2\nO. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, plates are washed with TBSN and 100 µL of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (#65-6140, Zymed Laboratolies Inc.) diluted at 1:2000 with BlockAce diluted at 1:10 with H\n2\nO is incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBSN, ABTS solution substrate kit (#00-2011, Zymed Lobolatories Inc.) is used for color development. Absorbance at 405 nm is measured after 20 min incubation at room temparature. The concentration of compound causing 50% reduction of phosphorylation level of FAK is determined.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 56: Anchorage-independent tumor cell growth assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells (5 x 10\n3\n) are plated in 96-well Ultra low Attachment plates (#3474, Corning Inc.) in 100 µL of Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% FBS. Cells are cultured for 2 h and inhibitors are added at various concentrations in a final concentration of 0.1 % DMSO. After 48 h, cell growth is assayed with the cell counting kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemical), which uses a water soluble tetrazolium salt WST8. Twenty µL of the reagent is added into each well and cells are further cultured for 2 h. The optical density is measured at 450 nm. The concentration of compound causing 50 % inhibition of growth Is determined.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 57: In vitro T cell migration assay:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibitory activities of FAK inhibitors on the mobility of immune cells are secured by the following in vitro study. That is, Jurkat T human leukemic cell line are placed at 1 x 10\n5\n cells in the upper chamber of Fluoroblok with 8 µm pores (Beckton Dickinson, UK), and are allowed to migrate by four hours cultivation at 37°C, in 95% air-5% CO\n2\n depending on a concentration gradient of fetal bovine serum (10% FBS). Cell mobility is appraised through the number of cells migrated into lower chamber by labeling with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Netherlands) at 8 µg/ml in HBSS for 1 h. For evaluation of FAK inhibitors, both the upper and lower chambers are added with various concentrations of FAK inhibitors (0.03 - 1 µM). IC50 values are calculated by the decrement of those fluorescent intensity compared to that In vehicle-treated group measured with Ascent (Ex: 485 nm, Em: 538 nm).\n\n\n \n \nExample 58:\n Test for activity against IGF-I induced IGF-IR autophosphorylation using the cellular \"Capture ELISA\" test\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assay is conducted as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the assay NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts transfected with human IGF-IR cDNA (complete human IGF-IR cDNA: GenBank Acc. No. NM_000875), prepared as described in \nKato et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2655-61, 1993\n, are used. The cells which overexpress human IGF-IR are cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential (DMEM) medium, containing 10 % Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). For the assay 5,000 cells/well are plated on day 1 on 96-well plates (Costar #3595) in normal growth medium and incubated for 2 days at 37°C in a standard CO\n2\n cell incubator. The density of the cells does not exceed 70-80 % at day 3. On day 3 the medium is discarded and the cells are incubated for 24 h in minimal medium (DMEM, containing 0.5 % FCS). Compounds of formula I [starting from 10 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stock solutions] are added to produce final concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 µM to determine the IC\n50\n value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells are incubated for 90 min in the presence of a compound of formula I. Thereafter the cells are stimulated with 50 µl IGF-I (final concentration of IGF-I in the well = 10 ng/ml; IGF-I is obtained from Sigma; Product Code: I 3769) and incubated for 10 min at 37°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe medium is discarded and the cells are washed twice with PBS/O (=Phosphate-Buffered Saline without CaCl\n2\n) and lysed for 15 min on ice with 50 µl/well RIPA-buffer [50 mM Tris•HCl, pH=7.2, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM benzamidine, 15 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 0.5 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n] and shaken for 10 min using a 96-well plate shaker (=cellular extracts).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPackard HTRF-96 black plates are coated with 50 µl IGF-IR monoclonal Antibody (mAB) (Santa Cruz; Cat. No.: SC-462) in a concentration of 5 µg/ml at 4°C overnight. The plates are washed twice with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and once with nanopure H\n2\nO. Blocking is done for 2 h at room temperature (RT) with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris•HCl, pH=7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween-20). After blocking, the plates are washed once with nanopure H\n2\nO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCellular extracts (40 µ/well) are pipetted onto the precoated Packard plates, together with 40 µl of the anti-phosphotyrosine mouse mAB PY-20 conjugated with Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) (1:1000 diluted in RIPA buffer; the antibody is obtained from Transduction Labs; Cat. No.: P11120).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter incubating the extracts and the secondary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, the extracts are discarded, the plates are washed twice with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS and once with nanopure water. 90 µl/well AP substrate (CDP-Star; obtained from Tropix; Cat. No.: MS100RY) are then added and the plates are Incubated for 45 min at RT in the dark, followed by measuring AP activity in a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter. The IC\n50\n values for the compounds of formula I are calculated via linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Instat program (GraphPad Software, USA). IC\n50\n values in the range of 5 nM to 1 µM, especially in the range of 5 nM to 300 nM are found.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 59 \nin vivo\n activity in the nude mouse xenograft model: female or male BALB/c nude mice (5-8 weeks old, Charles River Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) are kept under sterile conditions with water and feed \nad libitum\n. Tumours are induced by subcutaneous injection of tumour cells (human epithelial cell line MIA PaCa-2; European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK, Catalogue Number 85062806; cell line from a 65 year old Caucasian male; undifferentiated human pancreatic carcinoma cell line) into left or right flank of mice under Forene\n®\n anaesthesia (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Treatment with the test compound is started when the mean tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm\n3\n. Tumour growth is measured two times per week and 1 day after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpendicular axis. The tumour volumes are calculated in accordance with published methods (see Evans et al., Brit. J. Cancer \n45\n, 466-8, 1982). The anti-tumour efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumour volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tumour volume of the untreated animals (controls) and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as delta T/C [%]. Tumour regression is reported as the mean changes of tumor volume of the treated animals divided by the mean tumor volume at start of treatment and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as regression [%]. The test compound is orally administered daily with or without drug holidays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an alternative to cell line MIA PaCa-2, another cell line may also be used in the same manner, for example:\n\n \n \n \nthe 4T1 breast carcinoma cell line (ATCC Number CRL-2539; see also Cancer. 88(12 Supple), 2979-2988, 2000) with female BALB/c mice (injection into mammary fat pad).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nOn the basis of these studies, a compound of formula I according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against proliferative diseases responsive to an inhibition of a tyrosine kinase.\n\n\n \n \nExample 60\n: Tablets\n\n\n \n \n \nTablets comprising 50 mg of active ingredient, for example one of the compounds of formula I described in Examples 1 to 131, and having the following composition are prepared in customary manner:\n\n\n \n\n\nComposition:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n50 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwheat starch\n\n\n150 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlactose\n\n\n125 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolloidal silicic acid\n\n\n12.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntalc\n\n\n22.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmagnesium stearate\n\n\n2.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal:\n\n\n362.5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPreparation\n: The active ingredient is mixed with a portion of the wheat starch, with the lactose and the colloidal silicic acid and the mixture is forced through a sieve. A further portion of the wheat starch is made into a paste, on a water bath, with five times the amount of water and the powder mixture is kneaded with the paste until a slightly plastic mass is obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plastic mass is pressed through a sieve of about 3 mm mesh size and dried, and the resulting dry granules are again forced through a sieve. Then the remainder of the wheat starch, the talc and the magnesium stearate are mixed in and the mixture is compressed to form tablets weighing 145 mg and having a breaking notch.\n\n\n \n \nExample
