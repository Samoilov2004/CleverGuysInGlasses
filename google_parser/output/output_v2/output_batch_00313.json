Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIntracellular receptors (IR's) are a class of structurally related proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The steroid hormone receptors are a subset of this superfamily whose natural ligands are typically comprised of endogenous steroids such as estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. Man-made ligands to these receptors play an important role in human health and, of these receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor has an essential role in regulating human physiology and immune response. Steroids that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor have been shown to be potent anti-inflammatory agents, although cross-reactivity with other steroid hormone receptors such as the mineralocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors can lead to problematic ancillary pharmacology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dissociation of transactivation from transrepression at the glucocorticoid receptor is believed to be an approach toward improving the side-effect profile related to steroid therapy. The beneficial anti-inflammatory activity of GR modulators, such as steroids, is believed to occur through the transrepression of genes encoding for proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and enzymes. Many of the undesireable side-effects associated with such agents are believed to occur through the transactivation, or induction, of gene transcription leading to the downstream perturbation of homeostatic endocrine function. Some of these affected metabolic processes include induced gluconeogenesis, induced amino acid degradation, osteoporosis, suppression of HPA axis, induction of secondary adrenal suppression, changes in electrolyte concentration, changes in lipid metabolism, growth retardation, impaired wound healing and skin thinning. Weak, partial and full agonism of GR related to transrepression and transactivation, including potential antagonism of the receptor regarding transactivation, may be applied to the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.

An object of the invention is the discovery of novel compounds that modulate the glucocoricoid receptor. Another object of the invention is the discovery of novel glucocorticoid receptor modulators with superior transactivation and transrepression activity profiles. It is believed that such compounds would have potent ani-inflammatory and immunosupresive activity and possess advantages over current steroid therapies with respect to side effects, efficacy, toxicity and/or metabolism.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to 2-[1-phenyl-5-hydroxy-4alpha-methyl-hexahydrocyclopenta[\nf\n]indazol-5-yl]ethyl phenyl derivatives as glucocorticoid receptor ligands useful for treating a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the \n \nU.S. Patent 4,256,108\n \n; \n \n4,166,452\n \n; and \n \n4,265,874\n \n to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of the invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)

The solution is then cooled to 7°C and oxalyl chloride is added dropwise over 30 min at < 15°C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is warmed to rt and aged for 45 min. Upon complete consumption of the acid, the reaction mixture is then charged dropwise into another flask containing cold (9 °C) mixture of concentrated NH\n4\nOH and 2-Me-THF over 1.5 h, while maintaining the temperature around 20-25°C. To the reaction mixture is added water (100 mL) to dissolve some solids and the resulting biphasic layer is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and the organic layer is washed with 1 N HCl (50 mL) and with brine (100 mL). The final organic layer is then solvent switched to toluene to give a final slurry concentration of 15 vol. The slurry is then hheated to 110°C to get a clear solution, which is then cooled slowly to RT. Crystallization is typically observed to occur at 100°C and after aging at rt overnight, heptane (10 vol) is then added, followed by a 1h of age. The suspension is then filtered and the wet cake is washed with cold 1:1 heptane:toluene and dried under a stream of N\n2\n to give the product in 46.9 g (94.7%).\n\n\n \n\n\n6.

The slurry is then diluted with THF (8 vol) and the resulting solution is filtered through Solka Floc (75wt%) and rinsed with more THF (10 vol). The combined filtrate is filtered through a 1 micron inline filter into a round bottom flask and treated with 20wt% Ecosorb C941 and 5wt% MP-TMT and aged with rigorous stirring at 25°C for 6 hours. The slurry is then filtered through 50wt% SiO\n2\n gel, rinsed with 10 vol of THF and the combined filtrate is then solvent switched to MeCN to give a final slurry concentration of 13 vol. The slurry is then heated to 75°C, at which a clear yellowish solution is obtained, cooled to 72°C, seeded with 4% seeds and allowed to cool to 30°C over 5-8 hours and aged for additional 8 hours. Water (8 vol) is then added over 3 hours, while maintaining the temperature between 28-30°C. At the end of addition, the resulting slurry is allowed to cool to 4°C over 1-2h, aged for additional 1h, filtered and the wet cake is washed with cold 1:1 mixture of MeCN:H\n2\nO. After drying at rt under a stream of N\n2\n, 4.25 g of the product is isolated as white solid (87% yield).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF 2-(2-(2-[(4α\nS\n,5\nR\n)-1-(4-FLUOROPHENYL)-5-HYDROXY-4α-METHYL-1,4,4α,5,6,7-HEXAHYDROCYCLOPENTA(\nF\n)INDAZOL-5-YL]ETHYL)PHENYL)-2-HYDROXYACETAMIDE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMethyl(2-bromophenyl)hydroxy acetate (192-2)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of 2 M trimethylsiylydiazomethane in diethyl ether (108 ml, 216 mmol) was added to a stirred, cooled 0 °C solution of \n192-1\n (25 g, 108 mmol) in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (250 mL) and MeOH (50 ml) and the solution was stirred for 60 minutes.

The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution).\n\n\n \n\n\nPreparation of HeLa Cell Lysate\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen the cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The cell pellet is washed twice with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of 107 cells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to -80°C freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (∼1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 µL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 µL of the TEGM buffer.\n\n\n \n\n\nProcedure for Multiple Compound Screening\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n1x TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction), 3H-DEX (Amersham Biosciences) and 1x TEGM. [e.g. For 100 samples, 200 µL (100 x 2) of EtOH + 4.25 µL of 1:10 3H-Dex stock + 2300 µL (100 x 23) 1x TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final conc. is 1 µM, and the compound is in 25 µL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 µL of 4x1 µM solution is made and 3 µL of 100 µM is added to 72 µL of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n25µL of \n3\nH-DEX (6 nM) trace and 25 µL compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 µL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4°C overnight. 100 µL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate™ Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 µL of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillint for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCount microscintillation counter (Packard). IC\n50\ns are calculated using DEX as a reference.\n\n\n \n\n\nTrans-Activation Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GRAMMER)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the MMTV-LUC reporter gene in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or HeLa cells, a human breast cancer cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures induction of a modified MMTV LTR/promoter linked to the LUC reporter gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe routine transient assay consists of plating 7,000-25,000 cells/well of a white, clear-bottom 96-well plate. Alternatively, 384-well plates can be used at a cell concentration of 10,000 /well. The media that the cells are plated in is \"exponential growth medium\" which consists of phenol red-free RPMI1640 containing 10%FBS, 4mM L-glutamine, 20mM HEPES, 10ug/mL human insulin, and 20ug/mL gentamicin. Incubator conditions are 37°C and 5% CO\n2\n. The transfection is done in batch mode. The cells are trypsinized and counted to the right cell number in the proper amount of fresh media. It is then gently mixed with the FuGene6/DNA mix and plated onto the 96 or 384-well plate, all the wells receive 100 uL or 40uL, respectively, of medium + lipid/DNA complex then incubated 37°C overnight. The transfection cocktail consists of serum-free OptiMEM, FuGene6 reagent and DNA. The manufacturer's (Roche Biochemical) protocol for cocktail setup is as follows: The lipid to DNA ratio is approximately 2.5:1 and the incubation time is 20 min at room temperature. Sixteen to 24 hours after transfection, the cells are treated with dexamethasone to a final concentration of 10nM as well as the compound of interest, such that final DMSO (vehicle) concentration is equal to or less than 1%. Each plate also contains samples that are treated with 10nM dexamethasone alone, which is used as the 100% activity control. The cells are exposed to the compounds for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells are lysed by a Promega cell culture lysis buffer for approximately 30 min and then the luciferase activity in the extracts is assayed in the 96-well format luminometer. In 384-well format, Steady-Glo (Promega) or Steady-Lite (PerkinElmer) can be used by adding an equal volume of reagent to the media present in each well. Activity induced by 10nM dexamethasone alone is set at 100% activity. Antagonist activity is calculated by determining the decrease in dexamethasone-induced activity in response to compound treatment relative to samples that were treated with dexamethasone alone. Results are expressed as % inhibition of 10nM dexamethasone activity or as fold of 10nM dexamethasone activity. This transactivation assay can be performed in an agonist and antagonist mode to identify these different activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax\n relative to the activity obtained with 300 nM dexamethasone. Activity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax\n relative to the activity obtained with 300 nM DEX. The exemplified tissue selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators of the present invention display agonist activity in this assay of greater than 5% and less than 100%, and maximal transactivation activity less then maximal transrepression activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe action of compounds is also tested in an antagonist mode (Anti-GRAMMER) in which the cells are treated with medium containing an agonist such as 10 nM DEX and the ability of agents to inhibit the activation by an agonist is measured.\n\n\n \n\n\nTransrepression assay (GITAR)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the TNFα-β-lactamase reporter gene in U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures compound dependent-repression of the TNFa promoter linked to a reporter gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human U937cells that had been stablely transfected with the TNF-α promoter driving β-lactamase are used for this assay. U937 cells contain an endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 Growth medium (Gibco Cat# 11875-093) containing 25mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2mM L-Glutamine,1mM Sodium pyruvate, 25µg/ml Gentamicin (Gibco Cat#15710-064), 1:1000 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco Cat#21985-023) and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Gibco Cat#10131-027). The density of the cells in the flask needs to be about 1X106 - 3X106/ml at the time of harvest. Usually, the cells are split to 1.2∼1.4x105 /ml (1:10) 3 days prior to the assay. 50,000 cells/well are plated in 96 well black-walled plates the day of assay. Test compounds are added 10 µL/well, and cells are incubated at 37oC for 30∼45 min. For assaying compounds, first dilute 1:10 in DMSO to make 1 mM, then further dilute 1:100 in medium to make 10X stock prior to adding to the cells. Add 50ng/ml PMA (Sigma, cat# P8139) 10 µL/well to a final concentration 5ng/ml, and 1 µg/ml LPS (Sigma, cat# L4130) 10 µL/well to a final concentration 100ng/ml. Incubate cells at 370C overnight for ∼18hr. PMA is stored frozen as 100 µg/ml stock in DMSO. Dilute 1:10 in DMSO for a working stock of 10 µg/ml and store at -20C. For assaying, dilute the 10 µg/ml working stock 1:200 in medium to make a 10X solution (50 ng/ml). Store frozen LPS at 1 mg/ml in PBS, dilute 1:1000 in medium to make 10X (1 µg/ml) for the assay. Add 6X loading buffer (CCF2-AM) 20 µL/well, and incubate at room temperature for 70∼90 min. Read plates on CytoFluor II Plate Reader according to manufacture suggested protocols. The activity repressed by 100nM dexamethasone alone is set as 100% activity.\n\n\n \n\n\nMicroarray analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to modulate the transcription of endogenously expressed genes in a variety of cell types including but not limited to A549, HeLa or U937 cells. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Life Tech, Carlsbad CA. A549 cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37oC with 5% CO2. Using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Corp, Valencia CA.), total RNA was extracted and purified from A549 cells treated with different GC compounds for 24 hours, at a fully active dose. These cells express large amount of the GR and are very responsive to GC treatment. All samples were compared against cells treated with vehicle. Expression levels of 23000 genes were measured using oligonucleotide microarrays purchased from Agilent Technologies, Inc. Each comparison was done on a pair of microarrays with reversed fluorophores. Raw image intensity data were processed according to the method described in Patent \n \n6,351,712\n \n. The method was used to remove dye bias and to derive a Rosetta probability (p) and fold change value for each gene and each sample pair. Furthermore, for each gene an ANOVA model was constructed across all treatments to derive error estimates. P values for evaluating expression differences were computed using a Bayesian adjusted t-test that was developed by Lönnstedt and Speed (2002) and extended by Smyth (2003). A gene was declared differentially expressed in any particular comparison if it satisfied two critera:\n\n \n \n \n1. The Rosetta p value had to be less than 0.1 and the Rosetta fold change value had to be greater than 1.4 in at least one of the treatments.\n \n2. The ANOVA p value had to be less than 0.01 and the fold change greater than 2 in the comparison under consideration.\n \n\n\n\n\nIn Vivo inflammation Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIntact adult (6 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats are used in the oxazolone (OX) contactdermatitis model. Rats were sensitized on the ventral abdomen with OX on Day 0. On Days 7 and 9, a randomly-selected ear was challenged (same ear each time) with OX; the other was treated with vehicle. Daily treatment begun on Day 7 and continued for 7d with test compounds at different doses and 1.3 mpk 6-methlyprednisolone or 0.1 mpk DEX as positive controls. The thickness of both ears are measured on Days 11 and 14. Necropsy occurred on Day 14. The rat is first weighed, then anesthetized in a CO\n2\n chamber until near death.\n\nApproximately 5ml whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain signs of death and completeness. Tissues are dissected in a highly stylized fashion. The the following endpoints were evaluated: a) inhibiting ear inflammation induced by oxazalone, b) raising serum insulin, c) reducing serum ACTH, d) reducing spleen weight, e) reducing skin thickness, f) reducing body weight, g) increasing expression of bone-related genes with potential relationship to negative glucocorticoid effects on bone; e) changes in molecular markers that correlate with skin inflammation, skin thinning, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver. All blood samples were collected between 1330-1530 hours, ∼4-5 hrs after the last compound treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary data for this assay are left and right ear thickness. Inter-ear thickness difference (etd) is used for the estimating the level of inflammation and effectiveness of the compounds is determined by their ability to reduce the increase the thickness of the inflamed ear. Back of the rat skin thickness, spleen weight, serum insulin as well as the effects of gcs on the expression of molecular markers in skin inflammation, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver are measured. Data are analyzed by anova plus fisher plsd post-hoc test to identify intergroup differences.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds shown in Table 1 were tested in the binding, GRAMMER and GITAR assays and demonstrated a superior activity profile. The compounds shown in Table 1 have potencies in the GRAMMER and GITAR assays (as measured by inflection points, IP) of less than 300nM concomitant with maximum activity in the GRAMMER assay of less than 60% and maximum activity in the GITAR assay of between 40 and 80%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds in the range of activities described above offer potential improvements over fuller agonists (higher Emaxes) as they may have less side effects as demonstrated in preclinical models. Among the compounds with the described range of activities, different selectivity profiles may be observed in different animal models, which model the side effects of diabetes and glucose intolerance, skin and muscle atrophy, intraocular pressure, bone degradation, and hypertension. Compounds shown in Table 1 have demonstrated, or have the potential for such selectivity.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTransactivation A549 Cells\n \nTransrepression U937 Cells\n \nGITAR >\n \n \n \nExample\n \nGR BIND\n \nGRAMMER\n \nGITAR\n \nGRAMM\n \n \n \n \n \nKi (nM)\n \nIp (nM)\n \nEmax (%)\n \nIP (nM)\n \nEmax (%)\n \n% SEP\n \n \n \n \n2\n \n2.08\n \n39\n \n51\n \n88\n \n65\n \n14\n \n \n \n5\n \n0.44\n \n138\n \n40\n \n179\n \n64\n \n24\n \n \n \n11\n \n2.37\n \n290\n \n39\n \n208\n \n57\n \n17\n \n \n \n14\n \n6.38\n \n175\n \n55\n \n193\n \n79\n \n23\n \n \n \n15\n \n1.17\n \n236\n \n43\n \n242\n \n79\n \n36\n \n \n \n23\n \n5.09\n \n268\n \n36\n \n263\n \n73\n \n37\n \n \n \n26\n \n1.37\n \n39\n \n24\n \n123\n \n39\n \n15\n \n \n \n28\n \n3.55\n \n48\n \n28\n \n65\n \n72\n \n43\n \n \n \n29\n \n1.14\n \n95\n \n24\n \n190\n \n61\n \n37\n \n \n \n30\n \n1.52\n \n81\n \n29\n \n127\n \n50\n \n21\n \n \n \n31\n \n0.90\n \n93\n \n9\n \n183\n \n48\n \n39\n \n \n \n32\n \n0.49\n \n134\n \n13\n \n277\n \n49\n \n36\n \n \n \n33\n \n1.13\n \n62\n \n37\n \n123\n \n62\n \n25\n \n \n \n34\n \n5.29\n \n128\n \n13\n \n208\n \n54\n \n41\n \n \n \n35\n \n3.55\n \n60\n \n48\n \n170\n \n62\n \n14\n \n \n \n38\n \n0.43\n \n91\n \n15\n \n152\n \n58\n \n44\n \n \n \n40\n \n6.14\n \n231\n \n46\n \n246\n \n64\n \n17\n \n \n \n41\n \n0.83\n \n46\n \n18\n \n115\n \n62\n \n44\n \n \n \n42\n \n2.79\n \n74\n \n51\n \n122\n \n64\n \n13\n \n \n \n43\n \n5.16\n \n111\n \n59\n \n98\n \n68\n \n9\n \n \n \n44\n \n0.60\n \n95\n \n24\n \n119\n \n67\n \n43\n \n \n \n45\n \n1.02\n \n183\n \n18\n \n220\n \n70\n \n52\n \n \n \n46\n \n3.02\n \n176\n \n54\n \n248\n \n70\n \n17\n \n \n \n47\n \n11.53\n \n196\n \n59\n \n205\n \n71\n \n12\n \n \n \n48\n \n1.20\n \n94\n \n13\n \n198\n \n72\n \n59\n \n \n \n49\n \n0.81\n \n26\n \n25\n \n30\n \n72\n \n47\n \n \n \n51\n \n7.05\n \n164\n \n30\n \n193\n \n73\n \n42\n \n \n \n52\n \n0.80\n \n21\n \n45\n \n154\n \n74\n \n29\n \n \n \n55\n \n0.92\n \n173\n \n23\n \n187\n \n76\n \n53\n \n \n \n57\n \n0.61\n \n24\n \n37\n \n30\n \n77\n \n40\n \n \n \n59\n \n1.83\n \n108\n \n40\n \n95\n \n77\n \n37\n \n \n \n61\n \n0.58\n \n86\n \n35\n \n83\n \n79\n \n44\n \n \n \n62\n \n9.58\n \n212\n \n23\n \n246\n \n79\n \n56\n \n \n \n83\n \n0.56\n \n70\n \n21\n \n94\n \n54\n \n33\n \n \n \n84\n \n0.62\n \n50\n \n23\n \n96\n \n60\n \n37\n \n \n \n85\n \n0.31\n \n94\n \n19\n \n182\n \n63\n \n44\n \n \n \n86\n \n0.51\n \n211\n \n13\n \n246\n \n66\n \n53\n \n \n \n88\n \n0.57\n \n53\n \n32\n \n90\n \n69\n \n37\n \n \n \n89\n \n0.40\n \n43\n \n20\n \n64\n \n70\n \n50\n \n \n \n91\n \n0.26\n \n121\n \n46\n \n231\n \n72\n \n26\n \n \n \n107\n \n2.32\n \n261\n \n37\n \n217\n \n66\n \n29\n \n \n \n113\n \n2.66\n \n205\n \n32\n \n207\n \n71\n \n39\n \n \n \n114\n \n2.77\n \n221\n \n43\n \n199\n \n78\n \n34\n \n \n \n138\n \n0.84\n \n137\n \n55\n \n212\n \n72\n \n17\n \n \n \n150\n \n11.00\n \n264\n \n38\n \n210\n \n67\n \n29\n \n \n \n156\n \n2.90\n \n278\n \n47\n \n189\n \n69\n \n22\n \n \n \n157\n \n1.50\n \n240\n \n45\n \n194\n \n63\n \n18\n \n \n \n159\n \n2.96\n \n197\n \n37\n \n125\n \n73\n \n36\n \n \n \n160\n \n0.94\n \n118\n \n30\n \n274\n \n72\n \n42\n \n \n \n168\n \n2.16\n \n53\n \n58\n \n52\n \n77\n \n19\n \n \n \n170\n \n2.12\n \n234\n \n24\n \n223\n \n66\n \n42\n \n \n \n172\n \n6.59\n \n162\n \n41\n \n139\n \n78\n \n36\n \n \n \n174\n \n4.76\n \n147\n \n36\n \n183\n \n77\n \n41\n \n \n \n185\n \n1.93\n \n144\n \n39\n \n59\n \n80\n \n41\n \n \n \n189\n \n1.55\n \n28\n \n49\n \n23\n \n80\n \n31\n \n \n \n191\n \n2.51\n \n55\n \n49\n \n33\n \n78\n \n29\n \n \n \n194\n \n1.48\n \n99\n \n38\n \n87\n \n78\n \n41\n \n \n \n196\n \n1.80\n \n253\n \n20\n \n287\n \n40\n \n20\n \n \n \n197\n \n1.41\n \n249\n \n46\n \n138\n \n67\n \n21\n \n \n \n198\n \n2.44\n \n187\n \n29\n \n197\n \n52\n \n23\n \n \n \n199\n \n4.55\n \n83\n \n36\n \n77\n \n68\n \n32\n \n \n \n201\n \n5.62\n \n47\n \n40\n \n40\n \n78\n \n38\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compounds previously described in the patent literature that are the most closely structurally related to the compounds described in Table 1 do not possess the superior activity profile as described above.
