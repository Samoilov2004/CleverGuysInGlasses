Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to the generation and characterization of neutralizing anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibodies with broad reactivity against various IFN-α subtypes. The invention further relates to the use of such anti-IFN-α antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders associated with increased expression of IFN-α, in particular, autoimmune disorders such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterferon-α (IFN-α)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough interferons were initially discovered for their anti-viral activities, subsequent research has unraveled a plethora of regulatory activities associated with these powerful cytokines. Type I interferons form an ancient family of cytokines that includes IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-δ, IFN-ω and IFN-τ (\nRoberts et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 18: 805-816 [1998\n]). They are coded by intronless genes and are widely distributed amongst vertebrates. Whereas IFN-β is coded by a single gene in primates and rodents, more than 10 and 15 different subtypes of IFN-α have been found in mice and man respectively. Other interferons of type I are more restricted, e.g. IFN-δ in the pig, IFN-τ in cattle and sheep, and IFN-ω in cattle and humans. Thus, human type I interferons comprise multiple members of the IFN-α family, and single members of the IFN-β and IFN-ω families. All type I IFNs appear to bind to a single receptor that is comprised of at least two membrane spanning proteins. Type II interferons on the other hand are represented by a single member, IFN-γ, and bind to a distinct receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough all type I IFNs, including IFN-α, exhibit anti-viral and anti-proliferative activities and thereby help to control viral infections and tumors (\nLefevre et al., Biochimie 80: 779-788 [1998\n];\n Horton et al., Cancer Res. 59: 4064-4068 [1999\n]; \nAlexenko et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 17: 769-779 [1997\n];\n Gresser, J. Leukoc. Biol. 61: 567-574 [1997\n]), there are also several autoimmune diseases that are associated with increased expression of IFNα, most notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType I diabetes, also known as autoimmune diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is an autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of pancreatic β cells by autoreactive T lymphocytes (\nBach, Endocr. Rev. 15: 516-542 [1994\n]; \nCastano and Eisenbarth, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 8: 647-679 [1990\n]; \nShehadeh and Lafferty, Diabetes Rev. 1: 141-151 [1993\n]). The pathology of IDDM is very complex involving an interaction between an epigenetic event (possibly a viral infection), the pancreatic β cells and the immune system in a genetically susceptible host. A number of cytokines, including IFN-α and IFN-γ, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IDDM in humans and in animal models of the disease (\nCampbell et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87: 739-742 [1991\n]; \nHuang et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]; \nRhodes and Taylor, Diabetologia 27: 601-603 (1984\n]). For example, pancreatic \nIfn-\nα mRNA expression and the presence of immunoreactive IFN-α in β cells of patients with IDDM have been reported (\nFoulis et al., Lancet 2: 1423-1427 [1987\n]; Huang \net al.,\n [1995] \nsupra;\n \nSomoza et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1360-1377 [1994\n]). IFN-α expression has been associated with hyperexpression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I\nA\n antigens in human islets (Foulis \net al.,\n [1987] \nsupra;\n Somoza \net al.,\n [1994] \nsupra).\n In two rodent models of autoimmune diabetes, the diabetes-prone DP-BB rat and streptozotocin-treated mice, \nIfn-\nα mRNA expression in islets precedes insulitis and diabetes (\nHuang et al., Immunity 1: 469-478 [1994\n]). Furthermore, transgenic mice harboring a hybrid human insulin promoter-Ifn-α construct develop hypoinsulinemic diabetes accompanied by insulitis (\nStewart et al., Science 260: 1942-1946 [1993\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt appears that local expression of IFN-α by pancreatic islet cells in response to potential diabetogenic stimuli such as viruses may trigger the insulitic process. Consistent with its role as an initiating agent, IFN-α has been shown to induce intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA class I\nA\n on endothelial cells from human islets, which may contribute to leukocyte infiltration during insulitis (\nChakrabarti et al., J. Immunol. 157: 522-528 [1996\n]). Furthermore, IFN-α facilitates T cell stimulation by the induction of the co-stimulatory molecules ICAM-1 and B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells in islets (\nChakrabarti et al., Diabetes 45: 1336-1343 [1996\n]). These studies collectively indicate that early IFN-α expression by β cells may be a critical event in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes. Although there are a number of reports implicating IFN-γ in the development of IDDM in rodent models, there is a poor correlation between the expression of this cytokine and human IDDM. Thus, cells expressing IFN-γ can be found in the islets of a subset of human patients selected for significant lymphocytic infiltration into the islets. In a group of patients that were not selected by this criterion there was no obvious association between IFN-γ expression and human IDDM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the increased level of IFN-α expression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IFN-α has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE (\nYtterberg and Schnitzer, Arthritis Rheum. 25: 401-406 [1982\n]; \nShi et al., Br. J. Dermatol. 117: 155-159 [1987\n]). It is interesting to note that IFN-α is currently used for the treatment of cancer as well as viral infection such as chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. Consistent with the observations of increased levels of IFN-α triggering autoimmunity, significant increase in the appearance of autoimmune disorders such as IDDM, SLE and autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in the patients undergoing IFN-α therapy. For example, prolonged use of IFN-α as an anti-viral therapy has been shown to induce IDDM (\nWaguri et al., Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 23: 33-36 [1994\n]; \nFabris et al., J. Hepatol. 28: 514-517 [1998\n]) or SLE (\nGarcia-Porrua et al., Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 16: 107-108 [1998\n]). The treatment of coxsackievirus B (CBV) infection with IFN-α therapy is also associated with the induction of IDDM (\nChehadeh et al., J. Infect. Dis. 181: 1929-1939 [2000\n]). Similarly, there are multiple case reports documenting IDDM or SLE in IFN-α treated cancer patients (\nRonnblom et al., J. Intern. Med. 227: 207-210 [1990\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAntibody therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics has gained increased acceptance with several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) either approved for human use or in late stage clinical trials. The first mAb approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of allograft rejection was anti-CD3 (OKT3) in 1986. Since then the pace of progress in the field of mAbs has been considerably accelerated, particularly from 1994 onwards which led to approval of additional seven mAbs for human treatment. These include ReoPro\n®\n for the management of complications of coronary angioplasty in 1994, Zenapax\n®\n (anti-CD25) for the prevention of allograft rejection in 1997, Rituxan\n®\n (anti-CD20) for the treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1997, Infliximab\n®\n (anti-TNF-α) initially for the treatment of Crohn's disease in 1998 and subsequently for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1999, Simulect\n®\n (anti-CD25) for the prevention of allograft rejection in 1998, Synagis\n®\n (anti-F protein of respiratory syncitial virus) for the treatment of respiratory infections in 1998, and Herceptin\n®\n (anti-HER2/neu) for the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast tumors in 1998 (\nGlennie and Johnson, Immunol. Today 21: 403-410 [2000\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAnti-IFN-\nα \nAntibodies\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDisease states that are amenable to intervention with mAbs include all those in which there is a pathological level of a target antigen. For example, an antibody that neutralizes IFN-α present in the sera of patients with SLE, and expressed by the pancreatic islets in IDDM, is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in these diseases. It could also be used for therapeutic intervention in other autoimmune diseases with underlying increase in and causative role of IFN-α expression. In both human IDDM (\nFoulis, et al., Lancet 2: 1423-1427 [1987\n]; \nHuang, et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]; \nSomoza, et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1360-1377 [1994\n]) and human SLE (\nHooks, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 25: 396-400 [1982\n]; \nKim, et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 70: 562-569 [1987\n]; \nLacki, et al., J. Med. 28: 99-107 [1997\n]; \nRobak, et al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis 46: 375-380 [1998\n]; \nShiozawa, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 35: 417-422 [1992\n]; \nvon Wussow, et al., Rheumatology International 8: 225-230 [1988\n]) there appears to be correlation between disease and IFN-α but not with either IFN-β or IFN-γ. Thus, anti-interferon mAb intervention in IDDM or SLE would require specific neutralization of most, if not all, of the IFN-α subtypes, without any significant neutralization of IFN-β or IFN-γ. Leaving the activity of these last two interferons intact may also have an advantage in allowing the retention of significant anti-viral activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile a few mAbs that show reactivity with a range of recombinant human IFN-α subtypes have been described, these were found to neutralize only a limited subset of the recombinant IFN-α subtypes analyzed or were not capable of neutralizing the mixture of IFN-α subtypes that are produced by stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes (\nTsukui et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 30: 1129-1139 [1986\n]; \nBerg, J. Interferon Res. 4: 481-491 [1984\n]; \nMeager and Berg, J. Interferon Res. 6: 729-736 [1986\n]; \n \nUS Patent No. 4,902,618\n \n; and \n \nEP publication No. 0,139,676 B1\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there is a great need for anti-IFN-α antibodies that not only bind to most, preferably all, subtypes of IFN-α but also neutralize such subtypes while do not interfere with the biological function of other interferons.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the development of a monoclonal antibody that was experimentally found to neutralize all seven of different recombinant human IFN-α subtypes tested and two independent pools of natural human IFN-α subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibody which binds to and neutralizes a biological activity of at least human IFN-α subtypes IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21.

The patient is a mammalian patient, preferably a human patient. The disease is an autoimmune disease, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); or autoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n\n \n\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nFig. 1\n shows a schematic diagram of the strategy used for the development of the anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \nFig. 2\n shows that a murine anti-human IFN-α mAb (9F3) is able to neutralize a spectrum of recombinant IFN-α subtypes but not recombinant IFN-β. The indicated IFN's were assayed for inhibition of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viral growth in A549 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of the mAb 9F3. Data are presented as the percentage of the viral growth inhibition activity obtained with the indicated IFN in the absence of mAb 9F3.\n\n\n \nFigs. 3A-3B\n show the neutralization of leukocyte interferon (Sigma) (\nFig. 3A\n) and lymphoblastoid interferon (NIH reference Ga23-901-532) (\nFig. 3B\n). In \nFig. 3A\n, 20,000 IU/ml (filled bars) or 5,000 IU/ml (open bars) of leukocyte interferon (Sigma Product No. I-2396) were incubated with blank control (buffer only) (denoted as \"-\"), 10 :g/ml control mouse IgG (denoted as \"mIgG\"), or 10 :g/ml mAb 9F3 (denoted as \"9F3\"). Dilutions were assayed and the amount of remaining activity shown. The results shown are means of duplicate determinations. In \nFig. 3B\n, lymphoblastoid interferon (NIH reference Ga23-901-532) was assayed at 10 (filled columns) or 3 (open columns) IU/ml in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of mAb 9F3. A higher cytopathic effect is indicative of a decrease in interferon activity. The results shown are the means of duplicate determinations.\n\n\n \nFig. 4\n depicts results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showing the induction of an ISGF3/ISRE complex by IFN-α and the ability of 9F3 mAb to prevent the formation of the complex. EMSA was performed in the presence or absence of either human IFN-α2 (denoted as \"α2\") or IFN-∃ (denoted as \"3\") at a concentration of 25 ng/ml with 9F3 mAb (denoted as \"9F3\") or murine IgG control antibody (denoted as \"IgG\") at a concentration of 10 :g/ml.\n\n\n \nFig. 5A\n shows the alignment of light chain variable domain amino acid sequences of murine 9F3 (murine, SEQ ID NO: 1), humanized 9F3 version 13 (V13, SEQ ID NO: 3), and the consensus human variable domain light κ subgroup I (huκI, SEQ ID NO: 4). The CDRs (L1, SEQ ID NO: 7; L2, SEQ ID NO: 8; and L3, SEQ ID NO: 9) are highlighted by underlining.

The residue numbering is according to Kabat \net al.\n (1991) \nsupra.\n The differences between the murine 9F3 and V13 sequences and the differences between 9F3 and huIII sequences are indicated by asterisks.\n\n\n \nFig. 6\n shows neutralization activity of the starting mAb 9F3 (left panel) and the chimeric protein CH8-2 (right panel) toward the viral growth inhibition exhibited by recombinant IFN-α subtypes in A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus.\n\n\n \nFig. 7\n depicts a model of humanized 9F3 version 13. Backbone of VL and VH domains is shown as a ribbon. CDRs are shown in white and are labeled (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, H3). Framework side chains altered from human to murine are shown in white and are labeled by residue number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment\n\n\n\n\nA. \nDefinitions\n \n\n\n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. See, e.g. \nSingleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J. Wiley & Sons (New York, NY 1994\n); \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Press (Cold Springs Harbor, NY 1989\n). For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"type I interferon\" is defined to include all subtypes of native sequence type I interferons of any mammalian species, including interferon-α, interferon-β, interferon-δ, interferon-ω and interferon-τ. Similarly, the term \"human type I interferon\" is defined to include all subtypes of native sequence type I human interferons, including human interferon-α, interferon-β and interferon-ω classes and which bind to a common cellular receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise expressly provided, the terms \"interferon-α,\" \"IFN-α,\" and \"human interferon-a\", \"human IFN-α\" and \"hIFN-∀\" are used herein to refer to all species of native sequence human alpha interferons, including all subtypes of native sequence human interferons-α. Natural (native sequence) human interferon-α comprises 23 or more closely related proteins encoded by distinct genes with a high degree of structural homology (\nWeissmann and Weber, Prog. Nucl. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol., 33: 251 [1986\n]; \nJ. Interferon Res., 13: 443-444 [1993\n]; \nRoberts et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 18: 805-816 [1998\n]). The human IFN-α locus comprises two subfamilies. The first subfamily consists of at least 14 functional, non-allelic genes, including genes encoding IFN-αA (IFN-α2), IFN-αB (IFN-α8), IFN-αC (IFN-α10), IFN-αD (IFN-α1), IFN-αE (IFN-α22), IFN-αF (IFN-α21), IFN-αG (IFN-α5), and IFN-αH (IFN-α14), and pseudogenes having at least 80% homology. The second subfamily, α\nII\n or T, contains at least 5 pseudogenes and one functional gene (denoted herein as \"IFN-\nα\n \n \n \nII\n1\" or \"IFN-T\") which exhibits 70% homology with the IFN-α genes (Weissmann and Weber [1986] \nsupra).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"first human interferon-∀ (hIFN-∀) receptor\", \"IFN-∀R\", \"hIFNAR1\", \"IFNAR1\", and \"Uze chain\" are defined as the 557 amino acid receptor protein cloned by \nUze et al., Cell, 60: 225-234 (1990\n), including an extracellular domain of 409 residues, a transmembrane domain of 21 residues, and an intracellular domain of 100 residues, as shown in \nFig. 5\n on page 229 of Uze \net al.\n Also encompassed by the foregoing terms are fragments of IFNAR1 that contain the extracellular domain (ECD) (or fragments of the ECD) of IFNAR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"second human interferon-∀ (hIFN-∀) receptor\", \"IFN-∀∃R\", \"hIFNAR2\", \"IFNAR2\", and \"Novick chain\" are defined as the 515 amino acid receptor protein cloned by \nDomanski et al., J. Biol. Chem., 37: 21606-21611 (1995\n), including an extracellular domain of 217 residues, a transmembrane domain of 21 residues, and an intracellular domain of 250 residues, as shown in \nFig. 1\n on page 21608 of Domanski \net al.\n Also encompassed by the foregoing terms are fragments of IFNAR2 that contain the extracellular domain (ECD) (or fragments of the ECD) of IFNAR2, and soluble forms of IFNAR2, such as IFNAR2 ECD fused to an immunoglobulin sequence, e.g. IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"native sequence\" in connection with type I interferon, IFN-α or any other polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that has the same amino acid sequence as a corresponding polypeptide derived from nature, regardless of its mode of preparation. Such native sequence polypeptide can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant and/or synthetic means or any combinations thereof. The term \"native sequence\" specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms (\ne.g\n., an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (\ne.g\n., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants of the full length polypeptides. \"Polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,683,195 issued 28 July 1987\n \n. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5' terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally \nMullis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:263 (1987\n); \nErlich, ed., PCR Technology (Stockton Press, NY, 1989\n). As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibodies\" (Abs) and \"immunoglobulins\" (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Native antibodies and immunoglobulins\" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains (\nChothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 186:651 [1985\n]; \nNovotny and Haber, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82:4592 [1985\n]; \nChothia et al., Nature 342: 877-883 [1989\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat \net al.\n (1991) \nsupra).\n The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')\n2\n fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a \"dimeric\" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')\n2\n antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"light chains\" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called κ and λ, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and µ respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody\" includes all classes and subclasses of intact immunoglobulins. The term \"antibody\" also covers antibody fragments. The term \"antibody\" specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, including antibody fragment clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibody fragments\" comprise a portion of an intact antibody that contains the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; single-chain antibody molecules, including single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody (or antibody fragment) obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, and are not contaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, \ne.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" also include clones of antigen-recognition and binding-site containing antibody fragments (Fv clones) isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991\n) and \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991\n), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.\n \n \n;\n \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 [1984\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Humanized\" forms of non-human (\ne.g\n., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from part or all of a complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see \nJones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986\n); \nReichmann et al., Nature, 332:323-329 (1988\n); \nPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992\n); and \nClark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 (2000\n). The humanized antibody includes a Primatized™ antibody wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see \nPluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994\n), \nDall'Acqua and Carter, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 443-450 (1998\n), and \nHudson, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 548-557 (1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues ofN-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody \nin situ\n within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"neutralizing antibody\" is meant an antibody molecule which is able to eliminate or significantly reduce an effector function of a target antigen to which it binds. Accordingly, a \"neutralizing\" anti-IFN-α antibody is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing an effector function, such as receptor binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response, of IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to neutralize the receptor activation activity of IFN-α can be monitored, for example, in a Kinase Receptor Activation (KIRA) Assay as described in \n \nWO 95/14930, published June 1, 1995\n \n, by measuring the ability of a candidate antibody to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation (resulting from ligand binding) of the IFNAR1/R2 receptor complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of the anti-IFN-α antibodies to neutralize the elicitation of a cellular response by IFN-α is preferably tested by monitoring the neutralization of the antiviral activity of IFN-α, as described by \nKawade, J. Interferon Res. 1:61-70 (1980\n), or \nKawade and Watanabe, J. Interferon Res. 4:571-584 (1984\n), or \nYousefi, et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 83: 735-740 (1985\n), or by testing the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to neutralize the ability of IFN-α to activate the binding of the signaling molecule, interferon-stimulated factor 3 (ISGF3), to an oligonucleotide derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, as described by \nKurabayashi et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 15: 6386 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Significant\" reduction means at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99% reduction of an effector function of the target antigen (e.g. IFN-α), such as receptor (e.g. IFNAR2) binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response. Preferably, the \"neutralizing\" antibodies as defined herein will be capable of neutralizing at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99% of the anti-viral activity of IFN-α, as determined by the anti-viral assay of Kawade (1980), \nsupra,\n or Yousefi (1985), \nsupra.\n In another preferred embodiment, the \"neutralizing\" antibodies herein will be capable of reducing tyrosine phosphorylation, due to IFN-α binding, of the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor complex, by at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%; even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99%, as determined in the KIRA assay referenced above. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies herein will be able to neutralize all, or substantially all, subtypes of IFN-α and will not be able to neutralize IFN-∃. In this context, the term \"substantially all\" means that the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody will neutralize at least IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to block the binding of an IFN-α to receptor is defined as the property or capacity of a certain concentration of the antibody to reduce or eliminate the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 in a competition binding assay, as compared to the effect of an equivalent concentration of irrelevant control antibody on IFN-α binding to IFNAR2 in the assay. Preferably, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibody reduces the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 by at least about 50%, or at least about 55%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 65%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 99%, as compared to the irrelevant control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to block the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 can be determined by a routine competition assay such as that described in \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). For example, the IFN-α-binding ELISA assay described in Example 2 below could be modified to employ competition binding between an anti-IFN-α antibody and a soluble IFNAR2. Such an assay could be performed by layering the IFN-α on microtiter plates, incubating the layered plates with serial dilutions of unlabeled anti-IFN-α antibody or unlabeled control antibody admixed with a selected concentration of labeled IFNAR2 ECD-human IgG Fc fusion protein, detecting and measuring the signal in each incubation mixture, and then comparing the signal measurements exhibited by the various dilutions of antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibodies herein will be able to block the IFNAR2-binding of all, or substantially all, subtypes of IFN-α and will not cross-react with IFN-β. In this context, the term \"substantially all\" means that the blocking anti-IFN-α antibody will block the IFNAR2-binding of at least IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibodies of the present invention will block the IFNAR2-binding of all known subtypes of IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"epitope\" is used to refer to binding sites for (monoclonal or polyclonal) antibodies on protein antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies which bind to a particular epitope can be identified by \"epitope mapping.\" There are many methods known in the art for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in Chapter 11 of \nHarlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1999\n. Competition assays are discussed above and below. According to the gene fragment expression assays, the open reading frame encoding the protein is fragmented either randomly or by specific genetic constructions and the reactivity of the expressed fragments of the protein with the antibody to be tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by PCR and then transcribed and translated into protein \nin vitro,\n in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled protein fragments is then determined by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by using large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the surface of phage particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping peptide fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. The latter approach is suitable to define linear epitopes of about 5 to 15 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody binds \"essentially the same epitope\" as a reference antibody, when the two antibodies recognize identical or sterically overlapping epitopes. The most widely used and rapid methods for determining whether two epitopes bind to identical or sterically overlapping epitopes are competition assays, which can be configured in all number of different formats, using either labeled antigen or labeled antibody. Usually, the antigen is immobilized on a 96-well plate, and the ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured using radioactive or enzyme labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term amino acid or amino acid residue, as used herein, refers to naturally occurring L amino acids or to D amino acids as described further below with respect to variants. The commonly used one- and three-letter abbreviations for amino acids are used herein (\nBruce Alberts et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell, Garland Publishing, Inc., New York (3d ed. 1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" with respect to the polypeptide sequences referred to herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and its source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California, and the source code for the ALIGN-2 program and instructions for its use are disclosed in International Application Publication No. \n \nWO2000/39297 published July 6, 2000\n \n. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes herein, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: \n \n \n100\n \n \n \ntimes the fraction X\n \n/\n \nY\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described above using the ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program. However, % amino acid sequence identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (\nAltschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997\n)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask = yes, strand = all, expected occurrences = 10, minimum low complexity length = 15/5, multi-pass e-value = 0.01, constant for multi-pass = 25, dropoff for final gapped alignment = 25 and scoring matrix = BLOSUM62.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: \n \n \n100\n \n \n \ntimes the fraction X\n \n/\n \nY\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"disease state\" refers to a physiological state of a cell or of a whole mammal in which an interruption, cessation, or disorder of cellular or body functions, systems, or organs has occurred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat (including prevention) of a disease, disorder or unwanted physiological conditions in a mammal. In the present invention, an \"effective amount\" of an anti-IFN-α antibody may reduce, slow down or delay an autoimmune disorder such as IDDM or SLE; reduce, prevent or inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) the development of an autoimmune disorder such as IDDM or SLE; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with autoimmune disorders such as IDDM or SLE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of the present invention, the term \"control\" and grammatical variants thereof, are used to refer to the prevention, partial or complete inhibition, reduction, delay or slowing down of an unwanted event, e.g. physiological condition, such as the generation of autoreactive T cells and development of autoimmunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Treatment\" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in which the disorder is to be prevented. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \"Treatment\" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are ones which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween™, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and Pluronics™.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Mammal\" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, \netc.\n Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\n \nB. \nMethods for carrying out the \ninvention\n \n \n\n\n1. Generation of Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n(i) Polyclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. It may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized, such as serum albumin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with a mixture of various, preferably all, IFN-α subtypes in order to generate anti-IFN-α antibodies with broad reactivity against IFN-α subtypes. In another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes that is present in the human lymphoblastoid interferons secreted by Burkitt lymphoma cells (Namalva cells) induced with Sendai virus, as described in Example 1 below. A suitable preparation of such human lymphoblastoid interferons can be obtained commercially (Product No. I-9887) from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Monoclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature 256: 495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized \nin vitro.\n Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, [Academic Press, 1996\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOP-21 and MC.-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (\nKozbor, J. Immunol. 133: 3001 (1984\n);\n Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, [1987\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an \nin vitro\n binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of \nMunson et al., Anal. Biochem. 107: 220 (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the cells may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, Academic Press, 1996\n). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown \nin vivo\n as ascites tumors in an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (\ne.g\n., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli\n cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (\nMorrison, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81: 6851 [1984\n]), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of an anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an IFN-α and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared \nin vitro\n using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant production of antibodies will be described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Humanized antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a non-human source. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \"import\" residues, which are typically taken from an \"import\" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (\nJones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 [1986\n]; \nRiechmann et al., Nature 332: 323-327 [1988\n]; \nVerhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534-1536 [1988\n)]; reviewed in \nClark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 [2000\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, such \"humanized\" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (Cabilly, \nsupra),\n wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequence so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. For further details, see \n \nU.S. patent No. 5,821,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Human antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAttempts to use the same technology for generating human mAbs have been hampered by the lack of a suitable human myeloma cell line. The best results were obtained using heteromyelomas (mouse x human hybrid myelomas) as fusion partners (\nKozbor, J. Immunol. 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur, et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n). Alternatively, human antibody-secreting cells can be immortalized by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, EBV-infected cells are difficult to clone and usually produce only relatively low yields of immunoglobulin (\nJames and Bell, J. Immunol. Methods 100: 5-40 [1987\n]). In future, the immortalization of human B cells might possibly be achieved by introducing a defined combination of transforming genes. Such a possibility is highlighted by a recent demonstration that the expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit together with the SV40 large T oncoprotein and an oncogenic allele of H\n-ras\n resulted in the tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells (\nHahn et al., Nature 400: 464-468 [1999\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production (\nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 [1993\n]; \nLonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 [1995\n]; \nFishwild et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 14: 845-851 [1996\n]; \nMendez et al., Nat. Genet. 15: 146-156 [1997\n]; \nGreen, J. Immunol. Methods 231: 11-23 [1999\n]; \nTomizuka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 722-727 [2000\n]; reviewed in \nLittle et al., Immunol. Today 21: 364-370 [2000\n]). For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region (J\nH\n) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production (\nJakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2551-2555 [1993\n]). Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice results in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge (\nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 [1993\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMendez et al. (Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 [1997\n]) have generated a line of transgenic mice designated as \"XenoMouse\n®\n II\" that, when challenged with an antigen, generates high affinity fully human antibodies. This was achieved by germ-line integration of megabase human heavy chain and light chain loci into mice with deletion into endogenous J\nH\n segment as described above. The XenoMouse\n®\n II harbors 1,020 kb of human heavy chain locus containing approximately 66 V\nH\n genes, complete D\nH\n and J\nH\n regions and three different constant regions (µ, δ and γ), and also harbors 800 kb of human κ locus containing 32 Vκ genes, Jκ segments and Cκ genes. The antibodies produced in these mice closely resemble that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and repertoire. The human antibodies are preferentially expressed over endogenous antibodies due to deletion in endogenous J\nH\n segment that prevents gene rearrangement in the murine locus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTomizuka et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 722-727 [2000\n]) have recently described generation of a double trans-chromosomic (Tc) mice by introducing two individual human chromosome fragments (hCFs), one containing the entire Ig heavy chain locus \n(IgH,\n ∼1.5 Mb) and the other the entire κ light chain locus (\nIg\nκ, ∼2 Mb) into a mouse strain whose endogenous IgH and Igκ loci were inactivated. These mice mounted antigen-specific human antibody response in the absence of mouse antibodies. The Tc technology may allow for the humanization of over megabase-sized, complex loci or gene clusters (such as those encoding T-cell receptors, major histocompatibility complex, P450 cluster etc) in mice or other animals. Another advantage of the method is the elimination of a need of cloning the large loci. This is a significant advantage since the cloning of over megabase-sized DNA fragments encompassing whole Ig loci remains difficult even with the use of yeast artificial chromosomes (\nPeterson et al., Trends Genet. 13: 61-66 [1997\n]; \nJacobovits, Curr. Biol. 4: 761-763 [1994\n]). Moreover, the constant region of the human IgH locus is known to contain sequences difficult to clone (\nKang and Cox, Genomics 35: 189-195 [1996\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments \nin vitro,\n from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors (\nMcCafferty et al., Nature 348: 552-553 [1990\n]; reviewed in \nKipriyanov and Little, Mol. Biotechnol. 12: 173-201 [1999\n]; \nHoogenboom and Chames, Immunol. Today 21: 371-378 [2000\n]). According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats (reviewed in \nJohnson and Chiswell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3: 564-571 [1993\n)]; \nWinter et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12: 433-455 [1994\n]; \nDall'Acqua and Carter, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 443-450 [1998\n]; \nHoogenboom and Chames, Immunol. Today 21: 371-378 [2000\n]). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. \nClackson et al., (Nature 352: 624-628 [1991\n]) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993\n). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as \"chain shuffling\" (\nMarks et al., Bio/Technol. 10: 779-783 [1992\n]). In this method, the affinity of \"primary\" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as \"the mother-of-all libraries\") has been described by \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n), and the isolation of a high affinity human antibody directly from such large phage library is reported by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 13: 3245-3260 (1994\n). Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as \"epitope imprinting\", the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see \n \nPCT patent application WO 93/06213, published 1 April 1993\n \n). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.\n\n\n \n(\nν\n) \nBispecific antibodies\n \n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for an IFN-α to provide a neutralizing antibody, the other one is for any other antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (\nMillstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537-539 [1983\n]). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in \n \nPCT application publication No. WO 93/08829 (published 13 May 1993\n \n), and in \nTraunecker et al., EMBO J. 10: 3655-3659 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different and more preferred approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance. In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, \nSuresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121, 210 (1986\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n(vi) Heteroconjugate antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies are also within the. scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n), and for treatment of HIV infection (\n \nPCT application publication Nos. WO 91/00360\n \n and \n \nWO 92/200373\n \n; \n \nEP 03089\n \n). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n\n\n(vii) Antibody fragments\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody (including murine, human and humanized antibodies, and antibody variants) is an antibody fragment. Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, \ne.g.,\n \nMorimoto et al., J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 24:107-117 [1992\n] and \nBrennan et al., Science 229:81 [1985\n]). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells (reviewed in \nHudson, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 548-557 [1999\n]; \nLittle et al., Immunol. Today 21: 364-370 [2000\n]). For example, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli\n and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (\nCarter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 [1992\n]). In another embodiment, the F(ab')\n2\n is formed using the leucine zipper GCN4 to promote assembly of the F(ab')\n2\n molecule. According to another approach, Fv, Fab or F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.\n\n\n \n\n\n(viii) Amino acid sequence variants of antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence modification(s) of the anti-IFN-α antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IFN-α antibodies are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the nucleic acid encoding the anti-IFN-α antibody chains, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the anti-IFN-α antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the anti-IFN-α antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis,\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989\n). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (\ne.g\n., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation \nper se\n need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed anti-IFN-α antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intra-sequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an anti-IFN-α neutralizing antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the anti-IFN-α antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitution mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"preferred substitutions\". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n \n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOriginal Residue\n \n \n \nExemplary Substitutions\n \n \n \nPreferred Substitutions\n \n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nval; leu; ile\n \nval\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nlys; gln; asn\n \nlys\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \ngln; his; asp, lys; arg\n \ngln\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nglu; asn\n \nglu\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nser; ala\n \nser\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nasn; glu\n \nasn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nasp; gln\n \nasp\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nala\n \nala\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nasn; gin; lys; arg\n \narg\n \n \n \nIle (1)\n \nleu; val; met; ala; phe; norleucine\n \nleu\n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala; phe\n \nile\n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \narg; gln; asn\n \narg\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nleu; phe; ile\n \nleu\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n \ntyr\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nala\n \nala\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nthr\n \nthr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nser\n \nser\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \ntyr; phe\n \ntyr\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n \nphe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nile; leu; met; phe; ala; norleucine\n \nleu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;\n \n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n \n(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;\n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n \n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fv fragment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly preferred type of substitution variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (\ne.g\n. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitution variants is affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (\ne.g\n. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (\ne.g\n. antagonist activity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or in addition, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and IFN-α. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ix) Glycosylation Variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (\nJefferis and Lund, Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128 [1997\n]; \nWright and Morrison, Trends Biotechnol. 15:26-32 [1997\n]). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (\nBoyd et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318 [1996\n]; \nWittwe and Howard, Biochem. 29:4175-4180 [1990\n]), and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, \nsupra;\n \nWyss and Wagner, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416 [1996\n]). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. For example, it has been reported that in agalactosylated IgG, the oligosaccharide moiety 'flips' out of the inter-CH2 space and terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues become available to bind mannose binding protein (\nMalhotra et al., Nature Med. 1:237-243 [1995\n]). Removal by glycopeptidase of the oligosaccharides from CAMPATH-1H (a recombinant humanized murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody which recognizes the CDw52 antigen of human lymphocytes) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells resulted in a complete reduction in complement mediated lysis (CMCL) (\nBoyd et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318 [1996\n]), while selective removal of sialic acid residues using neuraminidase resulted in no loss of DMCL. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of β(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (\nUmana et al., Mature Biotech. 17:176-180 [1999\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation variants of antibodies are variants in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody, changing the composition of glycosylation (glycosylation pattern), the extent of glycosylation, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites). Similarly, removal of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by amino acid alteration within the native glycosylation sites of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence is usually altered by altering the underlying nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IFN-α antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the anti-IFN-α antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation (including glycosylation pattern) of antibodies may also be altered without altering the amino acid sequence or the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, \ne.g\n. antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, significant variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g. \nHse et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070 [1997\n]). In addition to the choice of host cells, factors which affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (\n \nU. S. Patent Nos. 5,047,335\n \n; \n \n5,510,261\n \n and \n \n5.278,299\n \n). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered, e.g. make defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation structure of antibodies can be readily analyzed by conventional techniques of carbohydrate analysis, including lectin chromatography, NMR, Mass spectrometry, HPLC, GPC, monosaccharide compositional analysis, sequential enzymatic digestion, and HPAEC-PAD, which uses high pH anion exchange chromatography to separate oligosaccharides based on charge. Methods for releasing oligosaccharides for analytical purposes are also known, and include, without limitation, enzymatic treatment (commonly performed using peptide-N-glycosidase F/endo-β-galactosidase), elimination using harsh alkaline environment to release mainly O-linked structures, and chemical methods using anhydrous hydrazine to release both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides.\n\n\n \n\n\n(x) Other modifications of antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in \nEpstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688 (1985\n); \nHwang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030 (1980\n); and \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045\n \n and \n \n4,544,545\n \n. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,013,556\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab' fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in \nMartin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:286-288 (1982\n) via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent (such as Doxorubicin) is optionally contained within the liposome. See \nGabizon et al., J. National Cancer Inst.81(19):1484 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug-activating enzyme which converts a prodrug (\ne.g\n., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see \n \nWO81/01145\n \n to an active drug. See, for example, \n \nWO 88/07378\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,278\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active form exhibiting the desired biological properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as β-galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; β-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with 3-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as \"abzymes\", can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, \ne.g.,\n \nMassey, Nature 328:457-458 (1987\n)). Antibody-abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a desired cell population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymes can be covalently bound to the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively, fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art (see, e.g., \nNeuberger et al., Nature 312:604-608 [1984\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, it may be desirable to use an antibody fragment, rather than an intact antibody. In this case, it may be desirable to modify the antibody fragment in order to increase its serum half-life. This may be achieved, for example, by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment (e.g., by mutation of the appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle, e.g., by DNA or peptide synthesis). See \n \nWO96/32478 published October 17, 1996\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salvage receptor binding epitope generally constitutes a region wherein any one or more amino acid residues from one or two loops of a Fc domain are transferred to an analogous position of the antibody fragment. Even more preferably, three or more residues from one or two loops of the Fc domain are transferred. Still more preferred, the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region (e.g., of an IgG) and transferred to the CH1, CH3, or V\nH\n region, or more than one such region, of the antibody. Alternatively, the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region and transferred to the C\nL\n region or V\nL\n region, or both, of the antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent modifications of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies are also included within the scope of this invention. They may be made by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody, if applicable. Other types of covalent modifications of the antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues. Exemplary covalent modifications of polypeptides are described in \n \nUS Patent 5,534,615\n \n, specifically incorporated herein by reference. A preferred type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the antibody to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835\n \n; \n \n4,496,689\n \n; \n \n4,301,144\n \n; \n \n4,670,417\n \n; \n \n4,791,192\n \n or \n \n4,179,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n2. Screening for antibodies with the desired properties\n\n\n \n \n \nTechniques for generating antibodies have been described above. Anti-IFN-α antibodies with the desired, broad range neutralizing properties can then be identified by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\n(i) Binding Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThus, for example, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies of the present invention can be identified in IFN-α binding assays, by incubating a candidate antibody with one or more individual IFN-α subtypes, or an array or mixture of various IFN-α subtypes, and monitoring binding and neutralization of a biological activity of IFN-α. The binding assay may be performed with purified IFN-α polypeptide(s). In one embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti-IFN-α antibody for IFN-α binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the ELISA format, also illustrated in the Examples below. IFN-α binding of a candidate antibody may also be monitored in a BIAcore\n™\n Biosensor assay, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable competition binding assay known in the art can be used to characterize the ability of a candidate anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody to compete with murine anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibody 9F3 for binding to a particular IFN-α species. A routine competition assay is described in \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). In another embodiment, the IFN-α-binding ELISA assay described in Example 2 below could be modified to employ IFN-α binding competition between a candidate antibody and the 9F3 antibody. Such an assay could be performed by layering the IFN-α on microtiter plates, incubating the layered plates with serial dilutions of unlabeled anti-IFN-α antibody or unlabeled control antibody admixed with a selected concentration of labeled 9F3 antibody, detecting and measuring the signal from the 9F3 antibody label, and then comparing the signal measurements exhibited by the various dilutions of antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Antiviral Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a candidate antibody to neutralize a biological activity of IFN-α can, for example, be carried out by monitoring the neutralization of the antiviral activity of IFN-α as described by\n Kawade, J. Interferon Res. 1:61-70 (1980\n), or \nKawade and Watanabe, J. Interferon Res. 4:571-584 (1984\n). Briefly, a fixed concentration of IFN-α premixed with various dilutions of a candidate antibody is added to human amnion-derived FL cells, and the ability of the candidate antibody to neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-α is determined, using an appropriate virus, e.g. Sindbis virus. The titers are expressed in international units (IU), as determined with the international reference human IFN-α (NIH Ga23-901-527).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe candidate anti-IFN-α antibody is considered able to inhibit the anti-viral activity of a selected IFN-α subtype if a certain concentration of the antibody inhibits more anti-viral activity than the baseline level of anti-viral activity inhibition measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody. Optionally, the certain concentration of the candidate anti-IFN-α antibody will inhibit at least or about 60%, or at least or about 70%, preferably at least or about 75%, or more preferably at least or about 80%, or even more preferably at least or about 85%, or still more preferably at least or about 90%, or still more preferably at least or about 95%, or most preferably at least or about 99% of the anti-viral activity of the selected IFN-α subtype in the anti-viral activity assay as compared to baseline activity measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody. The candidate anti-IFN-α antibody is considered unable to inhibit the anti-viral activity of a selected IFN-α subtype if there is no concentration of the antibody that exhibits more anti-viral activity inhibition than the baseline level of anti-viral activity inhibition measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, each interferon species used in the viral infectivity assay is titrated to a concentration that provides the same level of inhibition of viral growth as that induced by a preselected number of units of an IFN-α standard. This concentration serves to provide the normalized units of the subject interferon species. In order to assess the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to inhibit the anti-viral activity of various IFN-α subtypes, the effective concentration (EC50) of anti-IFN-α antibody for inhibiting 50% of a particular IFN-α subtype's anti-viral activity (at the concentration titrated to provide the normalized units of activity) is determined for each IFN-α subtype to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antiviral activity neutralization assay is performed as described in Example 1 below. Briefly, A549 cells are grown to a density of 5x10\n5\n A549 cells/well on 96-well microtiter plates. Serial dilutions of candidate anti-IFN-α antibody are incubated with 0.2 units/:1 of a selected IFN-α subtype (normalized to 0.2 units/:l of NIH reference standard recombinant human IFN-α2) in a total volume of 100 :1 at 37EC for one hour. Each 100 :1 volume of antibody/interferon incubation mixture is then added to 5x10\n5\n A549 cells and 100 :1 of culture medium in an individual well on the microtiter plate, yielding a final IFN-α concentration of 100 units/ml in each well. The resulting cell culture mixtures are incubated for 24 hours at 37EC. Cells are then challenged with 2x10\n5\n pfu of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus and incubated for an additional 24 hours at 37EC. At the end of the incubation, cell viability is determined by visual microscopic examination or crystal violet staining. The effective concentration (EC50) of a candidate IFN-α antibody for inhibiting 50% of a particular IFN-α subtype's anti-viral activity in the assay is determined for each IFN-α subtype to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the anti-IFN-α antibody that exhibits anti-viral activity neutralization against the subject IFN-α subtypes will exhibit an EC50 of up to or about 20 :g/ml, or up to or about 10 :g/ml, or up to or about 5 :g/ml, or up to or about 4 :g/ml, or up to or about 3 :g/ml, or up to or about 2 :g/ml, or up to or about 1 :g/ml with respect to each

each of the subject IFN-α subtypes in the A549 cell EMC viral inhibition assay described above.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Cross-blocking Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on IFN-α bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n), can be performed. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example, the IFN-α epitope bound by a monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be determined by competitive binding analysis as described in \nFendly et al. Cancer Research 50:1550 -1558 (1990\n). In another example, cross-blocking studies can be done with direct fluorescence on microtiter plates. In this method, the monoclonal antibody of interest is conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), using established procedures (\nWofsy et al. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, p. 287, Mishel and Schiigi (eds.) San Francisco: W.J. Freeman Co. (1980\n)). The selected IFN-α is layered onto the wells of microtiter plates, the layered wells are incubated with mixtures of (1) FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody of interest and (2) unlabeled test monoclonal antibody, and the fluorescence in each well is quantitated to determine the level of cross-blocking exhibited by the antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are considered to share an epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or greater in comparison to an irrelevant monoclonal antibody control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results obtained in the cell-based biological assays can then be followed by testing in animal, e.g. murine, models, and human clinical trials. If desired, murine monoclonal antibodies identified as having the desired properties can be converted into chimeric antibodies, or humanized by techniques well known in the art, including the \"gene conversion mutagenesis\" strategy, as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,821,337\n \n, the entire disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Humanization of a particular anti-IFN-α antibody herein is also described in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Phage Display Method\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention can be identified by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments (e.g. Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, etc.) of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-IFN-α antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat \net al.\n (1991), \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction of phage display libraries\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids each, from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as or D(ab')\n2\n fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab or F(ab')\n2\n encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as \"Fv phage clones\" or \"Fv clones\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe naive repertoire of an animal (the repertoire before antigen challenge) provides it with antibodies that can bind with moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n) to essentially any non-self molecule. The sequence diversity of antibody binding sites is not encoded directly in the germline but is assembled in a combinatorial manner from V gene segments. In human heavy chains, the first two hypervariable loops (H1 and H2) are drawn from less than 50 VH gene segments, which are combined with D segments and JH segments to create the third hypervariable loop (H3). In human light chains, the first two hypervariable loops (L1 and L2) and much of the third (L3) are drawn from less than approximately 30 V8 and less than approximately 30 V6 segments to complete the third hypervariable loop (L3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach combinatorial rearrangement of V-gene segments in stem cells gives rise to a B cell that expresses a single VH-VL combination. Immunizations triggers any B cells making a combination that binds the immunogen to proliferate (clonal expansion) and to secrete the corresponding antibody. These naive antibodies are then matured to high affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of 10\n9\n-10\n10\n M\n-1\n) by a process of mutagenesis and selection known as affinity maturation. It is after this point that cells are normally removed to prepare hybridomas and generate high-affinity monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt three stages of this process, repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993\n). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V- or VIII-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display mimics the B cell. Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or as Fab (including F(ab')\n2\n) fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in \nHoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991\n). When antibody fragments are fused to the N-terminus of pIII, the phage is infective. However, if the N-terminal domain of pIII is excised and fusions made to the second domain, the phage is not infective, and wild type pIII must be provided by helper phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pIII fusion and other proteins of the phage can be encoded entirely within the same phage replicon, or on different replicons. When two replicons are used, the pIII fusion is encoded on a phagemid, a plasmid containing a phage origin of replication. Phagemids can be packaged into phage particles by \"rescue\" with a helper phage such as M13K07 that provides all the phage proteins, including pIII, but due to a defective origin is itself poorly packaged in competitions with the phagemids as described in Vieira and \nMessing, Meth. Enzymol., 153: 3-11 (1987\n). In a preferred method, the phage display system is designed such that the recombinant phage can be grown in host cells under conditions permitting no more than a minor amount of phage particles to display more than one copy of the Fv-coat protein fusion on the surface of the particle as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n (\n \nPCT/US91/09133 published June 11, 1992\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-IFN-α clones is desired, the subject is immunized with IFN-α to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-human IFN-α clones is obtained by generating an anti-human IFN-α antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that IFN-α immunization gives rise to B cells producing human-sequence antibodies against IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with a mixture of various, preferably all, IFN-α subtypes in order to generate an antibody response that includes B cells producing anti-IFN-α antibodies with broad reactivity against IFN-α subtypes. In another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes that is present in the human lymphoblastoid interferons secreted by Burkitt lymphoma cells (Namalva cells) induced with Sendai virus, as described in Example 1 below. A suitable preparation of such human lymphoblastoid interferons can be obtained commercially (Product No. I-9887) from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-IFN-α reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing IFN-α-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation with IFN-α affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled IFN-α followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which IFN-α is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating \nin vitro\n antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in \nOrlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989\n), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) and in \nWard et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989\n). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in \nJones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991\n), and forward primers within the constant region as described in \nSastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989\n). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) or Sastry \net al.\n (1989). Preferably, the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n) or as described in the method of \nOrum et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993\n). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nTomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992\n)), and mapped (reported in \nMatsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993\n); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and \nWinter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focussed in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992\n). Human V6 and V8 segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nWilliams and Winter, Eur. J. Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993\n)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged \nin vitro\n according to the methods of \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined \nin vitro,\n e.g., as described in \nHogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993\n), or \nin vivo\n by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n). The \nin vivo\n recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE. coli\n transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12\n clones). Both vectors contain \nin vivo\n recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n-8\n M).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, \"in cell PCR assembly\" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in \nEmbleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked \nin vitro\n by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter \net al.\n (1994), \nsupra.\n For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in \nLeung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989\n)) in the method of \nHawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992\n) or in the method of \nGram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992\n). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. \n \nWO 9607754 (published 14 March 1996\n \n) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10\n-9\n M range.\n\n\n \n\n\nPanning Phage Display Libraries for Anti-IFN-α\n\n\nClones\n\n\n\n\na. Synthesis of IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acid sequence encoding the IFN-α subtypes used herein can be designed using published amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of interferons, e.g. see the \nJ. Interferon Res., 13: 443-444 (1993\n) compilation of references containing genomic and cDNA sequences for various type I interferons, and the references cited therein. For the IFN-αA (IFN-α2), IFN-αB (IFN-α8), IFN-αC (IFN-α10), IFN-αD (IFN-α1), IFN-αE (IFN-α22), IFN-αF (IFN-α21), IFN-αG (IFN-α5), and IFN-αH (IFN-α14) amino acid sequences or cDNA sequences, see \nFigs. 3\n and \n4\n on pages 23-24 of \nGoeddel et al., Nature, 290: 20-26 (1981\n). For cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence of IFN-α7 (IFN-αJ), see \nCohen et al., Dev. Biol. Standard, 60: 111-122 (1985\n). DNAs encoding the interferons of interest can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in \nEngels et al., Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 28: 716-734 (1989\n), such as the triester, phosphite, phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate methods. In one embodiment, codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the interferon-encoding DNA. Alternatively, DNA encoding the interferon can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library. Following construction of the DNA molecule encoding the interferon of interest, the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector, such as a plasmid, wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general, plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expression in prokaryotic hosts, suitable vectors include pBR322 (ATCC No. 37,017), phGH107 (ATCC No. 40,011), pBO475, pS0132, pRIT5, any vector in the pRIT20 or pRIT30 series (\nNilsson and Abrahmsen, Meth. Enzymol., 185: 144-161 (1990\n)), pRIT2T, pKK233-2, pDR540 and pPL-lambda. Prokaryotic host cells containing the expression vectors suitable for use herein include \nE. coli\n K12 strain 294 (ATCC NO. 31446), \nE coli\n strain JM101 (\nMessing et al., Nucl.Acid Res., 9: 309 (1981\n)), \nE. coli\n strain B, \nE. coli\n strain II1776 (ATCC No. 31537), \nE. coli\n c600 (Appleyard, \nGenetics,\n 39: 440 (1954)), \nE. coli\n W3110 (F-, gamma-, prototrophic, ATCC No. 27325), \nE. coli\n strain 27C7 (W3110, \ntonA, phoA E15, (argF-lac)169, ptr3, degP41, ompT, kan\nr\n)\n (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,288,931\n \n, ATCC No. 55,244), \nBacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcesans,\n and \nPseudomonas\n species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic organisms, such as yeasts, or cells derived from multicellular organisms can be used as host cells. For expression in yeast host cells, such as common baker's yeast or \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae,\n suitable vectors include episomally replicating vectors based on the 2-micron plasmid, integration vectors, and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors. For expression in insect host cells, such as Sf9 cells, suitable vectors include baculoviral vectors. For expression in plant host cells, particularly dicotyledonous plant hosts, such as tobacco, suitable expression vectors include vectors derived from the Ti plasmid of \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate host cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cells include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, \nGraham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36: 59 (1977\n)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, \nUrlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4216 (1980\n)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, \nMather, Biol. Reprod., 23: 243-251 (1980\n)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (\nMather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci., 383: 44-68 (1982\n)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). For expression in mammalian host cells, useful vectors include vectors derived from SV40, vectors derived from cytomegalovirus such as the pRK vectors, including pRK5 and pRK7 (\nSuva et al., Science, 237: 893-896 (1987\n), \n \nEP 307,247 (3/15/89\n \n), \n \nEP 278,776 (8/17/88\n \n)) vectors derived from vaccinia viruses or other pox viruses, and retroviral vectors such as vectors derived from Moloney's murine leukemia virus (MoMLV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the DNA encoding the interferon of interest is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII, ecotin, lamB, herpes GD, 1pp, alkaline phosphatase, invertase, and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A (\nAbrahmsen et al., EMBO J., 4: 3901 (1985\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO\n4\n precipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning (2nd ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY (1989\n), is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Infection with \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by \nShaw et al., Gene, 23: 315 (1983\n) and \n \nWO 89/05859 published 29 June 1989\n \n. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method described in sections 16.30-16.37 of Sambrook \net al., supra,\n is preferred. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by Axel in \n \nU.S. 4,399,216 issued 16 August 1983\n \n. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of \nVan Solingen et al., J. Bact., 130: 946 (1977\n) and \nHsiao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 76: 3829 (1979\n). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear injection, electroporation, or by protoplast fusion may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells used to produce the interferon of interest can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook \net al., supra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mammalian host cells used to produce the interferon of interest can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in \nHam and Wallace, Meth. Enz., 58: 44 (1979\n), \nBarnes and Sato, Anal. Biochem., 102: 255 (1980\n), \n \nU.S. 4,767,704\n \n; \n \n4,657,866\n \n; \n \n4,927,762\n \n; or \n \n4,560,655\n \n; \n \nWO 90/03430\n \n; \n \nWO 87/00195\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Re. 30,985\n \n; or \n \nU.S. 5,122,469\n \n, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin\n™\n drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in \nin vitro\n culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an intracellular expression system or periplasmic space secretion system, the recombinantly expressed interferon protein can be recovered from the culture cells by disrupting the host cell membrane/cell wall (e.g. by osmotic shock or solubilizing the host cell membrane in detergent). Alternatively, in an extracellular secretion system, the recombinant protein can be recovered from the culture medium. As a first step, the culture medium or lysate is centrifuged to remove any particulate cell debris. The membrane and soluble protein fractions are then separated. Usually, the interferon is purified from the soluble protein fraction. If the IFN-α is expressed as a membrane bound species, the membrane bound peptide can be recovered from the membrane fraction by solubilization with detergents. The crude peptide extract can then be further purified by suitable procedures such as fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; hydrophobic affinity resins and ligand affinity using interferon receptor immobilized on a matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the human IFN-α used herein can be obtained from commercial sources, e.g. from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation (San Diego, CA) or ACCURATE Chemical & Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard cloning procedures described in \nManiatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989\n) are used to construct plasmids that direct the translocation of the various species of hIFN-α into the periplasmic space of \nE. coli.\n PCR reactions are performed on cDNA clones of the various subspecies of hIFN-α disclosed in \nGoeddel et al., Nature 290: 20-26 (1981\n) with Nsil and StyI restriction sites added to the primers. These PCR products are then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pB0720 described in \nCunningham et al., Science 243:1330-1336 (1989\n). The resulting plasmids place production of the hIFN-α subtypes under control of the \nE. coli phoA\n promoter and the heat-stable enterotoxin II signal peptide as described in \nChang et al., Gene 55: 189-196 (1987\n). The correct DNA sequence of each gene is confirmed using the United States Biochemical Sequenase Kit version 2.0. Each plasmid is transformed into the \nE. coli\n strain 27C7 (ATCC # 55244) and grown in 10 liter fermentors as described in \nCarter et al.,Bio/Technology 10: 163-167 (1992\n). Human hIFNs are purified from \nE. coli\n paste containing each IFN-α by affinity chromatography. Bacterial cells are lysed, and the lysate is centrifuged at 10,000 x g to remove debris. The supernatant is applied to an immunoaffinity column containing a mouse anti-hIFN-αB antibody (LI-1) that is obtained as described in \nStaehelin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78:1848-1852 (1981\n). LI-1 is immobilized on controlled pore glass by a modification of the method of \nRoy et al., Journal of Chromatography, 303: 225-228 (1984\n). The bound interferon is eluted from the column with 0.1 M citrate, pH 3.0, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol. The purified IFN is analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and is assayed for bioactivity by the hIFN-induced anti-viral assay as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman IFN-α2/1 hybrid molecule (IFN-α2\n1-62\n/α\n64-166\n) was obtained as described in \nRehberg et al., J. Biol. Chem., 257: 11497-11502 (1992\n) or \nHorisberger and Marco, Pharmac. Ther., 66: 507-534 (1995\n).\n\n\n \nb. Immobilization of IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purified IFN-α can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads, acrylamide beads, glass beads, cellulose, various acrylic copolymers, hydroxyl methacrylate gels, polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers, nylon, neutral and ionic carriers, and the like, for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the IFN-α protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in \nMethods in Enzymology, vol. 44 (1976\n). A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices, e.g. agarose, dextran or cellulose, involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand's primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, IFN-α can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other art-known method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \nc. Panning Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized IFN-α under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phage bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or by alkali, e.g. as described in \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or by IFN-α antigen, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). Phage can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phage can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, phage are serially incubated with various IFN-α subtypes immobilized in order to identify and further characterize phage clones that exhibit appreciable binding to a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes. In this method, phage are first incubated with one specific IFN-α subtype. The phage bound to this subtype are eluted and subjected to selection with another IFN-α subtype. The process of binding and elution is thus repeated with all IFN-α subtypes. At the end, the procedure yields a population of phage displaying antibodies with broad reactivity against all IFN-α subtypes. These phage can then be tested against other IFN species, i.e. other than IFN-α, in order to select those clones which do not show appreciable binding to other species of IFNs. Finally, the selected phage clones can be examined for their ability to neutralize biological activity, e.g. anti-viral activity, of various IFN-α subtypes, and clones representing antibodies with broad neutralization activity against a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes are finally selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n, and a low coating density of antigen as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for IFN-α. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting IFN-α, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants, phage can be incubated with excess biotinylated IFN-α, but with the biotinylated IFN-α at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for IFN-α. The high affinity-binding phage can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such \"equilibrium capture\" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phage with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phage bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, phage are serially incubated with various IFN-α subtypes immobilized on a solid support, such as chromatographic polymer matrix beads described above. In this method, the phage are first incubated with one specific IFN-α subtype. The phage bound to this subtype are eluted from solid phase with a suitable eluent, such as any salt or acid buffer capable of releasing the bound phage into solution. Next, the eluted phage clones are subjected to selection with another IFN-α subtype. In order to enrich the population for clones that compete with soluble IFNAR2 for binding to IFN-α, the phage clones recovered from the series of IFN-α subtype chromatographic separations are incubated with a complex of immobilized IFNAR2 preadsorbed to IFN-α, and the non-adsorbed phage clones are recovered from the incubation reaction mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection procedures can be designed to utilize any suitable batch chromatographic technique. In one embodiment, the phage clones are adsorbed to IFN-α-derivatized polymer matrix beads in suspension, the adsorbed beads are recovered by centrifugation, the recovered beads are resuspended and incubated in a suitable elution buffer, such as any salt or acid buffer capable of releasing the bound phage into solution, the elution mixture is centrifuged, the eluted phage clones are recovered from the supernatant, and then the adsorption/elution procedure is repeated for every additional IFN-α subtype. In order to enrich the population for clones that compete with soluble IFNAR2 for binding to IFN-α, the phage clones recovered from the IFN-α subtype chromatographic separations are incubated with a suspension of IFNAR2-derivatized polymer matrix beads preadsorbed to IFN-α, the incubation mixture is centrifuged, and the non-adsorbed phage clones are recovered from the supernatant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the selection procedure is designed to enrich the phage population for the property of inhibiting IFN-α binding to IFNAR2 during each of the affinity chromatographic separations. In this method, the phage are serially incubated with each of the specific IFN-α subtypes immobilized on a solid support and then eluted from solid phase with an eluent comprising an excess of soluble IFNAR2, such as IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc, under conditions wherein soluble IFNAR2 is capable of displacing any phage clone that competes with IFNAR2 for binding to the immobilized IFN-α. The process of binding and elution is thus repeated with each of the specific IFN-α subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the phage clones are adsorbed to IFN-α-derivatized polymer matrix beads in suspension, the adsorbed beads are recovered by centrifugation, the recovered beads are resuspended and incubated in a suitable elution buffer comprising an excess of soluble IFNAR2 (such as IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc) under conditions wherein the soluble IFNAR2 is capable of displacing any phage clone that competes with IFNAR2 for binding to the immobilized IFN-α and releasing the bound phage into solution, the elution mixture is centrifuged, the eluted phage clones are recovered from the supernatant, and then the adsorption/elution procedure is repeated for every additional IFN-α subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end, the procedure yields a population of phage displaying antibodies with IFNAR2-binding inhibition activity against a broad range of IFN-α subtypes. These phage can then be tested against other IFN species (other than IFN-α species), such as IFN-∃, in order to select those clones which do not show appreciable binding to other species of IFNs. Finally, the selected phage clones can be examined for their ability to neutralize biological activity, e.g. anti-viral activity, of various IFN-α subtypes, and clones representing antibodies with broad neutralization activity against a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes are finally selected.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nActivity Selection of Anti-IFN-α Clones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides anti-IFN-α antibodies that bind to as well as neutralize the activity of a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes, but do not significantly bind to or neutralize the activity of any other interferon species. For example, the ability of various phage clones to neutralize the anti-viral activities of various IFN-α subtypes can be tested, essentially in the same manner as described earlier for the antibodies.\n\n\n \n4. Preparation of soluble IFNAR2-IgG\n\n\n \n \n \nA cDNA encoding the human immunoglobulin fusion proteins (immunoadhesins) based on the extracellular domain (ECD) of the hIFNAR2 (pRK5 hIFNAR2-IgG clone) can be generated using methods similar to those described by \nHaak-Frendscho et al., Immunology 79: 594-599 (1993\n) for the construction of a murine IFN-( receptor immunoadhesin. Briefly, the plasmid pRKCD4\n2\nFc\n1\n is constructed as described in Example 4 of \n \nWO 89/02922\n \n (\n \nPCT/US88/03414 published April 6, 1989\n \n). The cDNA coding sequence for the first 216 residues of the mature hIFNAR2 ECD is obtained from the published sequence (\nNovick et al., Cell, 77: 391-400 [1994\n]). The CD4 coding sequence in the pRKCD4\n2\nFc\n1\n is replaced with the hIFNAR2 ECD encoding cDNA to form the pRK5hIFNAR2-IgG clone. hIFNAR2-IgG is expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by transient transfection using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique. The immunoadhesin is purified from serum-free cell culture supernatants in a single step by affinity chromatography on a protein A-sepharose column as described in Haak-Frendscho \net al.\n (1993), \nsupra.\n Bound hIFNAR2-IgG is eluted with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol. The hIFNAR2-IgG purified is over 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n5. Diagnostic uses of anti-IFN-α antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention are unique research reagents in diagnostic assays for IFN-α expression. As discussed earlier, IFN-α expression is increased in certain autoimmune diseases such as IDDM, SLE, and autoimmune thyroiditis. Increased expression of various IFN-α subtypes in such disorders can be detected and quantitated using anti-IFN-α antibodies of the instant invention with broad reactivity against a majority of IFN-α subtypes. Anti-IFN-α antibodies are also useful for the affinity purification of various IFN-α subtypes from recombinant cell culture or natural sources.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibodies can be used for the detection of IFN-α in any one of a number of well known diagnostic assay methods. For example, a biological sample may be assayed for IFN-α by obtaining the sample from a desired source, admixing the sample with anti-IFN-α antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody/IFN-α complex with any IFN-α subtype present in the mixture, and detecting any antibody/IFN-α complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody/IFN-α complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include competitive and sandwich assays, and steric inhibition assays. Competitive and sandwich methods employ a phase-separation step as an integral part of the method while steric inhibition assays are conducted in a single reaction mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical methods for IFN-α all use one or more of the following reagents: labeled IFN-α analogue, immobilized IFN-α analogue, labeled anti-IFN-α antibody, immobilized anti-IFN-α antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as \"tracers.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of IFN-α and anti-IFN-α antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay, examples including moieties that may be detected directly, such as fluorochrome, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels, as well as moieties, such as enzymes, that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456\n \n), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis-imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above-described fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and enzyme labels. See, for example, \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475\n \n (fluorimetry) and \n \n3,645,090\n \n (enzymes); \nHunter et al., Nature, 144: 945 (1962\n); \nDavid et al., Biochemistry, 13: 1014-1021 (1974\n); \nPain et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 40: 219-230 (1981\n); and \nNygren, J. Histochem. and Cytochem., 30: 407-412 (1982\n). Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugation of such label, including the enzymes, to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See, for example, \nO'Sullivan et al., \"\nMethods for the Preparation of Enzyme-antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay,\n\" in Methods in Enzymology, ed. J.J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis, Vol. 73 (Academic Press, New York, New York, 1981), pp. 147-166\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti-IFN-α antibody from any IFN-α that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-IFN-α antibody or IFN-α analogue before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (\n \nBennich et al.., U.S. 3,720,760\n \n), by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-IFN-α antibody or IFN-α analogue afterward, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther assay methods, known as competitive or sandwich assays, are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer IFN-α analogue to compete with the test sample IFN-α for a limited number of anti-IFN-α antibody antigen-binding sites. The anti-IFN-α antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and IFN-α bound to the anti-IFN-α antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and IFN-α. This separation is accomplished by decanting (where the binding partner was pre-insolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction). The amount of test sample IFN-α is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose-response curves with known amounts of IFN-α are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of IFN-α present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother species of competitive assay, called a \"homogeneous\" assay, does not require a phase separation. Here, a conjugate of an enzyme with the IFN-α is prepared and used such that when anti-IFN-α antibody binds to the IFN-α the presence of the anti-IFN-α antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case, the IFN-α or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti-IFN-α antibody so that binding of the anti-IFN-α antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method \nper se\n is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low-molecular-weight hapten to a small IFN-α fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti-IFN-α antibody. Under this assay procedure the IFN-α present in the test sample will bind anti-IFN-α antibody, thereby allowing anti-hapten to bind the conjugate, resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten, e.g., a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of IFN-α or anti-IFN-α antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti-IFN-α antibody is used to adsorb test sample IFN-α, the test sample is removed as by washing, the bound IFN-α is used to adsorb a second, labeled anti-IFN-α antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample IFN-α. In \"simultaneous\" sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti-IFN-α. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti-IFN-α antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing are merely exemplary diagnostic assays for IFN-α. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti-IFN-α antibody for the determination of IFN-α are included within the scope hereof, including the bioassays described above.\n\n\n \n6. Therapeutic compositions and administration of anti-IFN-α antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers \n(\n \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition, Alfonso, R., ed, Mack Publishing Co. (Easton, PA: 1995\n)), in the form of lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IFN-α antibody to be used for \nin vivo\n administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The anti-IFN-α antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic anti-IFN-α antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of anti-IFN-α antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g. injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intracerebrospinal, or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems as noted below. Preferably the antibody is given systemically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (\n \nU.S. 3,773,919\n \n, \n \nEP 58,481\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (\nSidman et al., Biopolymers, 22: 547-556 (1983\n)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (\nLanger et al., J Biomed. Mater. Res., 15: 167-277 (1981\n) and \nLanger, Chem. Tech., 12: 98-105 (1982\n)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer \net al., supra)\n or poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (\n \nEP 133,988\n \n). Sustained-release anti-IFNAR2 antibody compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibody. Liposomes containing antibody are prepared by methods known \nper se:\n \n \nDE 3,218,121\n \n; \nEpstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 3688-3692 (1985\n); \nHwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4030-4034 (1980\n); \n \nEP 52,322\n \n; \n \nEP 36,676\n \n; \n \nEP 88,046\n \n; \n \nEP 143,949\n \n; \n \nEP 142,641\n \n; Japanese patent application \n \n83-118008\n \n; \n \nU.S. 4,485,045\n \n and \n \n4,544,545\n \n; and \n \nEP 102,324\n \n. Ordinarily the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. % cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal antibody therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibody can also be administered by inhalation. Commercially available nebulizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liquid formulations can be directly nebulized and lyophilized powder can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively, anti-IFN-α antibody can be aerosolized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a metered dose inhaler, or inhaled as a lyophilized and milled powder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"effective amount\" of anti-IFN-α antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, the type of anti-IFN-α antibody employed, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer the anti-IFN-α antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patients to be treated with the anti-IFN-α antibody of the invention include preclinical patients or those with recent onset of immune-mediated disorders, and particularly autoimmune disorders. Patients are candidates for therapy in accord with this invention until such point as no healthy tissue remains to be protected from immune-mediated destruction. For example, a patient suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can benefit from therapy with an anti-IFN-α antibody of the invention until the patient's pancreatic islet cells are no longer viable. It is desirable to administer an anti-IFN-α antibody as early as possible in the development of the immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder, and to continue treatment for as long as is necessary for the protection of healthy tissue from destruction by the patient's immune system. For example, the IDDM patient is treated until insulin monitoring demonstrates adequate islet response and other indicia of islet necrosis diminish (e.g. reduction in anti-islet antibody titers), after which the patient can be withdrawn from anti-IFN-α antibody treatment for a trial period during which insulin response and the level of anti-islet antibodies are monitored for relapse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment and prevention of an immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder by an anti-IFN-α antibody, the antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \"therapeutically effective amount\" of antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the disorder, including treating chronic autoimmune conditions and immunosuppression maintenance in transplant recipients. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the antibody administered parenterally will be in the range of about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of antibody used being 0.3 to 20 mg/kg/day, more preferably 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. The desired dosage can be delivered by a single bolus administration, by multiple bolus administrations, or by continuous infusion administration of antibody, depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the practitioner wishes to achieve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, however, these suggested amounts of antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained, as indicated above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder in question. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, the antibody may be given in conjunction with a glucocorticosteroid. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of anti-IFN-α antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther details of the invention can be found in the following example, which further defines the scope of the invention. All references cited throughout the specification, and the references cited therein, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.

In particular, Balb/c mice were immunized into each hind footpad 9 times (at two week intervals) with 2.5 :g of lymphoblastoid hIFN-∀ (Product No. I-9887 of Sigma, St. Louis, MO) resuspended in MPL-TDM (Ribi Immunochemical Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT). Three days after the final boost, popliteal lymph node cells were fused with murine myeloma cells P3X63Ag8.U.1 (ATCC CRL1597), using 35% polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas were selected in HAT medium. Ten days after the fusion, hybridoma culture supernatants were first screened for mAbs binding to the various species of hIFN-α in an ELISA. The selected hybridoma culture supernatants were then tested for their ability to inhibit the anti-viral cytophathic effect of IFN on human lung carcinoma cell line A549 cells as described below. As indicated in \nFig. 1\n, three mAbs obtained from 1794 fusion wells were able to neutralize a diverse set of IFN-subtypes. These three mAbs were subcloned and re-analyzed.\n\n\n \n \nNeutralization of antiviral activity of\n IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a candidate antibody to neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-α was assayed as described by \nYousefi, S., et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol., 83: 735-740 (1985\n). Briefly, the assay was performed using human lung carcinoma A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with various units of type I interferons for one hour at 37EC in a total volume of 100 :1. These mixtures were then incubated with 5x10\n5\n A549 cells in 100 :1 of cell culture medium for 24 hours. Cells were then challenged with 2x10\n5\n pfu of EMC virus for an additional 24 hours. At the end of the incubation, cell viability was determined by visual microscopic examination or crystal violet staining. The neutralizing antibody titer (EC50) was defined as the concentration of antibody which neutralizes 50% of the anti-viral cytopathic effect by 100 units/ml of type I IFNs. The units of type I IFNs used in this study were determined using NIH reference recombinant human IFN-∀2 as a standard. The specific activities of the various type I IFNs tested were as follows: IFN-∀2/-∀1 (IFN-∀2 residues 1-62/-∀1 residues 64-166) (2x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀1 (3x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀2 (2x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀5 (8x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀8 (19x10\n7\n IU/mg), and IFN-∀10 (1.5x10\n5\n IU/mg). The leukocyte IFN tested was Sigma Product No. I-2396. The lymphoblastoid IFN tested was NIH reference standard Ga23-901-532. The data shown in \nFig. 3B\n was obtained using the above-described assay format in experiments performed by Access Biomedical (San Diego, CA) at the behest of applicant.\n\n\n \n\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMost of the immediate actions of IFN have been linked to activation of latent cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins to produce a multiprotein complex, interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3), which induces transcription from target promoter interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). ISGF3 is composed of three protein subunits: STAT1, STAT2 and p48/ISGF3γ. The p48 protein belongs to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, and is a DNA-binding protein that directly interacts with ISRE. Thus, monitoring ISRE specific cellular DNA-binding complex in response to IFN treatment provides a simple, rapid and convenient method to assess the effect of IFN on target cells. One of the convenient formats to carry out such an analysis is electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), wherein the induction of an ISRE-binding activity by IFN treatment results in the shift in the electrophoretic mobility of a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the consensus sequence of ISRE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay was carried out essentially as described by \nKurabayashi et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 15: 6386 (1995\n). Briefly, 5 ng of a specific IFN-α subtype plus various concentrations (5-100 µg/ml) of anti-IFN-α mAbs were incubated with 5x10\n5\n HeLa cells in 200 µl of DMEM for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were preincubated with antibody for 15 minutes at 4°C before the addition of the hIFN-∀. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 125 µl buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM ETDA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin). After a 15 minute incubation on ice, cells were lysed by the addition of 0.025% NP40. The nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation and was resuspended in 50 µl buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, I mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 30 min. The nuclear fraction was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant stored at - 70°C until use. Double-stranded probes were prepared from single-stranded oligonucleotides (ISG15 top : 5'-GATCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3' [SEQ ID NO. 13], ISG15 bottom: 5'-GATCGGCTTCAGTTTCGGTTTCCCTTTC CC-3' [SEQ ID NO. 14]) utilizing a DNA polymerase I Klenow filling reaction with \n32\nP- dATP (3,000 Ci/mM, Amersham). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified from unincorporated radioactive nucleotides using BIO-Spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad). Binding reactions containing 5 µl nuclear extract, 25,000 cpm of labeled probe and 2 µg of non-specific competitor poly (dI-dC)-poly (dI-dC) in 15 µl binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 15% glycerol) were incubated at RT for 30 minutes. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiograph. The specificity of the assay was determined by the addition of 350 ng of unlabeled ISG15 probe in separate reaction mixtures. Formation of an ISGF3 specific complex was confirmed by a super shift assay with anti-STAT 1 antibody.\n\n\n \n \nCloning of a gene encoding 9F3 anti-\nIFN-α \nmonoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe murine anti-human IFN-α mAb 9F3 was generated, cloned and sequenced. The plasmid pEMX1 used for expression and mutagenesis of F(ab)s in \nE. coli\n has been described previously (\nWerther et al., J. Immunol. 157: 4986-4995 [1996\n]). Briefly, the plasmid contains a DNA fragment encoding a consensus \nhuman κ subgroup\n 1 light chain (VLκl-CL) and a consensus human subgroup III heavy chain (VHIII-CH1) and an alkaline phosphatase promoter. The use of the consensus sequences for VL and VH has been described previously (\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285-4289 [1992\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have previously shown that there is a wide spectrum of IFN-α subtypes expressed by the islets of patients with IDDM (\nHuang et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]). We also demonstrated that there is no obvious association between IDDM and the expression of either IFN-β or IFN-γ (Huang \net al.,\n [1995] \nsupra).\n While the specific IFN-α subtypes expressed as part of the SLE pathology have not been defined, as with IDDM, the association is with IFN-α and not with either of IFN-β or IFN-γ (\nHooks, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 25: 396-400 [1982\n]; \nKim, et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 70: 562-569 [1987\n]; \nLacki, et al., J. Med. 28: 99-107 [1997\n]; \nRobak, et al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis 46: 375-380 [1998\n]; \nShiozawa, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 35: 417-422 [1992\n]; \nvon Wussow, et al., Rheumatology International 8: 225-230 [1988\n]). These observations led us to propose that a candidate antibody for therapeutic intervention in IDDM, or SLE would need to neutralize a majority of the IFN-α subtypes while leaving intact the activities of other interferons (β, γ and ω) and interleukins that may be required for host defense.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of them (9F3) was able to neutralize a wide spectrum of recombinant interferon α subtypes and was further characterized. As shown in \nFig. 2A\n, 9F3 was able to neutralize the anti-viral activity of seven recombinant interferons, IFN-α - 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 (\nFig. 2\n) and IFN-\nα\n 1 and 21 (Table 2 and \nFig. 6\n). These IFN-α subtypes cover the full spectrum of sequences as projected in a type I interferon sequence dendrogram. More importantly, the 9F3 mAb that neutralized the IFN-α subtypes was unable to neutralize IFN-β (\nFig. 2\n, Table 2) or IFN-(. The small increase in activity shown in \nFig. 2\n for IFN-β was not reproducible in other assays and appears to be the result of assay variation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther mAbs that are neutralizing toward IFN-α have been developed (\nTsukui et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 30: 1129-1139 [1986\n]; \nBerg, J. Interferon Res. 4: 481-491 [1984\n]; \nMeager and Berg, J. Interferon Res. 6:729-736 [1986\n]; \n \nUS Patent No. 4,902,618\n \n; and \n \nEP publication No. 0,139,676 B1\n \n). However, these antibodies neutralize only a limited number of recombinant IFN-α subtypes and are unable to neutralize a wide spectrum of IFN-α subtypes such as those produced by activated leukocytes. In contrast, 9F3 Mab was able to neutralize at least 95% of the anti-viral activity in the heterogeneous collection of IFN-α subtypes produced by activated leukocytes (\nFig. 3A\n). Similarly, 9F3 mAb was also able to block the anti-viral activity of an independent preparation of lymphoblastoid IFN (NIH reference standard) as determined in an independent experiment (\nFig. 3B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of 9F3 mAb to neutralize IFN-α was also tested using an alternative bioassay. The assay was based on the ability of IFN-α to activate the binding of the signaling molecule, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), to an oligonucleotide derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in a DNA binding assay known as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (\nHorvath et al., Genes Dev. 9: 984-994 [1995\n]). The transduction of type I interferon signals to the nucleus relies on activation of a protein complex, ISGF3, involving two signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, STAT1 and STAT2, and the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) protein, p48/ISGF3γ (\nWathelet et al., Mol. Cell 1: 507-518 [1998\n]). The latter is a DNA sequence recognition subunit of ISGF3 and directly interacts with ISRE (\nMcKendry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 11455-11459 [1991\n]; \nJohn et al., Mol. Cell. Biol 11: 4189-4195 [1991\n]). The treatment of COS cells with either IFN-α or IFN-β led to the appearance of a complex corresponding to the binding of ISGF3 to the ISRE derived probe. The appearance of the IFN-α-induced but not the IFN-β-induced complex was blocked by 9F3 mAb (\nFig. 4\n). Furthermore, 9F3 mAb was able to neutralize the activity of six recombinant IFN-α subtypes that were tested in this assay (Table 2).\n\n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of ISGF3 formation induced by type I IFNs by mAb 9F3\n \n \n \nmAb\n \nIFN-α2/1\n \nIFN-α1\n \nIFN-α2\n \nIFN-α5\n \nIFN-α8\n \nIFN-α21\n \nIFN-β\n \n \n \n \n9F3.18.5\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n+\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n-\n \n \n \nIgG1\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extent of inhibition of the IFN induced complex by 9F3 is indicated where - indicates that the induced band was not altered; + indicates that the band was partially lost and +++ indicates that the induced band was largely abolished. mAb was used at 10 µg/ml; IFN-α was used at 25 ng/ml\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving established that 9F3 was able to neutralize both a wide variety of recombinant IFN-α subtypes and the mixture of IFN-α subtypes produced by activated leukocytes, we cloned and sequenced the cDNAs encoding both the heavy and light chains of 9F3 mAb. The heavy and light chains were purified and the N terminal amino acid sequences derived were used to design degenerate 5' primers corresponding to the N terminus, and the 3' primers were designed corresponding to the constant domain of mouse κ light chain and IgG2 heavy chain. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned using conventional PCR technique and the nucleotide sequence of the inserts was determined. \nFigure 5\n shows sequence alignment of VL (5A) and VH (5B) domains of a murine 9F3 monoclonal antibody, a humanized version (V13) and consensus sequence of the human heavy chain subgroup III and the human κ light chain subgroup III. In order to ensure that the cDNAs that were cloned encoded the correct Mab reflecting the specificity and characteristics of 9F3 mAb, recombinant chimeric proteins were generated that utilized the mouse cDNA sequences shown in \nFig. 5\n and a human CH1 domain. The resultant chimera (CH8-2) was able to fully neutralize various recombinant IFN-α subtypes (\nFig. 6\n). The amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chains were then used to generate a humanized antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 2. \nHumanization of 9F3 pan-IFN-α neutralizing monoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of Humanized F(ab)s\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo construct the first F(ab) variant of humanized 9F3, site-directed mutagenesis (\nKunkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488-492 [1985\n]) was performed on a deoxyuridine-containing template of pEMX1. The six CDRs were changed to the murine 9F3 sequence (\nFig. 5\n); the residues included in each CDR were from the sequence-based CDR definitions (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra).\n F-1 therefore consisted of a complete human framework (\nVL κ subgroup\n 1 and VH subgroup III) with the six complete murine CDR sequences. Plasmids for all other F(ab) variants were constructed from the plasmid template of F-1. Plasmids were transformed into \nE. coli\n strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) for preparation of double- and single-stranded DNA using commercial kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each variant, DNA coding for light and heavy chains was completely sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Plasmids were transformed into \nE. coli\n strain 16C9, a derivative of MM294, plated onto Luria broth plates containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin, and a single colony selected for protein expression. The single colony was grown in 5 ml Luria broth-100 µg/ml carbenicillin for 5-8 h at 37°C. The 5 ml culture was added to 500 ml AP5 medium containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin and allowed to grow for 20 h in a 4 L baffled shake flask at 30°C. AP5 medium consists of: 1.5 g glucose, 11.0 g Hycase SF, 0.6 g yeast extract (certified), 0.19 g MgSO\n4\n (anhydrous), 1.07 g NH\n4\nCl, 3.73 g KCI, 1.2 g NaCl, 120 ml 1 M triethanolamine, pH 7.4, to 1 L water and then sterile filtered through 0.1 µm Sealkeen filter. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in a 1 L centrifuge bottle at 3000xg and the supernatant removed. After freezing for 1 h, the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml cold 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA-20% sucrose, pH 7.5, 250 µl of 0.1 M benzamidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to inhibit proteolysis. After gentle stirring on ice for 3 h, the sample was centrifuged at 40,000xg for 15 min. The supernatant was then applied to a Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column (0.5 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 10 ml of 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and eluted with 3 ml 0.3 M glycine, pH 3.0, into 1.25 ml 1 M Tris, pH 8.0. The F(ab) was then buffer exchanged into PBS using a Centricon-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml. SDS-PAGE gels of all F(ab)s were run to ascertain purity and the molecular weight of each variant was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. F(ab) concentrations were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction of Chimeric and Humanized 1gG\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor generation of human IgG2 versions of chimeric and humanized 9F3, the appropriate murine or humanized VL and VH (F-13, Table 3) domains were subcloned into separate previously described pRK vectors (\nEaton et al., Biochemistry 25: 8343-8347 [1986\n]) that contained DNA coding for human IgG2 CH1-Fc or human light chain CL domain. The DNA coding for the entire light and the entire heavy chain of each variant was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The chimeric IgG consists of the entire murine 9F3 VH domain fused to a human CH1 domain at amino acid SerH113 and the entire murine 9F3 VL domain fused to a human CL domain at amino acid LysL 107.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into an adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line, 293 (\nGraham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36: 59-74 [1977\n]), using a high efficiency procedure (\nGorman et al., DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 2: 3-10 [1990\n]). Media was changed to serum-free and harvested daily for up to five days. Antibodies were purified from the pooled supernatants using Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The eluted antibody was buffer exchanged into PBS using a Centricon-30 (Amicon), concentrated to 0.5 ml, sterile filtered using a Millex-GV (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4°C. IgG2 concentrations were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nIFN-α Binding Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the ELISA, 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated by adding 50 µl of 0.1 µg/ml IFN-α in PBS to each well and incubated at 4°C overnight. The plates were then washed three times with wash buffer (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20). The wells in microtiter plates were then blocked with 200 µl of SuperBlock (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were then washed again three times with wash buffer. After washing step, 100 µl of serial dilutions of humanized mAb starting at 10 µg/ml were added to designated wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour on a shaker apparatus and then washed three times with wash buffer. Next, 100 µl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human Fab specific (Cappel), diluted at 1:1000 in assay buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS), was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature on a shaker apparatus and then washed three times with wash buffer, followed by addition of 100 µl of substrate (TMB, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine; Kirkegaard & Perry) to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of stop solution (from Kirkegaard & Perry) to each well, and absorbance at 450 nm was read in an automated microtiter plate reader.\n\n\n \n \nBIAcore\n™ \nBiosensor Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIFN-α binding of the humanized F(ab)s, chimeric and humanized IgG2 antibodies were measured using a BIACore™ biosensor (\nKarlsson et al., Methods: A. companion to Methods in Enzymology 6: 97-108 [1994\n]). The IFN-α was immobilized on the sensor chip at 60 µg/ml in 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.3. Antibodies were exposed to the chip at 75 µg/ml (500 nM) in phosphate-buffered saline/1% Tween-20. The antibody on-rate (k\non\n) was measured.\n\n\n \n\n\nComputer Graphics Modes of Murine and Humanized F(ab)s\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSequences of the VL and VH domains (\nFig. 5A\n and \nB\n) were used to construct a computer graphics model of the murine 9F3 VL-VH domains (\nFig. 7\n). This model was used to determine which framework residues should be incorporated into the humanized antibody. A model of the humanized F(ab) was also constructed to verify correct selection of murine framework residues. Construction of models was performed as described previously (Carter \net al.,\n [1992] \nsupra;\n Werther \net al.,\n [1996] \nsupra\n)\n.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe consensus sequence for the human heavy chain subgroup III and the light chain subgroup I were used as the framework for the humanization as shown in \nFig. 5\n (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991), \nsupra).\n This framework has been successfully used in the humanization of other murine antibodies (\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285-4289 [1992\n]; \nPresta et al., J. Immunol. 151: 2623-2632 [1993\n]; \nEigenbrot et al., Proteins 18: 49-62 [1994\n]; \nWerther et al., J. Immunol. 157: 4986-4995 [1996\n]). All humanized variants were initially made and screened for binding as F(ab)s expressed in \nE. coli.\n Typical yields from 500 ml shake flasks were 0.1-0.4 mg F(ab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complementarity determining region (CDR) residues have been defined either based on sequence hypervariability (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra)\n or crystal structure of F(ab)-antigen complexes (\nChothia et al., Nature 342: 877-883 [1989\n]). Although the sequence-based CDRs are larger than the structure-based CDRs, the two definitions are generally in agreement except for CDR-H1. According to the sequence-based definition, CDR-H1 includes residues H31-H35, whereas the structure-based system defines residues H26-H32 as CDR-H1 (light chain residue numbers are prefixed with L; heavy chain residue numbers are prefixed with H). For the present study, CDR-H1 was defined as a combination of the two, i.e. including residues H26-H35. The other CDRs were defined using the sequence-based definition (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the initial variant, F-1, the CDR residues were transferred from the murine antibody to the human framework. In addition, F(ab)s which consisted of the chimeric heavy chain with F-1 light chain (Ch-1) and F-1 heavy chain with chimeric light chain (Ch-2) were generated and tested for binding. F-1 bound IFN-α poorly (Table 3). Comparing the binding affinities of Ch-1 and Ch-2 (Table 3) suggested that framework residues in the F-1 VH domain needed to be altered in order to increase binding.\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \nHumanized Anti-IFN-α Versions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOD\n450nm\n at 10 µg/ml\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVersion\n \nTemplate\n \nChanges\na\n \n \nMean\n \nSD\n \nN\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCh-1\n \nF-1 VL/ Murine VH\n \n \n \n1.45\n \n0.11\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nCh-2\n \nMurine VL/ F-2 VH\n \n \n \n.024\n \n0.04\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-1\n \nHuman FR/ CDR swap\n \n \n \n0.06\n \n0.00\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-2\n \nF-1\n \nArgH71Leu; AsnH73Lys\n \n0.08\n \n0.01\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-3\n \nF-2\n \nPheH67A1a; I1eH69Leu; LeuH78A1a\n \n0.14\n \n0.02\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-4\n \nF-3\n \nArgH94Ser\n \n0.495\n \n0.02\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-5\n \nF-4\n \nAlaH24Thr\n \n0.545\n \n0.03\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-6\n \nF-5\n \nValH48I1e; AlaH49Gly\n \n0.527\n \n0.02\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF\n-\n7\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \nA1aH78Leu\n \n \n0.259\n \n0.02\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-8\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \nLeuH69Il\ne\n \n0.523\n \n0.05\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-9\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \nA1aH67Phe\n \n \n0.675\n \n0.09\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-10\n \n \n \nF-9\n \n \n \nLeuH69Ile\n \n \n0.690\n \n0.03\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-11\n \nF-10\n \nLysH75Ser\n \n0.642\n \n0.06\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-12\n \nF-10\n \nAsnH76Arg\n \n0.912\n \n0.05\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nF-13\n \nF-12\n \nLeuL46Val\n\nTyrL49Ser\n \n1.050\n \n0.16\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-14\n \n \n \nF-13\n \n \n \nLeuH71Arg\n \n \n0.472\n \n0.06\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-15\n \n \n \nF-13\n \n \n \nLysH73Asn\n \n \n0.868\n \n0.32\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nMurine residues are in bold; residue numbers are according to Kabat et al. (1991). Standard text indicates a change from a human framework residue to mouse. Italic text indicates a change from a mouse framework residue to human. Fab binding to IFN-α was assayed by ELISA and results are provided as OD\n450 nm\n at 10 µg/ml. SD, standard deviation; n, number of experimental replicates.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious humanizations (\nXiang et al., J. Mol. Biol. 253: 385-390 [1995\n]; Werther et \nal.,\n [1996] \nsupra)\n as well as studies of F(ab)-antigen crystal structures (Chothia \net al.,\n [1989] \nsupra;\n \nTramontano et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 175-182 [1990\n]) have shown that residues H71 and H73 can have a profound effect on binding, possibly by influencing the conformations of CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. Changing the human residues at positions H71 and H73 to their murine counterparts improved binding only slightly (version F-2, Table 3). Further simultaneous changes at positions H67, H69 and H78 (version F-3) followed by changes ArgH94Ser (version F-4) and AlaH24Thr (version F-5) significantly improved binding (Table 3). Since positions H67, H69 and H78 had been changed simultaneously, each was individually altered back to the human consensus framework residue; versions F-7, F-8, F-9, and F-10 show that the human residue is preferred at position H67, position H69 does not show any preference for the human or murine residue, and the murine residue is preferred at position H78.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have found during previous humanizations that residues in a framework loop, FR-3 (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra),\n adjacent to CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 can affect binding (Eigenbrot \net al.,\n (1994) \nsupra).\n Accordingly, two residues in this loop were changed to their murine counterparts: LysH75 to murine Ser (version F-11) and AsnH76 to murine Arg (version F-12). Only the AsnH76Arg change effected an improvement in binding (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInspection of the models of the murine and humanized F(ab)s suggested that residue L46, buried at the VL-VH interface and interacting with CDR-H3, might also play a role either in determining the conformation of CDR-H3 and/or affecting the interactions between the VL and VH domains. Similarly, L49 position which is adjacent to CDR-L2 differs between the human consensus (Tyr) and the 9F3 (Ser) sequence. Therefore, LeuL46Val and TyrL49Ser residues were simultaneously substituted, which resulted in a variant (F-13) with further improvement in the binding (Table 3). Based on its best binding among all the variants generated, F-13 was chosen as the final humanized version.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA humanized recombinant anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody (V13IgG2) was generated by fusing VH and VL domains derived from F-13 to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and human CL domains respectively. The K\nON\n rates and K\nD\n values of V13IgG2 were then compared with a chimeric IgG2 or murine 9F3. BIACore™ measurement of V13IgG2 and chimeric IgG2 binding to immobilized IFN-α showed that their K\nON\n rates were similar (Table 4). Affinity measurement using Kinexa™ technology showed that the affinity of V13IgG2 for IFNα was reduced by 2-fold compared to the parental murine 9F3 antibody (Table 4).\n\n \n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \nBIACore™ and Kinexa™ Data for Anti-IFNα Antibodies\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\na\n \n \nK\non\n(µM/sec)\n \nKd(nM)\nb\n \n \nMethod\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.9\n \n0.14\n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nChIgG2\n \n3.9\n \n \n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nV13IgG2\n \n3.3\n \n \n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nV13Fab\n \n \n \n4.1\n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\na\n \n \nK\nD\n(pM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmurine 9F3\n \n1.5\n \n \n \nKinexa™\n \n \n \nV 13Fab\n \n3.4\n \n \n \nKinexa™\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nV13IgG2 is F-13 VH domain joined to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and F-13 VL domain joined to a human CL domain; ChIgG2 is mouse 9F3 VH domain joined to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and mouse 9F3 VL domain joined to human CL domain. \nb\nKoff/Kon.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nDeposit of Material\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following materials have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, VA 20110-2209, USA (ATCC):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMaterial\n \nATCC Dep.

Equol can bind circulating free DHT and sequester it from the androgen receptor, thus altering growth and physiological hormone responses that are regulated by androgens. These data suggest a novel model to explain equol's biological properties. The significance of equol's ability to specifically bind and sequester DHT from the androgen receptor have important ramifications in health and disease and may indicate a broad and important usage for equol in the treatment and prevention of androgen-mediated pathologies of skin and hair. Thus, equol can specifically bind DHT and prevent DHT's biological actions in physiological and pathophysiological processes affecting skin and hair.

There are three main classifications of phytoestrogens: 1) isoflavones (derived principally from soybeans), 2) lignans (found in flaxseed in large quantities) and 3) coumestans (derived from sprouting plants like alfalfa). Of these three main classifications, human consumption of isoflavones has the largest impact due to its availability and variety in food products containing soy. Of the isoflavones, genistein and daidzein are thought to exert the most potent estrogenic hormone activity and thus most attention has been directed toward these molecules (\nKnight et al, Obstet Gyneco, 187:897-904, (1996\n); \nSetchell, KDR. Am J Clin Nutr, 129:1333S-1346S (1998\n); \nKurzer et al, Annu Rev Nutr, 17:353-381(1997\n)). However, these isoflavone molecules do not exist at high levels in their biologically active form in soy foods, but rather are at high abundance in a precursor form. For example, genistin, the precursor of genistein, is the glycosidic form that contains a carbohydrate portion of the molecule. Additionally, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside forms also are found. These conjugates are metabolized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by intestinal bacteria, which hydrolyze the carbohydrate moiety to the biologically active phytoestrogen, genistein. The same metabolic step occurs for the aglycone daidzein, which is converted from the glycosidic form daidzin. Diadzein is then further metabolized to equol in an \"equol-producing\" mammal, which is then found in the plasma of an equol-producing individual. Equol is not normally present in the urine of most healthy human adults unless soy is consumed. The formation of equol in vivo is exclusively dependent on intestinal microflora as evidenced from the finding that germ-free and phytoestrogen-free fed animals do not excrete equol when fed soy, and that equol is not found in the plasma and urine of human newborn or 4-month old infants fed exclusively soy foods from birth due to the fact that the intestinal flora has not yet developed in neonates. (See \nSetchell et al, The Lancet 1997; 350:23-27\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenolic ring structures of isoflavones enable these compounds to bind estrogen receptors (ER) and mimic estrogen. Although genistein and daidzein bind to ER, it is with a lower affinity when compared to estradiol, and with a greater affinity for ERβ than to ERα. Thus isoflavones, like genistein and the metabolite S-equol, act like natural selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) at various tissue sites throughout the body. In some tissues, there is evidence that phytoestrogens act as estrogen agonists, whereas in others, they display antagonistic characteristics comparable to that of tamoxifen or raloxifene where SERM activity appears to be sex-hormone- and gender-dependent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the bulk of the scientific literature has focused on the natural isoflavones in soy or clover, little has been reported on the actions or effects of their intestinally derived metabolites. Equol (7-hydroxy-3(4'hydroxyphenyl)-chroman) represents the major metabolite of the phytoestrogen daidzin, one of the main isoflavones found abundantly in soybeans and soy-foods. Equol, however, is not a phytoestrogen, because it is not a natural constituent of plants. Equol does not occur naturally in any plant-based products. Rather, it is a non-steroidal isoflavone that is exclusively a product of intestinal bacterial metabolism, however, only about 30-40% of humans have the microflora necessary to convert soy isoflavones to equol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious research with equol has identified that equol possesses some weak estrogenic properties, binds sex hormone binding globulin and α-fetoprotein, and has antioxidant activity. The S-enantiomer of equol (S-)-equol) is the exclusive equol form found in the urine and plasma of \"equol-producing\" mammals consuming soy, and is the only equol enantiomer made by human intestinal bacteria. The R- and S- enantiomers conformationally differ, which subsequently influences their biological activity. For example, only the S-enantiomer of equol binds estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes with sufficient affinity to be relevant to usual circulating equol levels reported in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prostate gland depends on androgen hormone action for its development and growth, and the development of human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) clearly requires a combination of testicular androgens during the aging process. However, testosterone is not the major androgen responsible for growth of the prostate. The principal prostatic androgen is 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), as evidenced by current treatments of prostatic cancer, which are directed toward reducing 5α-DHT with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Although not elevated in human BPH, 5α-DHT levels in the prostate remain at a constant with aging, despite a decrease in the plasma testosterone concentration. Testosterone is converted to 5α-DHT by 5α-reductase in prostatic stromal and basal cells. 5α-DHT is primarily responsible for prostate development and the pathogenesis of BPH. Inhibitors of 5α-reductase reduce prostate size by 20% to 30%. This reduction in glandular tissue is achieved by the induction of apoptosis, which is histologically manifested by ductal atrophy. 5α-reductase occurs as 2 isoforms, \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2, with the prostate expressing predominantly the type-2 isoform, and the liver and skin expressing primarily the type-1 isoform. Patients have been identified with deficiencies in the type-2 5α-reductase, but not \ntype\n 1. Gene-targeted knockout mice with the type-2 5α-reductase null-mutation demonstrate a phenotype similar to that seen in men with 5α-reductase deficiency. Type-1 5α-reductase knockout male mice are phenotypically normal with respect to reproductive function. Enzymatic activity for 5α-reductase or immunohistochemical detection has been noted in other genitourinary tissues, such as the epididymis, testes, gubernaculum, and corporal cavernosal tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQuantitatively, women secrete greater amounts of androgen than that of estrogen due to the greater adrenal cortical responsiveness by gender. The major circulating steroids generally classified as androgens include dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (originating from the adrenal cortex), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), and 5α-DHT in descending order of serum concentration, though only the latter two bind the androgen receptor to a significant degree. The other three steroids are better considered as pro-androgens. 5α DHT is primarily a peripheral product of testosterone metabolism. Testosterone circulates both in its free form, and bound to protein including albumin and sex steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the levels of which are an important determinant of free testosterone concentration. The postmenopausal ovary is an androgen-secreting organ and the levels of testosterone are not directly influenced by the menopausal transition or the occurrence of menopause.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe work of some research has focused on the development of steroidal compounds for the treatment of androgen dependent diseases such as: hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. DHT has been implicated as a causative factor in the progression of these diseases, largely through the clinical evaluation of males who are genetically deficient of steroid 5α-reductase enzyme. As a result of such studies, the inhibition of this enzyme has become a pharmacological strategy for the design and synthesis of new antiandrogenic drugs. However, it is unclear whether inhibition of 5α-reductase will have a deleterious impact on the system, as evidenced by contraindications arising from reported side effects of conventional treatments using 5α-reducatse inhibitors, such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory disorders. The development of different strategies that target the inhibition of DHT effects would be a major advance in the therapy of androgen-mediated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the recent gains in understanding the pharmacology of equol as it pertains to estrogen actions, our research showing potent antiandrogen effects of equol is unique and novel and opens new approaches to preventing or treating androgen-related conditions. Binding or sequestering 5α-DHT would provide a means for inhibiting its effect on 5α-DHT-sensitive tissues. There is no known ligand that is specific for 5α-DHT, but such an agent would have distinct advantages over non-discriminatory compounds that target the androgen receptor directly or the enzymes involved in androgen synthesis.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a method of co-mediating androgen hormone action and estrogen hormone action, that ameliorate one or more physiological and pathophysiological conditions/disorders of the skin in human and non-human species, by administering an enantiomeric equol comprising S-equol, in an amount sufficient to bind free 5α-dihydrotestosterone, thereby inhibiting its binding with androgen receptors, and to bind estrogen receptor subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a method of mediating androgen hormones action that ameliorates one or more physiological and pathophysiological conditions/disorders of the skin in human and non-human species, by administering an enantiomeric equol comprising R-equol, in an amount sufficient to bind free 5α-dihydrotestosterone and inhibit its binding with androgen receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further relates to a method of treating and preventing androgen-related diseases mediated by androgen hormone action, by administering an enantiomeric equol comprising S-equol, in an amount sufficient to bind free 5α-dihydrotestosterone, thereby inhibiting its binding with androgen receptors, and to bind estrogen receptor subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention can also relate to a method of treating and preventing androgen-related diseases mediated by androgen hormone action, by administering an enantiomeric equol comprising R-equol, in an amount sufficient to bind free 5α-dihydrotestosterone and inhibit its binding with androgen receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a use of an enantiomer of equol comprising S-equol, for treating and preventing androgen-related diseases mediated by androgen hormone action, by administering an enantiomeric equol comprising S-equol, in an amount sufficient to bind free 5α-dihydrotestosterone and inhibit its binding with androgen receptors, and to bind estrogen receptor subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a method of providing a personalized treatment of one or more physiological and pathophysiological conditions/disorders of the skin in human and non-human species, mediated both by DHT and the estrogen receptors, comprising: 1) assessing the one or more disease states or conditions of a patient;

Furthermore, the term \"skin\" as used herein encompasses tissues of the mucous membranes extending from the adjoining skin, such as the mouth and oral cavity, nose and nasal passages, eyes and eyelids, ears and outer ear canals, and the perineum and tissues of the anal and urogenital orifices\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"affected area\" refers to a region of the skin that is to be treated with a therapeutic molecule or compound containing a therapeutic molecule. The affected area may be the site of a skin condition or disease for which treatment is sought. In some cases, the affected area may encompass all skin on an individual. Alternatively, the affected area may be a site for which improvement of a cosmetic nature is sought, and can also include all skin on an individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"systemic\" or \"systemically\" refers to a mode of administration of a therapy that reaches an affected area of skin via the blood stream or lymphatic system. Examples of a systemic treatment include, but are not limited to, oral gavage or ingestion, intravenous or subdermal pump infusion, and injection via intramuscular, intraperitoneal, hypodermic or subdermic injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"topical\" or \"topically\" refers to a mode of administration that is applied directly to an affected area of the skin. Examples of a topical treatment include, but are not limited to application of cream, lotion, shampoo, conditioning lotion, spray, a pad, a bandage, a diaper, a proistened towelette, or transdermal patch; and local administration via intracutaneous injection or introduction of a lozenge or suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"skin parameters\" refers to a variety of indicators of skin health, including but not limited to levels qf collagen and elastin production, elastase, skin thickness, blood flow in the skin, skin turgor and moisture content, prevention of collagen and elastin breakdown by matrix metalloproteinases, absence of wrinkles in skin, presence of glycoaminoglycans and hyaluronic acid for normal skin appearance, ability of skin wounds to heal, normal sebaceous gland function, absence of skin age spots or pigmentation dysfunction, skin pore size, skin temperature, and normal growth of hair and nails.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"skin integrity\" refers to the presence of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix that gives skin its ability to stretch and retract to allow movement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol (7-hydroxy-3(4'hydroxyphenyl)-chroman) represents the major metabolite of daidzin and daidzein, isoflavones found abundantly in soybeans and soy-foods, and is an important biologically active molecule. In animals, such as rodents, fed a phytoestrogen-rich diet, the major circulating isoflavone is equol, which accounts for 70-90% of the total circulating isoflavone levels. However, this is not the case in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol is formed following the hydrolysis of the glycoside conjugates of daidzin from soy, and the methoxylated isoflavone formononetin, or its glycosidic conjugates found in clover. Once formed, equol appears to be metabolically inert, undergoing no further biotransformation, save phase II metabolism or a minor degree of additional hydroxylation in the liver. As with daidzein and genistein, the predominant phase II reactions are glucuronidation and, to a lesser extent, sulfation. Following the original discovery that equol's presence in urine was a function of soy food ingestion, it was observed that approximately 50 - 70% of the adult human population did not excrete equol in urine even when challenged daily with soy foods, for reasons that are unclear. Furthermore, even when the pure isoflavone compounds are administered, thereby removing any influence of the food matrix, it has been shown that many people do not convert daidzein to equol. This phenomenon has led to the terminology of a person being an 'equol-producer' or 'non-equol producer' (or 'poor equol-producer') to describe these two distinct populations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCut-off values have been empirically derived permitting assignment of individuals to either of these categories. People who have plasma equol concentrations of less than 10 ng/mL (40 nmol/L) can be classified as 'non-equol producers' and where levels are above 10 ng/mL (40 nmol/L) this defines 'equol producers'. This distinction can also be derived from the levels in urine, an equol producer being someone excreting greater than 1000 nmol/L. Although the excretion of equol is highly variable among individuals there is a large demarcation between those that can produce equol and those that cannot, consistent with a precursor-product relationship in enzyme kinetics catalyzing the reaction. There is consequently an inverse relationship between urinary daidzein and equol levels, and thus far no significant gender differences have been defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mechanism of action for equol has been identified with important ramifications in skin health and disease and which indicates a broad and important usage for equol in the treatment of androgen and/or estrogen mediated pathologies of skin and hair Equol can act as an anti-androgen or estrogen receptor agonist or antagonist. The anti-androgenic properties of equol are unique in that equol does not bind the androgen receptor (AR) but rather, specifically binds 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) with high affinity, thereby preventing 5α-DHT from binding the AR. Furthermore, both the R- and S-enantiomers of equol specifically bind 5α-DHT, sequester 5α-DHT from the AR and block 5α-DHT's actions in physiological processes in vivo. Racemic equol, which constitutes R-equol and S-equol, and R-equol, or S-equol alone, selectively bind 5α-DHT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn mammals, there are two principal androgens, testosterone and its 5α-reduced metabolite, 5α-DHT. 5α-DHT is recognized as the most potent androgen in the mammalian body. The AR, which is encoded by a single-copy gene located on the human X-chromosome, specifically mediates the actions of androgens. Although both testosterone and 5α-DHT bind the AR, certain tissues (i.e. prostate gland, hair follicles, etc.) that are only slightly influenced by testosterone are greatly influenced by 5α-DHT. Furthermore, 5α-DHT has been implicated in a number of diseases and disorders. Because equol specifically binds and prevents the actions of 5α-DHT, there is an indication for a broad and important usage for equol in the treatment of androgen-mediated pathologies of skin and hair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol has a structure similar to the steroidal estrogen estradiol. \nFIGURE 1\n shows the chemical structures of R-equol and S-equol. Equol is unique among the isoflavones in that it possesses a chiral center and as such exists as two distinct enantiomeric forms, the R- and S- enantiomers. The R- and S- enantiomers conformationally differ and this is predicted to influence how an equol enantiomer fits into the binding site in the cavity of the dimerized ER complex, and how it binds with 5α-DHT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 50% of equol circulates in the free or unbound form in humans, and this is considerable greater than the proportion of free daidzein (18.7%) or estradiol (4.6%) in plasma. Since it is the unbound fraction that is available for receptor occupancy, and presumably for binding 5α-DHT, this would effectively contribute to enhancing the overall potency of equol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll known previous studies on equol appear to have been conducted with the racemic form of equol. There has in general been a lack of appreciation that two forms of equol exist or that the enantiomers may behave differently, and to our knowledge no previous study has reported on the specific actions or activity of the individual enantiomers. R- and S-equol specifically bind 5α-dihydrotestone (5α-DHT). Equol racemic, R-equol or S-equol, does not bind the androgen receptor (AR). Compared to 17β-estradiol the relative binding affinities of the R- and S-equol enantiomer for \nERα\n 1/210 and 1/49 less than that of 17β-estradiol, respectively. However, the S-equol enantiomer seems to be largely ERβ-selective with a relatively high affinity for ERβ. Enantiomer S-equol binds ERβ at similar concentrations to that of 17β-estradiol [equol, Kd = 0.7 nM vs. 17β-estradiol, Kd = 0.15 nm], but its preferential affinity for ERβ subtype defines S-equol as a SERM. The R-equol enantiomer binds at approximately 1/100 the affinity, however, if R-equol is present in extremely high concentrations, it does have SERM properties. Thus, S- and R-equol have the capability to selectively bind the most potent circulating androgen, 5α-DHT, and S-equol has sufficient affinity for ERβ to classify it as having SERM properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of both S-equol, the natural metabolite of daidzein, and R-equol to antagonize the actions of the potent androgen-dihydrotestosterone, 5α-DHT opens up opportunities for cosmetic, dietary, nutraceutical, and pharmacological approaches to prevention and treatment of disease where the potent androgen 5α-DHT plays a detrimental role, including, but not restricted to, prostate cancer, obesity, skin diseases, and hair loss. Additionally, the estrogenic actions of S-equol can also be of benefit in treating or preventing BPH and prostate cancer because the combined actions of equol acting at the estrogen receptor level and as an antiandrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR-equol, although not naturally occurring, is of considerable importance because of its ability to modulate androgen-mediated processes in the body. In binding studies, equol enantiomers specifically bind 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), but not testosterone, DHEA or estrogen. By doing so, equol sequesters 5α-DHT from the androgen receptor without directly binding the androgen receptor itself. \nIn vivo\n studies demonstrate that equol treatment of intact male rats significantly decreased prostate and epididymis but not testes weights. In castrated male rats treated with 5α-DHT after administering equol, equol blocked 5α-DHT's trophic effects on the prostate gland and its negative feedback effects on plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol can act as an anti-androgen, by specifically binding 5α-DHT and preventing 5α-DHT from binding to the androgen receptor (AR) without itself binding the AR. Further 5α-DHT that has already been bound to the AR will not be competitively bound by enantiomeric equol. The enantiomeric equol may be brought into contact with the 5α-DHT \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n When the 5α-DHT is to be contacted \nis vivo\n, the equol, may be administered by any route that allows absorption of equol to the blood stream or into the skin when applied topically. Biologically available 5α-DHT is free and unbound by any native ligand prior to binding with equal\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReproductive organs such as the prostate and epididymis are known to be under androgenic control Previous data has shown that before puberty, when circulating androgen levels are very low, rats fed a diet containing high levels of soy-derived isoflavone have prostate weights that are not altered by the consumption of this diet. However, after puberty when androgen levels increase, prostate weights are significantly decreased in phytoestrogen-rich-diet fed rats compared to animals fed a phytoestrogen-free diet. These data are similar to the present finding that equol-treated intact rats display significant decreases in prostate and epididymis weights, without alterations in testes or pituitary weights. Notably, if the prostate and epididymal values are standardized to body weight (per 100 grams) the ratios are still significantly different between equol-treated and control values. Equol also blocked 5α-DHT's androgenic trophic influence on the prostate and epididymis, without significantly altering testosterone levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5α-DHT has negative feedback effects on circulating plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). Equol significantly increases LH levels by binding 5α-DHT and preventing this feedback effect. Equol completely reverses the inhibitory action of 5α-DHT on LH levels in gonadectomized (GDX) males, whereas 5α-DHT plus equol-treated male rats display LH levels similar to that of control values. These data further suggest that equol has the specific ability to bind 5α-DHT, presumably in the blood circulation system, and block the hormonal action of 5α-DHT in suppressing LH production or secretion. Therefore an embodiment of the present invention is a method of modulating LH levels in an individual by contacting the 5α-DHT of the individual with enantiomeric equol. The equol can be administered by any route that allows absorption of equol into the skin or blood stream, with the amount administered in accordance with the nature of the ailment to be treated and size of the individual. In some cases, it may be desirable to provide a combination of both systemic and topical treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnantiomeric equol can be prepared by chemical synthesis, and can be isolated from racemic mixtures, typically using a chiral-phase column, by known means. S-equol can be made with high enantioselectivity using a biological process that employs the equol-producing microorganism associated with metabolism of equol from isoflavones such as daidzein. These means are described in PCT Patent Publication \n \nWO04-009035\n \n, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nTreatment of Disease by Administering S-Equol, R-equol, and Mixtures:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis present invention provides a means for an individual subject to overcome the problem of not being able to produce equol \nin vivo,\n or to supply R-equol in particular, by providing delivery of equol enantiomers, the S-equol or R-equol, racemic or non-racemic mixtures of S-equol and R-equol directly, circumventing the need for intestinal bacteria for its production or for the need to consume soy foods with equol's precursor isoflavones. The delivery of S-equol can also supplement the \nin vivo\n production of S-equol in 'equol-producers', as well as in 'non-equol producers'.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSupplementing the diet of an equol producer with an equol enantiomer or mixture, can provide benefits when the ordinary level of S-equol produced by the equol producer is inadequate because of 1) insufficient consumption of isoflavones to produce equol, 2) antibiotic use that ablates the activity of intestinal bacteria to make equol from precursor isoflavones, or 3) other health factors that impact the level of equol production or absorption, such as short bowel syndrome or surgical construction of an intestinal stoma such as ileostomy. In addition, a supplemental level of equol is believed to provide enhanced effect on the health and well-being of the person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention provides a method for delivering S-equol, R-equol, racemic equol, or non-racemic mixtures of equol, in sufficient amounts to have health benefits toward androgen-related diseases and conditions associated therewith. The anti-androgenic activity of equol can affect a number of tissues throughout the body. In particular, the blocking of androgenic activity of 5α-DHT can be beneficial for the treatment and prevention of: female- and male-pattern baldness, facial and body hair growth (hirsutism), skin health (acne, anti-aging such as wrinkle prevention and repair and anti-photo aging), and skin integrity (collagen and elastin robustness). The method can be a topical administration, a systemic administration, or a combination of topical and systemic administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the concentration of equol applied to an affected area of skin will from 0.01% to 10%. Typically, 0.01% to is effective to induce increased skin integrity, collagen production, elastin production, elastase, skin thickness, blood flow in the skin, skin turgor, skin moisture content, prevention of collagen and elastin breakdown by matrix metalloproteinases, repair and prevention of wrinkles in skin, enhancing glycoaminoglycans and hyaluronic acid for improved skin appearance, wound healing, improvement of scars in skin, decrease oily skin by improving sebaceous gland function, skin age spots and skin lightening, acne, male and female pattern baldness, hirsutism, scalp, facial and body hair health and growth, apocrine (sweat) gland function, inflammation of the skin, immune function in the skin, skin pore size, skin temperature and skin and hair abnormalities in steroid hormone synthesis/hormone action, metabolism of steroids and binding steroid receptors involving androgenic and/or estrogenic effects. In some cases, a higher dose is required due to the presence of a skin condition or disease, or because the patient is a non-equol producer. In this situation, the concentration of topically-applied equol can be up to 10%, topical administration may be performed more frequently, or systemic administration may be used in combination with or in place of topical administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor systemic administration, the amount of composition comprising the equol is administered in an amount sufficient to produce a transient level of enantiomeric equol in the blood plasma of the mammal of at least 5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), more typically at least 10 ng/mL or greater, or transient levels of enantiomeric equol in urine of greater than 1000 nmol/L. Typically, the composition is administered orally in a dose amount of at least about 1 mg, more typically of at least 5 mg, and of up to 200 mg, more typically, up to 50 mg, of enantiomeric equol. Typical plasma concentrations of R-equol in plasma after oral administration of 20 mg of R-equol enantiomer to a healthy adult is shown by the pharmacokinetics of the plasma appearance/disappearance plots of R-equol in \nFIGURE 2\n. A typical level of bioavailability of S-equol in plasma after oral administration of 20 mg of S-equol to a healthy adult is similar to that shown for R-equol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability to deliver R- and/or S-equol in sufficient amounts is believed to provide several advantages over delivery of a racemic mixture of equol. First, the potency of R-equol or S-equol alone would typically be at least twice that of the racemic mixture. Second, the human body only produces S-equol, and therefore, a composition comprising only S-equol represents a \"natural\" product with an ingredient, S-equol, with which the body is familiar. Third, since the R-equol enantiomer has unique properties, a treatment composition comprising only, or substantially only, the R-enantiomer can produce beneficial and/or therapeutic effects. And fourth, administration of R-equol would supplement any endogenous S-equol present and allow for both estrogenic and anti-androgenic actions to occur in the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of enantiomeric equol to treat and prevent diseases and conditions related to male- and female-pattern baldness. 5α-DHT is a known cause of scalp hair loss. An androgen, specifically the principal circulating androgen, testosterone, is converted to the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) (in the hair follicle), and the hormonal action of 5α-DHT on scalp hair follicles cause hair loss. Thus, if the hormonal action of 5α-DHT can be blocked, such as by the use in the present invention of equol to bind 5α-DHT in the circulation (within blood vessels) and within the hair follicle], then scalp hair loss can be decreased or prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of enantiomeric equol to treat and prevent diseases and conditions related facial and body hair. Facial and body hair are regulated by androgens, but oppositely to that of the regulation of scalp hair. Specifically, the more potent androgen, 5α-DHT, increases facial and body hair. 5α-DHT also increases the production of sebum (oil) from the sebaceous gland, which can contribute to an increase in acne. Thus, the binding of 5α-DHT by equol can cause a decrease in facial and body hair and in secretion of sebum (oil), and a reduction or prevention of acne.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of enantiomeric equol to treat and prevent diseases and conditions related to skin effects, skin quality and integrity, skin aging, skin photo-aging, and skin pigmentation and lightening. Estrogens, before but especially after menopause, improve skin health by increasing elastin and collagen content to improve skin characteristics or robustness. Also, when skin is damaged by acne or other skin disruptions (scratches, popping pimples or minor cuts, etc.), the repair mechanism is faster and the skin heals better if estrogen or estrogen-like compounds, such as equol, are present. It is believed that an enantiomeric equol, and particularly S-equol or a mixture of the enantiomers or racemic equol stimulates elastin and collagen, and also can protect against photo-aging. The ability of equol to block the hormone action of 5α-DHT can decrease sebum oil production from the sebaceous gland, which can decrease or eliminate acne. Since S-equol binds estrogen receptor(s) (mainly ERβ), the protective effects of this estrogen-like molecule stimulates elastin and collagen in the skin. Additionally, since equol is a strong antioxidant, it can protect the skin from aging, including photo-aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSex steroid hormones are involved in the regulation of skin development and functions, such as secretions, as well as in some skin pathological disorders. It is well established that the actions of estrogens and androgens hormone are mediated by the presence of their receptors in skin, hair and glands associated with skin. See \nPelletier and Ren, Histol Histopathology, 19: 629-636, 2004\n. For example, androgen receptors (AR) have been localized in most keratinocytes in the epidermis/dermis and AR was seen in approximately 10% of fibroblasts. However, in sebaceous glands, AR is abundant in basal cells and sebocytes. In hair follicles AR expression is restricted to dermal papillar cells. ERβ is highly expressed in the epidermis, sebaceous glands (basal cells and sebocytes) and eccrine sweat glands. In hair follicles, ERβ is widely expressed in dermal papilla cells, inner sheath cells, matrix cells and outer sheath cells including the bulge region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince equol is a metabolite of daidzein and possesses the characteristics of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), where in some cells and tissue sites it acts like an estrogen agonist and in others an estrogen antagonist, it is reasonable to propose that equol can have dual estrogen-like hormone actions at various cells/tissue containing ERβ. It has been established that equol (racemic) has the ability to bind ERβ through its enantiomer S-equol, since R-equol has low affinity for ERa or ERβ. However, both S-equol and R-equol are of considerable importance because of their ability to specifically bind and biologically inactive 5α-DHT that plays a major role in: a) scalp and facial/body hair follicle growth, such as androgenetic alopecia or male-pattern baldness, and hirsutism in women or female-pattern baldness, b) acne and sebaceous gland function, c) wound healing and d) skin disorders such as apocrine gland dysfunction, hidradentitis suppurativa or osmidrosis. Finally, estrogens are known to positively influenced skin parameters, wound healing, hair follicle health, sebaceous and apocrine gland function, epidermal and hair follicle pigmentation, and malignant melanoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstrogen is known to be a major hormonal factor in the maintenance of human skin. It is known to stimulate collagen production in the dermis, increase skin thickness, increase the vascularization of the skin and increase the mitotic activity of the epidermis. See \nBrincat MP, Maturitas, 29:107-117, 2000\n; \nPunnonen R, Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand Suppl, 21: 3-44, 1972\n; \nHasselquist, MB et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 50: 76-82, 1980\n; and \nShah MG and Maibach HI, Am J Clin Dermatol, 2:143-150, 2001\n. Specifically, estrogen is known to be a natural modulator of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), as described by \nPirila E et al., Curr Med Chem, 8:281-294, 2001\n. MMPs are known to break down collagen and elastin. This could be due to environmental (exposure to chemicals, pollution, extreme temperature environments - cold or heat), mechanical (contractions of facial muscles, such as smiling, frowning, smoking or drinking from a straw) or biological aging. These factors are influenced by genetics and the natural processes of aging, wherein the skin becomes thin, wrinkles appear due to the reduction in collagen and especially elastin, and the robust appearance of the skin declines. Estrogen treatment has also been shown to increase the concentrations of glycoaminoglycans (acid mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid) that enhance the water content or moisture of skin and influence skin turgor. See also \nRaine-Fenning NJ et al., Am J Clin Dermatol, 4:371-378,2003\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of S- and R-equol to ameliorate or block the negative effects of cancer therapies that involve estrogen receptors, such as tamoxifen. Tamoxifen treatment has been shown to cause vaginal dryness, which can be ameliorated by equol through its SERM actions. The invention can be used in a similar manner to ameliorate vaginal dryness that accompanies menopause or post-menopause vaginal dryness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of S- and R-equol to block the negative effects of 5α-DHT and decrease MMPs to positively influence skin collagen, elastin, vascularization and skin thickness and skin turgor and slow down the process of environmental, mechanical and biological aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstrogen is important in the rate and quality of wound healing. See \nPirila Eet al., Curr Med Chem, 8:281-294, 2001\n and \nAshcroft GE et aL, Nat Med, 3:1209-1215, 1997\n. It has been demonstrated that ERβ is the predominant estrogen receptor in adult human scalp skin and the pilosebaceous unit (hair follicle) of the skin. See \nThornton MJ et al., Exp Dermatol, 12: 181-190, 2003\n and \nThornton MJ, et al., J Invest Dermatol Symp Proc, 8: 100-103, 2003\n. Furthermore, it has been reported that physiological levels of 5α-DHT depress wound healing by impairing immune function and promoting inflammation. See \nNitsch SM et al., Arch Surg, 139:157-163, 2004\n and \nGilliver SC et al., Thromb Haemost, 90: 978-985, 2003\n. MMPs are also involved in wound healing that are modulated by estrogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R- and S-equol, via its R- and S- enantiomers binding to extracellular and intracelluar 5α-DHT, to biologically inactivate this potent androgen and positively influence wound healing. At the same time a racemic or non-racemic mixture of Rand S-equol, will improve the rate and quality of wound healing via an ERβ hormone-mediated mechanism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA built-in rhythm of activity in scalp hair follicles results in the growth of new hairs and the molting of old ones. This activity is known to be under the influence of steroid hormones. Scalp hair follicle growth is specifically inhibited by 5α-DHT, while at the same time, facial and body hair follicles are stimulated by \n5α-DHT.\n It is known that postmenopausal women experience female-pattern balding patterns due to the loss of ovarian steroid hormones and the increased ratio of androgens/estrogens during, this period, as described by Brincat (see reference above). Postmenopausal women also experience hirsutism, or increased facial and body hair growth, during this period, and with increased androgen production during the pre-menopausal period. Pre-menopausal women also experience hirstutism with increased androgen production. See\n Reed MJ and Franks S, Baillieres Clin Obstet Gynaecol, 2: 581-595, 1988\n. Castrated males, who have low levels of androgens, or humans with genetic 5a-DHT-reductase deficiency do not experience male-pattern baldness (\nTrueb RM, Exp Gerontol, 37: 981-990, 2002\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also known from in \nvitro\n and \nin vivo\n studies that estrogens increase the hair follicle growth or life cycle and stimulate the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in dermal papilla cells that influence blood flow to the hair follicle. See also \nLachgar S et al., J Invest Dermatol Symp Proc, 4: 290-295, 1999\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R- and S-equol_to biologically inactivate the potent androgen 5α-DHT and inhibit the negative effects on scalp hair follicle growth in both men and women. Equol will stimulate hair follicle life cycle and enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in dermal papilla cells to positively influence scalp hair growth. Conversely, R-equol, and/or S-equol can block the hormonal actions of 5α-DHT, and facial and body hair growth will be reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstrogens decrease the size and inhibit sebaceous gland secretion in males and females. See \nPochi PE and Strauss JS, J Invest Dermatol, 62: 191-210, 1974\n and \nLarie F et al., Horm Res, 54: 218-229, 2000\n. ERβ is widely and highly expressed in the sebaceous gland and estrogen hormone action via this receptor apparently reduces oil gland secretion associated with hair follicles. On the other hand, androgen receptors in the sebaceous glands are activated by 5α-DHT. 5α-DHT in the sebaceous gland stimulates oil production that is associated with attracting bacteria and thus the promotion and production of acne.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R- and S-equol to biologically inactivate the potent androgen 5α-DHT and inhibit the production of oil secretion from the sebaceous gland to reduce the incidence of acne. A combination of enantiomers (R-equol and S-equol) will reduce the size and inhibit the production of oil from the sebaceous gland to assist in the amelioration or prevention of acne.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe apocrine gland develops from the outer root sheath of the hair follicle and remains attached to it. Apocrine glands are associated with hairy regions of the body that produce sweat mostly from the armpits and groin region, as described by \nJakubovic HR et al., in Dermatology, Third Edition, Philadelphia, W.B. Saunders, 1992, pp. 69-77\n. Hidradentitis suppurativa and osmidosis are conditions due to inflammation of the large sweat glands associated with the armpits and groin. See \nSato T et al., Br J Dermatol, 139: 806-810, 1998\n. Patients with these disorders have excessive or abnormal odor derived from apocrine sweat (osmidrosis). The condition is more common in females and appears to improve with estrogen and/or antiandrogen treatments, suggesting that these specialized glands are regulated by estrogens and androgens. See also \nOffidani A et al., J Clin Pathol, 52: 829-832, 1999\n. Specifically when androgen hormone action has been examined, high levels of 5α-reductase activity have been detected in the apocrine glands in patients who suffer from excessive or abnormal odor for their apocrine (sweat) glands, and the action of 5α-DHT has been implicated in these conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R- and S-equol can biologically inactivate the potent androgen hormone 5α-DHT and inhibit the production of sweat secretion from apocrine glands and reduce the incidence of hidradentitis and osmidrosis. Concomitantly, in a combination of the ratios of enantiomers (R-equol and S-equol), equol will reduce production of sweat from aprocrine glands to assist in the prevention of hidradentitis and osmidrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral studies have shown that epidermal melanocytes are estrogen responsive. There are several reports of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives causing hyperpigmentation of the face in women, as described by \nWade TR et al., Obstet Gynecol, 52: 233-242,1978\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R- and S-equol to biologically inactivate the potent androgen hormone 5α-DHT and enhance the hormonal action of equol at estrogen receptors. Epidermal melanocytes will be inhibited via the SERM action of equol, and the result will be a skin-lightening effect. Thus, equol can be an effective treatment for age or skin spots, especially on the face and hands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R-equol and S-equol to biologically inactivate the potent androgen hormone 5α-DHT and enhance the hormonal action of equol at estrogen receptors. Hair follicle melanocytes are stimulated via the SERM action of equol, and the result is an enhancement of hair pigmentation. See \nTobin DJ and Bystryn JC, Pigment Cell Res, 9: 304-310, 1996\n; \nThorton MJ, Exp Dermatology, 11: 487-502, 2002\n; and \nOhuchi A et al., in: Third Intercontinental Meeting of Hair Research Societies, Japan, 2001\n. Thus, equol can be an effective treatment for modulating the tone and color of hair follicles and thus change hair pigmentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to the association of hair follicles with the formation of malignant melanomas, the SERM characteristics of equol may influence malignant melanomas in a positive manner. See \nKanda N and Watanabe S, J Invest Dermatol, 117: 274-283, 2001\n; \nRichardson B et al., Br J Cancer, 80: 2025-2033, 1999\n; and \nDurvasula R et al., Climacteric, 5: 1970200, 2002\n. For example, treatment of human metastatic melanoma cell lines incubated with estradiol inhibited the uptake of \n3\nH-thymidine, which was counteracted by the administration of an antiestrogen. Moreover, estradiol can inhibit the invasion of human melanomas cells through the activation of fibronectin. Finally the mean age of presentation of malignant melanoma in women is the early fifties, a time concomitant with the onset of menopause. Melanoma has traditionally been considered to be an estrogen-receptor positive tumor, however recent evidence now refutes this.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of S-equol, or racemic or non-racemic mixtures of R-equol or S-equol to biologically inactivate the potent androgen hormone 5α-DHT and enhance the hormonal action of equol at estrogen receptors. Via the SERM action of equol, the formation of malignant melanomas will be inhibited and hair follicle melanocytes will be stabilized resulting in the prevention and treatment of malignant melanomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of the present invention include the use of equol as a diagnostic agent in androgen-related skin or hair disorders as well as disorders arising from disturbances in estrogenic/androgenic balance. In these embodiments, equol is administered to an individual to bind 5α-DHT and thereby prevent 5α-DHT binding to androgen receptors. The changes in estrogenic balance are then measured or the change in androgen-binding is assessed to diagnose or further elucidate androgen-related anomalies of skin or hair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol has been found to improve skin health by increasing elastin and collagen content to improve skin characteristics or robustness. The mechanism of this action is believed to block the hormone action of 5α-DHT that would in turn decrease oil production from the sebaceous glands to decrease acne and other skin disorders. Since equol, and particularly S-equol, binds estrogen receptor(s), the protective effects of the estrogen-like molecules stimulate production of elastin and collagen in the skin that is thought to be mediated via ER-β. In addition, the antioxidant properties of equol protect against photo-aging and, in general, the aging of the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol can be administered to bind 5α-DHT prior to or along with other therapeutic moieties in order to assess the binding capacity of 5α-DHT with respect to the therapeutic moiety in question. Also, androgen-binding moieties can be administered following administration of equol to assess the efficacy of the androgen-binding moiety to restore androgen activity and balance estrogenic activity in the absence of 5α-DHT binding. Further, equol can be administered in the presence of 5α-DHT-binding moieties in order to displace these naturally occurring or xenobiotic 5α-DHT-binding moieties from 5α-DHT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnantiomeric equol can be orally administered by supplying an oral dosage form of equol, which results in effective absorption of equol to the blood stream. Administration of equol may be made by routes other than oral if desired. For example, it is contemplated that rectal or urethral administration may be used to administer equol for the treatment of enlarged prostate or to prevent prostate enlargement. Additionally, it is contemplated that the active ligand binding site of the equol molecule may be isolated and synthesized for administration, which can provide 5α-DHT binding without the full equol molecule. The dose of the equol molecule or fragment thereof having 5α-DHT-binding abilities is dependent upon the route of administration and the condition to be treated. Based on our \nin vivo\n studies it is apparent that relatively low doses of equol antagonize much higher doses of 5α-DHT, and this may be explained by the marked differences in the binding of equol to serum protein compared with 5α-DHT. The latter circulates mostly bound to proteins, while equol is 50% free. Generally, a dose sufficient to produce a concentration of equol or active fragments thereof in the bloodstream of the recipient of at least about 0.2 mg equol per kg weight of the recipient and preferably at least about 0.5mg/kg. The dose may be increased dramatically without incurring significant dose-limiting side effects to greater than about 10mg/kg. Oral administration can be effected in microencapsulated forms that can provide delayed or sustained release of the medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol can be administered topically, transdermally, and subdermally in a variety of forms, including lotions, ointments, foams (including shaving creams), and sprays, or as an active ingredient on a substrate suitable for topical application, such as a pad, a surgical bandage, an adhesive bandage, a premoistened towellette, an infant or adult incontinent diaper (such as described in \n \nUS Patent 5,525,346\n \n, incorporated herein by reference), a feminine sanitary product, or a transdermal skin patch (such as described in \n \nUS Patent 5,613,958\n \n and \n \n6,071,531\n \n,incorporated herein by reference), electromechanical devices, including micropumps systems (such as described in \n \nUS Patent 5,693,018\n \n and \n \nUS Patent 5,848,991\n \n, incorporated herein by reference), and subdermal implants (such as described in \n \nUS Patent 5,468,501\n \n, incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition useful in the practice of the present invention comprises an at least physiological acceptable quantity of equol that is able to at least partially bind and sequester free 5α-DHT (but not testosterone or DHEA) thereby preventing it binding to the androgen receptor following administration to an individual thereby having important ramifications in health and disease and a broad and important use in the treatment of androgen-mediated pathologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition containing S-equol, R-equol, a racemic equol mixture, or a non-racemic equol mixture, can be made for oral consumption. The composition or a product containing the composition can be a marketed or institutional food product, a pharmaceutical, and an OTC medicament. A food composition can comprise at least 1 mg, and typically up to 200 mg, enantiomeric equol or equol mixtures, per serving. An orally-administered medicament can comprise at least 1 mg, and typically up to 200 mg, enantiomeric equol or equol mixture, per dose. A product for topical application can comprise at least 0.01%, and up to 10%, by weight S-equol, or R-equol, or enantiomeric mixtures. Selected concentration ranges include from about 0.01% to about 3%, from about 0.1% to about 1%, from about 0.1% to about 3%, from about 0.1% to about 5%, from about 0.3% to about 1%, from about 0.3% to about 3%, from about 0.3% to about 5%, from about 0.5% to about 1%, from about 0.5% to about 3%, and from about 0.5% to about 5%. Typically, 0.01% to 1% is an effective concentration range that can be applied at a varity of intervals. In some cases, it is preferred to apply equol in a concentration of up to 5% to treat some pathological conditions or diseases. There are also instances in which a concentration of up to 10% may be required, due to the severity of a condition or disease, or because an individual is a non-equol producer, thus requiring administration of a greater amount of exogenous equol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA topical composition of the present invention can include other cosmetic and pharmaceutical actives and excipients. Such suitable cosmetic and pharmaceutical agents include, but are not limited to, antifungals, vitamins, anti-inflammatory agents, antimicrobials, analgesics, nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, insect repellents, self-tanning agents, surfactants, moisturizers, stabilizers, preservatives, antiseptics, thickeners, lubricants, humectants, chelating agents, skin penetration enhancers, emollients, fragrances and colorants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some individuals it is preferred to use a combination of systemic and topical administration. This can be due to the severity of the condition or disease, or because an individual is a non-equol producer, thus requiring administration of a greater amount of exogenous equol\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn enantiomeric equol can also be an enantiomeric equol conjugate, conjugated at the C-4' or the C-7 position with a conjugate selected from the group consisting of glucuronide, sulfate, acetate, propionate, glucoside, acetyl-glucoside, malonylglucoside, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition or preparation comprising enantiomeric or mixture of equol, for administering to subjects for the treatment and/or prevention of, or for reducing the predisposition to, androgen-related diseases and conditions related thereto, can also comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, carriers and/or excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, carriers and/or excipients are well known in the art, for example as described in the \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, second edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, 1994\n (incorporated herein by reference). The composition can be administered in the form of tablets, capsules, powders for reconstitution, syrups, food (such as food bars, biscuits, snack foods and other standard food forms well known in the art), or in drink formulations. Drinks can contain flavoring, buffers and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition can comprise a non-racemic mixture of S-equol and R-equol, having an enantiomeric excess (EE) for S-equol of more than 0% and less than 90%. A composition that has an EE of 0% is a 50:50 racemic mixture of the two enantiomers. The composition can be made directly from a racemic mixture, by an incomplete separation and removal of either the R-equol or S-equol enantiomer from the racemic mixture. The composition can also be made by combining a first equol component comprising a mixture (either a non-racemic or racemic mixture) of equol, with a second component comprising a composition consisting essentially of S-equol or R-equol. This produces a non-racemic composition that has an excess of S-equol or R-equol. Depending upon the specific benefit or indication for the R-equol component and the S-equol component in a composition, a composition can be prepared comprising S-equol and R-equol at a ratio of S-equol to R-equol from greater than about 50:50 to about 99.5:1, more typically about 51:49 to about 99:1,and from less than about 50:50 to about 1:99.5, more typically about 49:51 to about 1:99. The composition typically does not comprise a significant amount of any other androgen-receptor binding compound. Selected ratios of S-equol to R-equol includes from about 3:1 to about 19:1\n,\n about 3:1 to about 9:1, about 4:1 to about 19:1, and about 4:1 to about 9:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions suitable for oral administration can be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the extract; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fuller understanding of the invention and its uses can be derived from the following experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperiment\n 1. Determination of receptor binding capacity of equol S- and R-enantiomers. \nIn vitro\n binding studies were performed to examine the relative affinities of S- and R-enantiomeric equol with the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. Full length rat ERα expression vector (pcDNA-ERα; RH Price UCSF) and ERβ expression vector (pcDNA-ERβ; TA Brown, Pfizer, Groton, CT) were used to synthesize hormone receptors in vitro using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) with T7-RNA polymerase, during a 90 min reaction at 30° C. Translation reaction mixtures were stored at -80° C until further use. In_order to calculate and establish the binding affinity of the S-equol and R-equol enantiomers for ERα and ERβ, 100µL aliquots of reticulocyte lysate supernatant were incubated at optimal time and temperature; 90 min at room temperature (ERβ) or 18 hrs at 4°C (ERα), with increasing (0.01-100 nm) concentrations of [\n3\nH] 17β-estradiol (E2). These times were determined empirically and represent optimal binding of receptor with estrogen. Nonspecific binding was assessed using a 300-fold excess of the ER agonist, diethylstilbestrol, in parallel tubes. Following incubation, bound and unbound [\n3\nH]E2 were separated by passing the incubation reaction through a 1mL lipophilic Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, MO) column. Columns were constructed by packing a disposable pipette tip (1mL; Labcraft, Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc, Houston, TX) with TEGMD (10mm Tris-Cl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 25mm molybdate, and 1mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4)-saturated Sephadex according to previously published protocols (Handa et al., 1986; O'Keefe and Handa, 1990). For chromatography, the columns were re-equilibrated with TEGMD (100µL), and the incubation reactions were added individually to each column and allowed to incubate on the column for an additional 30 min. Following this incubation, 600µL of TEGMD were added to each column, flow-through was collected, 4 mL scintillation fluid was added, and samples were counted (5 min each) in an 2900 TR Packard scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetition binding studies were used to assess the estrogenic properties of equol's S-equol and R-equol enantiomers. Based on the ability of S and R to compete with [\n3\nH]E2 for ER binding, the affinities for in vitro translated ER were shown to be very different for the two enantiomers. The S-equol enantiomer showed greatest affinity for ERβ [Kd (nM) = 0.73 ± 0.2], while its affinity for ERα was relatively low by comparison [Kd(nM) = 6.41 ± 1.0]. The R-equol enantiomer possessed a much lower affinity for both ERβ [Kd (nM) = 15.4 ± 1.3] and ERα [Kd (nM) = 27.38 ± 3.8]. For reference 17β-estradiol binds ERα with a Kd (nM) = 0.13 and ERβ with a Kd (nM) = 0.15 in this system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe study showed that only the S-equol enantiomer binds ER with sufficient affinity to have potential relevance to circulating equol levels reported in humans. Compared with 17β-estradiol the relative binding affinities of the S-equol and R-equol enantiomers for ERα were 1/49 and 1/211that of 17β-estradiol, respectively. However, the S-equol enantiomer seems to be largely ERβ-selective with a relatively high affinity for ERβ, while the R-equol enantiomer binds with approximately 1/100 the affinity of S-equol. The separate and associated determination that exclusively S-equol is found in human plasma and urine is significant in view of the specificity in binding of the two enantiomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperiment\n 2. Bioavailability of R-equol: 20 mg of pure R-equol was administered orally to a healthy adult after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected at timed intervals over the next 24 hours and the plasma concentration of equol was determined by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring. Rapid appearance of equol is observed in the plasma with peak concentrations observed after 8 hours. The terminal elimination half-life of R-equol was approximately 8 hours. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed that the equol present in plasma was the R-equol enantiomer (PCT Patent Publication \n \nW004-009035\n \n), thereby establishing that it is stable and does not undergo any racemization or further biotransformation in the intestine. \nFIGURE 2\n shows a plasma appearance/disappearance plot of R-equol. These results establish that R-equol, if administered as a pharmacologic or nutraceutical preparation, is bioavailable. Similar results have been obtained where S-equol was administered orally to a healthy adult.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples demonstrate the use of the invention, and the benefits that are derived from it. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the invention, the following protocols are used, and will be referred to in the examples that follow:\n\n\n \n\n\nProtocols Used in Examples of the \nInvention\n \n\n\n\n\n1. Preparation of Test Material Stock Solutions\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately 20 to 40 mg of the test material was weighed into pre-tared sterile glass vials and the precise weight was recorded. Vehicle volume is then calculated to give a 50% w/v solution, and the vehicle is added. Two different vehicles were used, as indicated in Examples. DMSO vehicle is prepared from 100% DMSO (EMD Biosciences Cat. #MX1458-6, Lot #42364321). Transcutol vehicle, prepared from 100% transcutol (Gattefosse a.s.a., Cedex, France). Samples are then vortexed vigorously until the dry powder is visually brought into solution. In some cases, samples need to be briefly warmed to 37° C. Stock solution aliquots can be frozen in small aliquots and maintained at approximately -20° C, or used immediately after preparation. Racemic mixtures of equol are prepared for testing at concentrations of 0 (control), 0.3, 1.0, and 5.0%. A positive control is prepared using ascorbic acid at a concentration of 50 µg/ml in DMEM/F-12. After stock solutions are diluted for use they are then discarded.\n\n\n \n2. MTT Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nMTT Assay is performed to determine toxicity of equol in tissue culture. Measurement of cell viability and proliferation forms the basis for numerous in vitro assays of a cell population's response to external factors. The reduction of tetrazolium salts is now widely accepted as a reliable way to examine cell proliferation. The MTT assay is a colorimetric analysis of the metabolic activity of the cell (ATCC; Gaithersberg MD; Catalogue #30-1010K). The yellow tetrazolium MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) is reduced by metabolically active cells to generate reducing equivalents such as NADH and NADPH. The resulting intracellular purple formazan can be solubilized and quantified by spectrophotometric means. The MTT Cell Proliferation Assay measures the cell proliferation rate and conversely, when metabolic events lead to apoptosis or necrosis, the reduction in cell viability. A linear relationship between cell number and signal produced is established, thus allowing an accurate quantification of changes in the rate of cell proliferation. In some cases or experiments, the results of the MTT Assay will be used to normalize the results of the Procollagen Type I C Peptide Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compatibility test is carried out with the test material(s) used in the test system. An aliquot of each test material is mixed with an equal volume of 2 mg/ml MTT solution, in a glass test tube. Tubes are capped and incubated in the dark at room temperature for approximately 2 hours unless conversion occurs sooner. Evidence of a color change to purple indicates that the test material may spontaneously reduce MTT, resulting in a false reaction. If a color change is noticed, \"blank tissue meshes\" are run. These blanks are dosed with the same amount of test material as in the assay and run for the longest time point only. Background readings are subtracted from the respective test materials if any are observed.\n\n\n \n3. Use of TestSkin in Tissue Culture\n\n\n \n \n \nTestSkin II tissue is used to assess the ability of the test materials to either promote or inhibit collagen synthesis. This test is also used to assess the viability of the tissues after exposure to the test materials. TestSkin II consists of a mechanically stable and physiologically functional skin construct that closely simulates the actual structure and biological response mechanism of living human skin. The tissue has both an epidermis and a dermis. The upper epidermal layer consists of living human keratinocytes and has a well differentiated stratum corneum. The epidermis grows on a supporting dermal layer that consists of a bovine collagen lattice interspersed with living human dermal fibroblasts that align the collagen into a dense matrix. TestSkin is used according to the following Tissue Culture Protocol\n\n\n \nTestSkin Tissue Culture Protocol, Day One:\n\n\n \n \n \nEnough six-well plates are taken to complete the assay and placed under the hood. The package containing each plate is opened, the plate cover removed and turned upside down on the working surface. One Millicell per well is placed into each well of a six-well plate, along with 1 ml of DMEM/F-12. The plate cover is replaced and the six-well plate set aside until the TestSkin II unit is sectioned and ready for storage. To section the TestSkin II unit, the outer surface of the sealed pouch is wiped with 70% ethanol. The pouch is opened using sterile scissors and the tray containing the TestSkin II unit removed. The cover from the TestSkin II tray is removed and placed upside down on the working surface, so that the inside of the cover remains sterile. The TestSkin II transwell is removed by using sterile forceps and placed on the inside of the cover. To section the TestSkin II unit, a sterile biopsy punch (8mm) is used. The punch is placed on the surface of the TcstSkin II unit and slowly pressed down and twisted simultaneously. The punch is rotated back and forth approximately ¼ turn while sufficient pressure is applied to cut through both the skin and the polycarbonate membrane. The punch is not twisted completely around, as this tends to rip the skin. When the individual section is separated from the rest of the skin, it is removed with sterile needle nose forceps; only the edge of the section is grasped, and care is taken not to pinch or fold the section. The section is carefully placed dermis side down onto the Millicell, ensuring that it lies flat with no air bubbles between the bottom of the Millicell and the skin. It is helpful for one edge to be placed down first and the remaining portion slowly lowered so that no air bubbles form. The epidermal surface remains facing up and the polycarbonate membrane with the dermal surface lies against the Millicell. This procedure is repeated until the correct number of sections have been separated and placed within the Millicells of the six-well plate. Once the sectioning is complete, the cover is placed back onto the plate and the plate is placed into an incubator at approximately 37±2°C and 5±1% CO\n2\n for overnight (16-24 hours). TestSkin Tissue Culture Protocol, Day Two:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe media in each well is aspirated and replaced with 1 ml fresh DMEM/F-12 media. For each treatment group (negative control, positive control, and test materials), 10 µl of material is placed onto tissues and covered with a dosing pad. The tissues are placed back into the incubator at approximately 37±2°C and 5±1% CO\n2\n for approximately 48 hours.\n\n\n \nTestSkin Tissue Culture Protocol, Day Three:\n\n\n \n \n \nAll test samples are dosed topically again with 10 µl of each treatment per tissue. The tissues are placed back into the incubator at approximately 37 ± 2°C and 5 ± 1% CO\n2\n for approximately 24 hours.\n\n\n \nTestSkin Tissue Culture Protocol, Day Four:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe media from each well is removed and frozen for subsequent procollagen assays. The MTT assay is performed immediately on three of the four tissue samples in each treatment set. The fourth tissue from each treatment group is fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and subjected to histological staining. The histology slides are examined by microscope for elastin and collagen analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 2 mg/ml MTT solution (enough for 2 mg/tissue) is made with DMEM/F-12 (pre-warmed to 37 ± 2°C). The MTT solution is mixed for 10-15 minutes at room temperature on a stir plate. The solution is then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4000 rpm. The pellet is discarded and only the supernatant used. The MTT solution is added to the wells of a six-well plate (2 ml/well). The tissues are removed from the Millicell inserts and rinsed with at least 5 ml of PBS from a wash bottle over a beaker. The tissues are rinsed until all test material is removed. The tissues are then placed into the corresponding well of the six-well plate. The plates are incubated for approximately 2 hours at approximately 37±2°C and 5±1% CO\n2\n on a shaker plate at 125 rpm. At the end of the 2 hr incubation, the MTT solution is removed and discarded. One ml of PBS is added to each well for 2 minutes twice. Each PBS wash is removed by aspiration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the MTT exposure, the tissues are incubated in a 600 µg/m1 Thermolysin solution (DMEM/F-12 for a 2 ml total volume) for 30 minutes at 37±2°C. This incubation time should be sufficient to allow for the separation of the dermal and epidermal layers of the tissue. The epidermis should be floating on top of the dermis. The dermal portions of the tissue are placed into a separate set of 6-well plates. The MTT is extracted from both sets of plates with 1 ml per well of isopropyl alcohol. The plates are placed on a shaker plate for 1 hour. After isopropanol extraction, 200 µl of extract is transferred to the corresponding wells of a 96-well plate. The plate is read at 540 nm.\n\n\n \n4. Human Dermal Fibroblast Tissue Culture Protocol\n\n\n \n \n \nPrimary human dermal fibroblasts from neonatal foreskin at passage 10-11 were seeded into 48 well plates at 2.5e4 cells/well/0.5 mls medium which consisted of DMEM (MediaTech, Cat. #10-017-CV, Lot #10017103) with 1x non-essential amino acids (HyClone Cat. #SH30238.01, Lot #AMC15759), 1x antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma Cat. # A5955, Lot#13K2363) and 2% bovine calf serum (HyClone Cat. #SH30072.03, Lot #ANF-18955). Samples from a previous lot of calf serum (Lot # AMM17780), were also used. Cells were cultured for approximately 16-24 hours in a 37° C, humidified incubator with 5% CO\n2\n, then the medium was changed and equol, ascorbic acid (Sigma, Cat. #A4544, Lot#073K0139) or vehicle was added to media in the wells. Cells were cultured for approximately 48 hours in the presence of test or control materials.\n\n\n \n5. Organotypic, Three-dimensional Dermal Cultures\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the production of organotypic, three-dimensional (3D) cultures, dermal fibroblasts were seeded to nylon mesh and allowed to grow for approximately 8 weeks essentially as described (see \nFleishmajer, J Invest Dermatol, 97:638-643, 1991\n; \nContard, Cell Tissue Res, 273: 571-575, 1993\n and \nPinney, Liu, Sheeman and Mansbridge, J Cell Physiology, 183: 74-82, 2000\n). This \nin vitro\n model closely mimics the development of the dermis, offering a system for study with organotypic properties, such as the ability to support epidermal differentiation (see \nSlivka, J Invest Dermatol, 100: 40-46, 1993\n) and collagen fibrillogenesis (\nContard, Cell Tissue Res, 273: 571-575, 1993\n). After 2 weeks all 3D cultures were supplemented with 20 ug/ml ascorbate while monolayer cultures did not. Otherwise, all materials and procedures were essentially equivalent between monolayer and 3D experiments. To examine the effects of estrogenic test materials in an environment with undetectable levels of estrogenic activity, the 3D experiments were grown in phenol red-free medium for 3 weeks prior to addition of test materials, and were therefore never exposed to the phenol red dye.\n\n\n \n6. Human Prostate Cancer Cell Cultures\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman prostate cancer cell line was obtained from ATCC (ATCC # CRL-1740, LNCAP-FGC) and was cultured in a 37° C, humidified incubator with 5% CO\n2\n, in RPMI Medium (Sigma Cat. # R-8758) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Cat. # SH30088.03, Lot number APC20780) and 5mM Hepes (Sigma Cat. H-0887), 1x antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma Cat. # A5955). Cells were expanded in T-150 flasks for three passages until cryopreservation and storage in liquid nitrogen in RPMI medium with 10% FBS and 10% DMSO as cryopreservative. A cryovial was then thawed in a 37° C water bath, expanded again one or two passages, and then plated at 10,000 cells per 96 well in 0.2 mls medium in 96 well plates in \nRPMI\n 5% FBS medium. After approximately 48 hours, the medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM/F12 (Gibco Cat. #21041-025) with 2% FBS and 1x antibiotic/antimycotic. and test materials and DMSO/vehicle controls were added to the appropriate concentration from 10x stocks. Cells were cultured for approximately 48 hours in the presence of test materials and controls prior to removal of medium supernatants for prostate specific antigen (PSA) ELISA.\n\n\n \n7. Collagen Type I C-Propeptide ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nCollagens (types I, II, III, IV, and V) are synthesized as precursor molecules called procollagens. These contain additional peptide sequences called propeptides that facilitate the winding of procollagen molecules into a triple-helical conformation within the endoplasmic reticulum. The propeptides are cleaved off from the collagen triple helix molecule during its secretion, after which, the triple helix collagens polymerize into extracellular collagen fibrils. Thus, the amount of the free propeptides reflects stoichiometrically the amount of collagen molecules synthesized (Takara Biomedicals, Collagen Type I C-Propeptide Kit).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDermal fibroblasts synthesize primarily type I collagen, and the cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide is required for deposition into fibrils within the extracellular matrix. This propeptide can be measured using antisera which do not recognize the unprocessed form in cell culture supernatants, and is also used clinically as a measure of fibrosis in patient sera. The amount of cleaved propeptide is directly proportional to the amount of type I collagen, deposited, and can be precisely quantified using purified standards and a commercial ELISA kit (Takara Mirus, Inc., Cat. #TAK-MK-101). After 48 hours in the presence of test materials or controls, culture medium supernatants were removed and immediately analyzed using the ELISA kit according to manufacturer's instructions using a Molecular Devices Vmax plate 96 well plate reader and SoftMax software. Since ascorbic acid (ascorbate, Sigma Cat. #A4544, Lot #073K0139) is known to stimulate collagen deposition, it was used as a positive control, and added to media in a final concentration of 20 ug,/ml. Vehicle-treated media or media alone was used as a negative or blank control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSupernatants or media from tissue culture is collected from culture plates or wells. Sample supernatants are spun in a centrifuge at 2000-3000 rpm for 5-10 minutes and collagen Type I C-propeptide is quantitated. The pellet is not used in the study. The preparation of the assay solutions is as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\nStandard Solution (640 no PIP/mi):\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe standard is rehydrated with 1 ml of distilled water and mixed slowly by rolling on the countertop intermittently for approximately 10 minutes. The standards are made as shown in TABLE 1. The standard solution is stable for 1 week at 4°C. The standards are tested in duplicate.\n\n \nTABLE 1.

Distilled water is added to give a final volume of 200 ml. The solution is mixed well. This solution can be stored at 2-26°C for up to 6 months.\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody-POD Conjugate Solution:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe contents of \nVial\n 1 are dissolved in 11 ml of distilled water and mixed gently by rolling on the countertop. The vial must be wrapped in foil as it is light sensitive. The solution is mixed slowly for approximately 10 minutes and foam formation is avoided. This solution is prepared directly before use and transferred immediately to the microtiter plate. Aliquots of 100 µl of antibody-POD Conjugate Solution are pipetted into the standard wells and the sample wells. The standard and the samples (20 µl of each) are pipetted into their corresponding wells. The microtiter plate is mixed by gently tapping the side for 15 seconds, then is sealed with foil and incubated at 37°C for approximately 3 hours. At the end of the incubation, the solutions are removed from each well by inverting the plate, and washing each well 4 times with approximately 400 µl of PBS. Between each wash, the microtiter plate is emptied by inverting it and tapping upside down on a paper towel to remove as much of the PBS as possible. Substrate solution (100 µl) is pipetted into each well. The plate is tapped gently for 15 seconds to mix, and incubated at room temperature (20-30°C) for 15 minutes. Stop solution (100 µl) is pipetted into each well and the plate tapped gently to mix for 15 seconds. The absorbance of the samples is measured at 450 nm on the ELISA microplate reader.\n\n\n \n\n\nCalculations and Data Analysis:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the Collagen Type I C-Propeptide assay, if more than one reading per sample is taken, the readings for each sample are averaged. To derive the standard curve, plot the absorbance versus the PIP concentration in ng/ml for the standards using log-log scale. For the samples, locate the average absorbance value on the vertical axis and follow a horizontal line intersecting the standard curve. At the point of intersection, read the PIP concentration (ng/ml) from the horizontal axis. The procollagen values (ng) are normalized for variations in tissue size or makeup by dividing by the dermis MTT value, since the dermal layer of the tissue is responsible for collagen synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mean OD value and standard deviation for all MTT (dermis + epidermis) replicate samples is calculated. The percent of viability is calculated by using the following equation:\n \n \nViability\n \n \n \n \n%\n \n \n=\n \n \nMean OD of Test Material\n \n/\n \nMean OD of Negative Control\n \n \n×\n \n100.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n8. PSA ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nTissue culture supernatants were diluted 10-fold in PBS and stored at -20°C, then thawed at room temperature prior to assaying. A commercial ELISA kit for free PSA (Bio-Quant, Cat. # BQ 067T) was utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions, and data was determined using a Molecular Devices Vmax 96 well plate reader and SoftMax software.\n\n\n \n9. Intracellular FACS Analysis and Cell Cycle Determinations\n\n\n \n \n \nSingle-cell suspensions were produced by gently trypsinization of monolayers, or extensive digestion in 1 mg/ml collagenase from 3D cultures. A commercial kit was utilized for the preparation of cells for intracellular detection by flow cytometry (IntraCyte, Orion BioSolutions, Inc., Cat. # 01017) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with non-ionic detergents, and non-specific protein binding was blocked. The following primary antibodies were used at 1-2 ug/ml: affinity-purified, anti-hunan collagen type I (Chemicon Inc., Cat. #AB758), affinity-purified anti-human type III collagen (Sothern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Cat. # 1330-01), monoclonal anti-human elastin (Sigma, Inc., Cat. # E4013), polyclonal anti-human elastase (The Binding Site Inc., Cat. #PC052), and monoclonal anti-human MMP-3/stromelysin-l (Calbiochem Inc., Cat. #IM362). Negative controls included irrelevant immunoglobulins from the same species as each primary antibody and at the same concentration, as well as unstained cell, and cells without primary antibody. Primary antibody binding was detected using affinity-purified, species-specific, fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. For FACS analysis, a Coulter EPICS Elite cytometer equipped with 488 nm argon laser was used and approximately 20,000 cells per file were analyzed using Coulter ELITE software.\n\n\n \n10. Ocular and Dermal Irritection Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Ocular and Dermal Irritection assays are quantitative \nin vitro\n test methods that mimic acute ocular and dermal irritation tests. To perform the Ocular Irritection standardized assay, the test sample is applied to a synthetic biobarrier composed of a semi-permeable membrane. To perform the Dermal Irritection standardized assay, the test sample is applied to a similar synthetic biobarrier that is coated with a dye-containing keratin-collagen matrix. Following application, the sample is absorbed by and permeates through this synthetic biobarrier to gradually come into contact with a proprietary solution containing highly ordered globulins and glycoproteins. Reaction of the test sample with these proteins and macromolecular complexes promotes conformational changes that may be readily detected as an increase in the turbidity of the protein solution. With the Ocular Irritection test, turbidity may be detected spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 mn. With the Dermal Irritection test, dye that has been dissociated from the biobarrier during transit of the applied sample may be detected spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 450 mn.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ocular irritancy potential of a test sample is expressed as an Irritection Draize Equivalent (IDE), whereas the dermal irritancy potential of a test sample is expressed as a Human Irritancy Equivalent (HIE) score. These scores are defined by comparing the increase in optical density (OD\n405/450\n) produced by the test material to a standard curve that is constructed by measuring the increase in OD produced by a set of Calibration substances. These Calibrators have been selected for use in these tests because their irritancy potential has been previously documented in a series of \nin vivo\n investigations. The predicted \nin vivo\n classification, based on these scoring systems, is shown in TABLES 2 and 3. In general, the program has been designed to accept sample data as qualified if the following criteria are met: the OD values of Calibrators and internal Quality Control samples fall within previously specified ranges; sample blanks are less than 500 OD units; the net sample OD is greater than -15; and an Inhibition Check is negative.\n\n \nTABLE 2.

Statistical Analyses\n\n\n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, data were analyzed by analysis of variance statistics (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Significance was p < 0.05. Curve fitting, scientific graphing, and analysis were completed using GraphPad Software(GraphPad Prism 3.0, San Diego, CA).\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates equol selectively binding \nin vitro\n to 5α-DHT. In initial binding competition studies conducted to determine and establish equol's binding affinity for AR, binding of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT was greater in the presence of equol than in its absence. Slight modifications in the protocol where AR was removed from the incubation tube (leaving only [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT and equol) resulted in the elution of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT into the eluate containing [\n3\nH) 5α-DHT reaction complex. Sephadex LH-20 columns of 30 cm are used in order to identify elution peaks establishing the binding of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT to equol. As shown in \nFIGURE 3\n, a peak of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT is apparent in the elution fractions between 5 and 9mL when the [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT+equol column incubate is applied. This peak is not present when [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT alone is applied to the column. Furthermore, when 5α-DHT or 5α-DHT+equol are incubated with prostate supernatant and then passed through the 30cm column (\nFIGURE 4A\n) two distinct binding peaks are identifiable. The first peak of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT represents that bound to the AR in prostate. This is found in the elution fractions between 4 and 5 ml. In addition there is a later peak (between 5 and 9 ml), consistent with the binding of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT to equol. However, when [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT is allowed to incubate with the prostate supernatant for 36 hours (until equilibrium) prior to the introduction of equol there is no apparent binding of [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT (\nFIGURE 4B\n). Both [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT and [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT + equol (equol added 36 hours later) show a single peak in the elution between 4 and 5ml, suggesting that equol does not compete with 5α-DHT for the AR nor does it bind [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT that is already bound to the receptor. Furthermore, it should be noted that the binding of equol to 5α-DHT appears to be specific, since similar competition and binding studies have been conducted using other steroids such as [\n3\nH]E2, [\n3\nH)T, [\n3\nH]DHEA, [\n3\nH]CORT and [\n3\nH]progesterone without any occurrences of significant binding to equol (data not shown). Saturation analysis of equol binding to [\n3\nH] 5α-DHT shows an apparent Kd calculated at 1.32 ± 0.4 nM (\nFIGURE 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTABLE 4 shows 33 different steroid compounds that have been tested in binding assays to determine equol's affinity for binding to each. While equol has modest affinity for 5α-reduced steroids, equol displayed the highest affinity for 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) and had no affinity for 5β-dihydrotestosterone (5β-DHT) or some of the most common natural sex steroids, such as: estradiol, estrone, estriol, progesterone or testosterone.\n\n \nTABLE 4 Steroid Compounds used in Equol Binding Assays\n \n \n \nChemical Name\n \nTrivial Name\n \n \n \n \n4-ANDROSTEN-17β-OL-3-ONE\n \nTESTOSTERONE\n \n \n \n5-ANDROSTEN-3β-OL-17-ONE\n \nDHEA\n \n \n \n5α-ANDROSTAN-3α,17β-DIOL\n \n17β-DIHYDROANDROSTERONE\n \n \n \n5α-ANDROSTAN-3β-17α-DIOL\n \nNA\n \n \n \n5α-ANDROSTAN-3β,17β-DIOL\n \nNA\n \n \n \n5α-ANDROSTAN-3,17-DIONE\n \nANDROSTANEDIONE\n \n \n \n5α-ANDROSTAN-17β-OL-3-ONE\n \n5α-DHT\n \n \n \n5β-ANDROSTAN-17β-OL\n \nNA\n \n \n \n5β-ANDROSTAN-17β-OL-3-ONE\n \n5β-DHT\n \n \n \n4-ANDROSTEN-3,7-DIONE\n \nANDROSTENEDIONE\n \n \n \n1,3,5(10)-ESTRATRIEN-3,17α∀-DIOL\n \nEPIESTRADIOL\n \n \n \n1,3,5(10)-ESTRATRIEN-3,17β-DIOL\n \nESTRADIOL (E2)\n \n \n \n1,3,5(10)-ESTRATRIEN-3,16α,17β-TRIOL\n \nESTRIOL (E3)\n \n \n \n1,3,5(10)-ESTRATRIEN-3-OL-17-ONE\n \nESTRONE (E1)\n \n \n \n5α-ESTRAN-3,17-DIONE\n \n5α-DIHYDROANDROSTENDIONE\n \n \n \n5-PREGNEN-3β-OL-20-ONE\n \nPREGNENOLONE\n \n \n \n4-PREGENEN-3,20-DIONE\n \nPROGESTERONE (P4)\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-3α-OL-20-ONE\n \nALLOPREGNANOLONE\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-11β,21-DIOL-3,20-DIONE\n \nALLODIHYDROCOSTERONE\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-3α,11β,21-TRIOL-20-ONE\n \nALLOTETRAHYDROCORTICOSTEROME\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-3β, 21β, 21-TRIOL-20-ONE\n \nEPIALLOTETRAHYDROCORTICOSTERONE\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-3β,11β,17,21-TETROL-20-ONE\n \n3β,5α-TETRAHYDROCORTISOL\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-11β,17,21-TRIOL-3,20-DIONE\n \nALLODIHYDROCORTISOL\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-17,21-DIOL-3,11,20-TRIONE\n \nALLODIHYDROCORTISONE,\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-3β-OL-20-ONE\n \n5α-DIHYDROPREGNANOLONE\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-3,20-DIONE\n \n5α-DIHYDROPROGESTERONE (5α-DHP)\n \n \n \n5β-PREGNAN-3α-OL-20-ONE\n \n3α-HYDROXY-5βTETRAHYDROPROGESTONE\n \n \n \n5β-PREGNAN-11β,21-DIOL-3,20-DIONE\n \n5β -DIHYDROCORTICOSTERONE\n \n \n \n5β-PREGNAN-3α,11β,21-TRIOL-20-ONE\n \nTETRAHYDROCORTICOSTERONE\n \n \n \n5β-PREGNAN-3α,11β,17,21-TETROL-20-ONE\n \nTETRAHYDROHYDROCORTISOL\n \n \n \n5β-PREGNAN-11β,17,21-TRIOL-3,20-DIONE\n \n5β-DIHYDROCORTISOL\n \n \n \n5α-PREGNAN-17,21-DIOL-3,11,20-TRIONE\n \n5β -DIHYDROCORTISONE\n \n \n \n5β-PREGNAN-3,20-DIONE\n \n5β-DIHYDROPROGESTERONE (5β-DHP)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nExample 2:\n\n\n \n \n \nLong-Evans male rats are raised on either a phytoestrogen-rich diet containing 600 micrograms of isoflavones per gram of diet or 600 ppm of isoflavones (referred to hereafter as the \"Phyto-600\" diet) or a diet containing very low levels of isoflavones (referred to hereafter as the 'Phyto-Free' diet; containing approximately 10 ppm of isoflavones). To demonstrate that circulating isoflavone levels are different in Phyto-600- vs. Phyto-Free-fed male and female (75 day-old) rats, serum isoflavone levels were determined by GC/MS as previously performed by our laboratories (see methods in \nK.D.R. Setchell, Am J Clin Nutr 129:1333S-1346S, 1998\n; and \nK.D.R. Setchell et al, J Nutr 132:3577-3584, 2002\n.). In each case for the different classifications of isoflavones Phyto-600-fed males display significantly higher isoflavones levels compared to Phyto-Free-fed values, shown in TABLE 5 as isoflavone concentrations in adult male and female rats. More importantly, equol levels in the Phyto-600-fed rats account for approximately 78% of the total phytoestrogen levels.\n\n \nTABLE 5. Isoflavone levels in male rats (ng/ml serum)\n \n \n \n \n \nGenistein\n \nDaidzein\n \nEquol\n \nTotal\n \n \n \n \n- Phyto-Free Diet\n \n9.6 ±0.3\n \n10.8 ±0.6\n \n23.2±0.4.\n \n43.5±1.0\n \n \n \n- Phyto-600 Diet\n \n413 ±67\n \n394 ±58\n \n1,161 ± 325\n \n1,967 ±45\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine if other metabolic hormones were altered by the diet treatments or by age, serum glucose and thyroid (T3) levels are assayed. Glucose levels are slightly but not significantly higher in the Phyto-600-fed males compared to Phyto-Free-fed values, independent of age or source of the blood samples [either arterial (ART) or venous (TRUNK)], shown in \nFIGURE 6\n. However, when T3 levels are quantified, there is a significant increase in T3 serum levels in 80 or 110 day-old male Long-Evans rats fed the Phyto-600 diet compared to Phyto-Free-fed animals, shown in \nFIGURE 7\n. This demonstrates that thyroid levels are enhanced with soy consumption, consistent with anecdotal evidence of individuals that decreased their thyroid medication or went off of thyroid treatment completely with the consumption of soy based foods in their diets. This is also consistent with reports of a similar increase in T3 levels in humans following consumption of soy foods (\nWatanabe, S. et al, Biofactors 2000: 12:233-41\n and \nLephart, E.D. et al, Nutrition Metab (London) 2004:1:16\n).\n\n\n \nExample 3:\n\n\n \n \n \nPrior to initiation of a Phyto-Free diet period, Male Long-Evans rats are fed a Phyto-200 diet, as described in previous examples. The rats are placed on a diet containing the Phyto-Free diet at approximately 52 days of age and randomly assigned to three groups. Beginning at 73 days of age, rats receive daily subcutaneous 0.1cc injections of vehicle (peanut oil), 1 milligram of a racemic mixture of equol in vehicle (0.83 mg/kg body weight/day), or 5 milligrams of a racemic mixture of equol in vehicle (4.2 mg/kg body weight/day) once every three days. To determine whether equol injections have an adverse effect on male reproductive organs, testis weights are quantified in these animals. There are no significant alterations in testes weight with the equol injections, with testicular weight essentially the same among the injection treatment groups, shown in \nFIGURE 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 9\n shows the distribution in human skin of estrogen receptor beta (ER-β), the 5α-reductase enzyme (5α,R) and androgen receptors (AR) in balding skin (\nFIGURE 9A\n), hair follicle bulb (\nFIGURE 9B\n) and sebaceious gland (\nFIGURE 9C\n). Familiarity with the locations of these enzymes and receptors is important for discussion of the following examples.\n\n\n \nExample 4:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of equol on collagen synthesis in the TestSkin model was assessed. In examining the epidermal region only, vehicle, ascorbic acid, or 0.3% racemic equol have similar amounts of procollagen as measured by the Procollagen Type I C-PeptideAssay, above, shown in \nFIGURE 10\n. The negative control substance synthesized less procollagen compared to the control vehicle. However, a 1.0% concentration of racemic equol induced approximately 4 times as much procollagen synthesis, and 5.0% racemic equol induced an 18-fold increase versus vehicle control levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe normalized average of epidermal and dermal regions treated with vehicle, ascorbic acid, or 0.3% racemic equol also demonstrates similar amounts of procollagen, shown in \nFIGURE 11\n, and samples incubated with the negative control substance synthesized less procollagen. Racemic equol at 1% concentration induced approximately 4 times as much procollagen synthesis, and a 5% concentration resulted in an approximate 6-fold increase. In examining the dermal region only vehicle, ascorbic acid, or 0.3% racemic equol have similar amounts of procollagen, shown in \nFIGURE 12\n, and the negative control substance synthesized slightly less procollagen. Racemic equol at 1% and 5% concentrations induced approximately 4 times as much procollagen synthesized compared to vehicle control levels. Thus, using this artificial \n(in vitro)\n skin model, a threshold of 1 % equol appears to be sufficient to provide maximal stimulation of procollagen in the dermal region.\n\n\n \nExample 5:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis study evaluated the effects of racemic equol and 17β-Estradiol at 3 different concentrations (0.01 %, 0.001 % and 0.0001 %) on primary human dermal fibroblast viability by MTT Assay, and collagen deposition by Collagen Type I C-propeptide ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquol was tested against the natural steroid hormone, 17-β estradiol to determine cytotoxicity to human dermal monolayer fibroblasts by quantifying reduced MTT as described in the MTT Assay Protocol above (\nFIGURE 13\n). The test materials, equol and 17-β estradiol were dissolved in dimethysulfoxide (DMSO), a common cell culture vehicle. The test materials were assayed at 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001% equol in 0.2, 0.02 and 0.002% of DMSO as the vehicle. The range for untreated controls varied from 0.77 to 0.93 OD units. Over the range of concentrations tested equol was no more toxic to human dermal monolayer fibroblasts than 17-β estradiol. Additionally, at concentrations of 0.001% and 0.0001% of the test materials the reduced MTT values were within the range of the untreated controls, indicating that the cytotoxicity levels were equivalent to untreated control values. At the highest concentration of 0.01%, the cytotoxicity levels of the test materials were approximately 0.52 and 0.48 for equol and 17-β estradiol, respectively, which are acceptable results for \nin vitro\n assay conditions. Thus, at the concentrations tested, equol is not more toxic to human dermal monolayer fibroblasts compared to the natural steroid hormone, 17-β estradiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCollagen deposition was quantified in human dermal monolayer fibroblast by ELISA (\nFIGURE 14\n). The vehicle DMSO served as the negative control, while ascorbate without DMSO served as the positive control. When groups treated with 100 and 10 µg/ml equol were compared to the same concentrations of 17-β estradiol, significant 2.1-fold and 1.55-fold increases, respectively, in collagen deposition were observed. This example demonstrates that equol has significantly greater collagen stimulating properties compared to the natural steroid hormone, 17-β estradiol. The significant increase in collagen production in this human dermal monolayer fibroblast assay demonstrates that the stimulatory effect of equol on collagen provides an effective way to treat skin parameters such as mechanical, physical and photo-aging damage and the influence of biological aging on wrinkle formation in skin.\n\n\n \nExample 6:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effects of equol on skin, as assessed by collagen deposition are assessed by Procollagen Type I C-Peptide ELISA using human dermal monolayer fibroblasts in \nvitro.\n This study evaluated the effects of a commercially used skin penetrating agent, transcutol in delivering the test material equol in determining human dermal fibroblast viability by MTT Assay, and collagen deposition by Collagen Type I C-temninal Propeptide ELISA. Transcutol, or dipropylene glycol, has been proven safe and effective in the delivery of active ingredients of cosmetic applications for human skin health (\nFinal report on the safety, assessment of butylenes glycol, hexylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, and dipropylene glycol, Journal of the American College of Toxicology, \n). When human dermal monolayer fibrobast cytotoxicity was examined, the equol treatment at 0.0001 % (w/v of transcutol) was not significantly different compared to the 0.0002% transcutol vehicle or untreated controls (\nFIGURE 15\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, equol was tested in the human dermal monolayer fibroblast assay to determine whether it could stimulate collagen deposition. As shown in \nFIGURE 16\n, untreated control values were at 330 ± 30 ng/ml (horizontal line) and this level was similar to that of 0.002% transcutol vehicle. However, 0.0001% equol significantly stimulated collagen deposition 1.8-fold above untreated control levels and 1.6-fold above the transcutol vehicle levels, demonstrating that transcutol is an effective method for the delivery of equol to human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, treatment with equol did not differ from the positive control treatment with ascorbate, suggesting that 0.000 1% equol maximally stimulated collagen deposition in this \nin vitro\n human dermal monolayer fibroblast assay system. The significant stimulatory influence of equol on human dermal fibroblasts to significantly increase the deposition of collagen can address several important issues of human skin health such as applications of mechanical, physical and photo-aging damage, and the natural biological and chronological process of skin aging.\n\n\n \nExample 7:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis is an example of the ability of equol to bind and block 5α-DHT \nin vitro.\n Cytotoxicity of equol on human dermal fibroblasts cells was determined by MTT Assay (\nFIGURE 17\n). The negative control consisted of tissue medium (DMEM/HAMS F-12) alone with no DMSO, which yielded cell viability levels of approximately 0.83. This negative control was similar to the positive control, ascorbate which contained no DMSO, at approximately 0.85. Equol at 0.001 % (or 10 micrograms/ml in 0.002 % DMSO as the vehicle) displayed viability levels in the human dermal monolayer fibroblasts similar to that of the negative (no DMSO) and positive (ascorbate) controls. However, the potent natural androgen steroid hormone, 5α-DHT displayed the greatest cytotoxicity compared to all other treatment groups. When equol was added to the 5α-DHT samples \nin vitro,\n equol completely reversed the cytotoxic effects of 5α-DHT. This provides direct evidence that equol binds 5α-DHT in this \nin vitro\n human dermal monolayer fibroblast assay system and validates the \nin vivo\n evidence of equol biologically inactivating 5α-DHT's effects. Finally, by blocking the harmful effects of 5α-DHT in human dermal fibroblasts (cytotoxicity) and at the same time stimulating collagen deposition, this example demonstrates that equol has powerful effects on enhancing human skin health.\n\n\n \nExample 8:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis is an example of the effects of equol preventing the stimulatory effects of 5α-DHT in LNCAP prostate cancer cells \nin vitro\n from secreting prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a molecule known to be regulated by 5α-DHT, as measured by PSA ELISA. Treatment with 0.1, 1 or 10 nM 5α-DHT, 1, 10 and 100 nM equol or a combination of 5α-DHT with equol (0.1 nM 5α-DHT and 1 nM equol; 1 nM 5α-DHT and 10 nM equol or 10 nM 5α-DHT and 100 nM equol). Cytotoxicity, as assessed by MTT Assay, did not influence PSA production by LNCAP prostate cancer cells. As shown in \nFIGURE 18\n, 1, 10 or 100 nM Vehicle PSA levels did not differ from the No Treatment baseline. Treatment with 0.1, 1 or 10 nM 5α-DHT stimulated PSA secretion to maximal levels. PSA levels from cells treated with 1, 10, and 100 nM equol were below baseline, and did not differ significantly between groups. However, combinations of 10 nM 5α-DHT and 100 nM equol, as well as 1 nM 5α-DHT and 10 nM equol, abrogated the increase in PSA secretion, compared to 5α-DHT alone. Taken together with binding demonstrated in Example 1, this Example demonstrates that equol binds the 5α-DHT molecule biologically inactivates it in skin and in the prostate.\n\n\n \nExample 9:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis is an example of equol preventing the stimulatory effects of 5α-DHT \nin vivo.\n Rats were injected with 1 mg of equol for 25 consecutive days, and serum 5α-DHT levels and prostate weights were measured since it is known that the prostate is stimulated by circulating 5α-DHT. Adult (50 day-old) males (n = 16), purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA), were caged individually and housed in the Brigham Young University Vivarium and maintained on a 11-dark, 13-hour light schedule (lights on 0600-1900). Before purchase, the male animals were fed a diet containing approximately 200 ppm of isoflavones. At 50 days of age, upon arrival, the male rats were placed on a diet containing approximately 10 ppm of isoflavones; referred to hereafter as the Phyto-Free diet (Zeigler Bros., Gardnes, PA, USA). All animals remained on the Phyto-free diet until 215 days of age. At 150 days of age the rats were divided into two groups (control or equol treatments) that were matched by age and body weight. Starting at 190 days of age the male rats received a daily subcutaneous 0.1cc injection at the nape of the neck of vehicle DMSO) or equol at a dose of approximately 2.5 mg/kg for 25 consecutive days.\n\nThe body weights for each group were recorded weekly starting a 150 days of ago before the treatments were initiated, with weights obtained immediately before an after the treatments were administered. At 216 days of age the animals were anesthestized with Ketamine/acepromazine and blood was collected from the heart. Next the ventral prostate organ was dissected and weighed. The collected blood samples were centrifuged and serum was stored at -20° C until time of assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum testosterone, 5α-DHT, and 17β-estradiol were quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits purchased from Diagnostic System Laboratories (Webster, TX, USA). Luteininzing hormone (LH) was quantified by an assay utilizing standards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) pituitary hormone program. The samples were run in duplicate for each RIA, with internal control samples. In all RIAs, the control values were within their normal respective ranges. The intra-assay coefficients of variance for the assays were: testosterone = 6.0 %; for 5α-dihydrotestosterone = 8%, 17β-estradiol = 5 % and LH = 9 %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen LH and testosterone were quantified between the treatment groups there were no significant differences in these hormone levels (TABLE 6). Since LH is the gonadotrophin regulating testosterone synthesis from Leydig cells in the testes, this is not a surprising result. However, equol-injected animals displayed an approximately 50% decrease in serum 5α-DHT compared to vehicle-injected animals. Finally, when 17β-estradiol levels were determined there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. All hormone, levels were within normal ranges of that expected for this strain, age and sex of rat. Prostate weights were significantly decreased by approximately 20 % in the equol-injected males compared to control rats. This finding corresponds with the significant decrease in circulating 5α-DHT levels which are known to regulate prostatic cell proliferation, and hence, prostate weight. Thus, this \nin vivo\n study demonstrates that equol can contact and biologically inactive the 5α-DHT molecule as shown by the significant decrease in 5α-DHT levels in blood and significantly reduced prostate weights of equol-treated male rats. Finally, \nthe in vitro\n and \nin vivo\n studies reported above demonstrates that equol would be effective in treating skin and skin diseases/disorders that are regulated by the hormone 5α-DHT.\n\n \n \nTABLE 6.

In this study the effects of equol on the above parameters were compared to the natural female hormone, 17β-estradiol. Both equol and 17β-estradiol were used at 10 nM concentrations which corresponds to a normal range to study using \nin vitro\n experiments and represent an \nin vivo\n concentration range of circulating 0.1 tol.0 nM 17β-estradiol and 1 nM 5α-DHT in women, and 3 nM 5α-DHT men (see \nWilson JD et al, Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, 9th ed. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA, 1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing an organotypic three-dimensional dermal model, which closely resembles the intact dermis and allows for tissue-like deposition and maturation of the extracellular matrix by fibroblasts, equol significantly stimulated collagen type I (\nFIGURE 19\n) and collagen type III (\nFIGURE 20\n) compared to vehicle when assayed by FACS. These studies were performed partially as a control for the use of this methodology (i.e., FACS analysis) since equol has previously been shown to increase collagen deposition by dermal monolayer fibroblasts in culture. Only equol, but not 17β-estradiol, increased both collagen types I and III. Since the net deposition of extracellular matrix molecules is also affected by the presence and activity of matrix-degrading enzymes, the expression of MMP-3/stromelysin-1 by intracellular FACS was also measured (\nFIGURE 21\n). MMP-3 is an important enzyme which can degrade collagen and elastin, as well as other extracellular matrix constituents. Both equol and 17β-estradiol reduced MMP-3 protein expression. However, equol significantly decreased the expression of MMP-3 by 3.6-fold vs. 2.3-fold for 17β-estradiol compared to vehicle. This indicates that equol is an effective agent for inhibiting the matrix-degrading enzyme that in would enhance the expression of collagen and elastin. Since elastin is an important extracellular matrix molecule, along with collagen in the maintenance of good skin health for the prevention and treatment of wrinkles, equal was tested against 17β-estradiol in the FACS analysis. In the 3-D human dermal fibroblast cultures, equol significantly stimulated elastin 2.2-fold over vehicle levels while 17β-estradiol stimulated elastin production by 1.8-fold vs. the control (\nFIGURE 22\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, equol significantly stimulated \ncollagen type\n 1, collagen type III and elastin protein expression while significantly decreasing the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP-3. As shown in \nFIGURE 23\n, 17β-estradiol significantly increases the elastin-degrading elastase enzyme expression 1.9-fold vs. vehicle levels. However, equol was not different compared to the vehicle, demonstrating that equol promotes elastin protein expression without increasing degradation of elastin.\n\nFurther FACS analysis of the same 3-D human dermal fibroblast cultures was performed by staining the cells with propidium iodide (PI) (fluorescent DNA dye). The FACS analysis via PI-stained cells was able to detect by different markers the percentage of cells that were apoptotic (engaged in programmed-cell death) and the percentage of cycling human dermal fibroblasts in S- and G2M-phases of the cell cycle. \nFIGURE 24\n shows the cell cycle analysis for the percentage of apoptotic cells expressed in the 3-D cultures. There were no significant differences between the treatments (equol or 17β-estradiol) compared to vehicle. This demonstrates that equol or 17β-estradiol at 10 nM had no significant effect on apoptosis. However, the percentage of cycling human dermal fibroblasts in S- and G2M-phases of the cell cycle shows that equol, but not 17β-estradiol, significantly stimulated fibroblasts to proliferate at 1.5-fold compared to vehicle (\nFIGURE 25\n). This data set demonstrates that equol stimulates human dermal fibroblasts to proliferate, which is consistent with increased \ncollagen types\n 1 and III and elastin protein expression in the same human dermal fibroblast cells. Furthermore, these finding correspond with the doubling of collagen deposition in human dermal fibroblasts following the application of equol.\n\n\n \nExample 11:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis is an example the effect of equol in regulating skin tail temperature. This was tested by injecting 3 mg of equol for 5 consecutive days in adult male rats and quantifying skin tail temperatures at the end of the treatments. In this experiment rodent skin tail temperature was determine by quantifying skin temperature by sensor/radio telemetry. Male Long-Evans male rats were purchased from Charles Rivers Laboratories at 50 days of age. The animals were placed on a diet containing very low isoflavone levels (10-15 ppm of isoflavones per gram of diet) and allowed ad lib access to this diet and water throughout the experiment. At approximately 130 days of age the male rats were observed for sexual activity by mating with receptive females. All males used in this study were sexually active by mating and inseminated receptive females that in turn become pregnant and subsequently delivered normal size litters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt approximately 160 days of age the male rats were matched by body weight and placed into either a control or equol treatment group. As this time the rats were handled for 5 to 10 minutes per day to habituate the animals to being handled. Handling consisted of placing the rat on the supine forearm surface of laboratory personnel. This handling protocol was continued each day for approximately 2 weeks or when the animal reached 174 days of age. At 175 days of the were handled as before, but 1-inch wide silk surgical tape was placed around the animal's tail approximately 1 inch from the base of the tail to simulate the placement of the temperature sensor/transponder. This handling/tape protocol took place daily from 175-180 days of age.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 175 days of age, each animal received a 0.1 cc subcutaneous injection at the nape of the neck of either vehicle (DMSO), or a solution of 3 mg of equol. At this time the animals weighed approximately 700 grams, therefore the dose was about 4.3 mg/kg of equol per day. The treatment injections were given for 5 consecutive days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the 5\nth\n day of the treatment injections (or 180 days of age) tail skin temperature was quantified by an electronic sensor/transponder taped to the base of the animal's tail. Thirty seconds after the sensor/transponder was taped to the tail the skin temperature was recorded by radiotelemetry (± 0.1 °C). The same sensor/transponder was used for all of the animals in the two treatment groups in recording skin-tail temperatures. The rats treated with equal had a 1.5°C decrease in skin temperature, compared to control rats (\nFIGURE 26\n). Control group, n = 5; equol group, n = 4, p < 0.025. This finding demonstrates that equol can be used to treat hot flushes associated with perimenopause symptoms or in post-menopausal women.\n\n\n \nExample 12:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example deomonstrates the effects of equol on skin collagen deposition by measuring Collagen Type I C-Propeptide from human dermal monolayer fibroblasts \nin vitro\n treated with 10 nM equol or 10 nM 17β-estradiol as in the FACS analysis experiments. There was no cytotoxicity when 10 nM equol or 10 nM 17β-estradiol was added to the tissue cultures. Treatment with 10 nM of equol significantly stimulated collagen deposition 1-8-fold compared to vehicle (\nFIGURE 27\n), while 17β-estradiol treatment was similar to that found with ascorbate treatment. This example demonstrates that 10 nM equol significantly stimulates collagen deposition by human dermal fibroblasts.\n\n\n \nExample 13:\n\n\n \n \n \nThis is an example of the effects of vehicle (ethanol), equol-racemic or 99% S-equol as evaluated with the Irritection\n®\n Assay System in order to predict its potential to cause ocular and dermal irritation. To achieve this objective, standard volume-dependent dose-response studies were performed with the Ocular and Dermal Irritection test methods. The proprietary Ocular and Dermal Irritection assays are standardized and quantitative \nin vitro\n acute ocular and dermal irritation tests which utilize changes of relevant macromolecules to predict acute ocular and dermal irritancy of chemicals and chemical formulations. The Ocular and Dermal Irritection assay methods can be readily employed to evaluate multiple samples at varying volumes or concentrations and provide highly reproducible results. Thus, these tests serve as extremely useful screening tools that facilitate all stages of raw material selection, formulation development and final product selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ocular Irritection assay, depicted schematically in \nFIGURE 28\n, provides significant advances over the \nin\n vivo Draize test method. The Draize eye irritation assay has been criticized because of the large variability of results obtained from different laboratories that have analyzed the same specimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Dermal Irritection assay, depicted schematically in \nFIGURE 29\n, is based on the principle that chemical compounds will promote measurable changes in target biomolecules and macromolecular structures. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the processes of protein denaturation and disaggregation that are induced in this \nin vitro\n assay mimic the effects that are produced when these types of irritants are applied to the skin. Consequently, this \nin vitro\n test may be employed to predict the \nin vivo\n toxic effects of chemicals and formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the analysis on 4% (v/v) ethanol in physiological buffered saline (PBS) vehicle, 4% (w/v) equol-racemic in vehicle and 4% (w/v) s-equol (99 % purity) in vehicle are shown below. The results of the study indicate that the sample of vehicle was classified as a borderline minimal/mild ocular irritant with an IDE score of 12.6. A similar volume-dependent dose-response study was performed with the Dermal Irritection test method. The results demonstrated that the sample was predicted to be a non-irritant with a HIE score of 0.49. TABLES 7 and 8 present a summary of results for the vehicle.\n\n \nTABLE 7.

A standard volume-dependent dose-response study was performed with the Ocular Irritection test method. The following volumes of neat sample were applied for analysis: 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 µl. The results of the study indicated that the sample of s-equol was classified as a mild ocular irritant with an IDE score of 16.4. A similar volume-dependent dose-response study was performed with the Dermal Irritection test method. The results demonstrated that the sample was predicted to be a non-irritant with a HIE score of 0.15. The raw test materials: ethanol vehicle, equol-racemic and S-equol were analyzed in the Ocular and Dermal Irritection tests at 4 percent. Since the vehicle results displayed similar values to that of the equol results (racemic equol or S-equol), this demonstrates that most of the irritant effects seen in the equol samples can be attributed to the vehicle. Therefore, for ocular and dermal applications, racemic equol and S-equol are classified as non-irritating based upon the results for skin/cosmetic relevance.\n\n \nTABLE 11.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to new compounds derived from trisubstituted pyrroles and conformationally restricted intermediate aromatic rings, with the procedures for their preparation and with the use thereof as drugs for the treatment of cancer in pharmaceutical compositions due to their inhibitory action over class I and class II histone deacetylases.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHistone deacetylases (HDAC) constitute an interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer (cf. \nP. A. Marks et al. Nature Rev. Cancer2001, 1, 194\n; \nJ. E. Bolden et al. Nature Rev. Drug Discov.2006, 5, 769\n; \nP. Gallinari et al. Cell Res. 2007, 17, 195\n; \nK. B. Glaser Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007, 74, 659\n; \nL. Pan et al. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2007, 4, 337\n; \nM. Haberland et al. Nature Rev. Genetics 2009, 10, 32\n; \nY. Zhang et al. Curr. Med. Chem. 2008, 15, 2840\n; \nS. Ropero, M. Esteller Mol. Oncol. 2007, 1, 19\n) and other diseases such as those related to central nervous system (cf. \nA. G. Kazantsev, L. M. Thompson Nature Rev. Drug Discov.2006, 7, 854\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral families of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been designed, whose general structures can be found in different reviews (cf. A.\n Villar-Garea, M. Esteller Int. J. Cancer 2004, 112, 171\n; \nT. A. Miller et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 5097\n;\n T. Suzuki, N. Miyata Curr. Med. Chem.2005, 12, 2867\n; \nM. Paris et al. J. Med. Chem.2008, 51, 1505\n). The general structure of these inhibitors consists of a cyclic structure, a spacer and a chelating group capable of binding to the Zn (II) cation of the active center of the different HDAC isoforms that belong to the class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8), class II (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9 and HDAC10) and class IV (HDAC11). Despite having a similar inhibition mode, occasionally some selectivity in the inhibition of different HDAC isoforms has been observed (cf. \nJ. C. Wong et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 5586\n; \nG. Estiu et al. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 51, 2898\n). The mentioned selectivity is of therapeutic interest (cf. \nK. V. Butler, A. P. Kozikowski Curr. Pharm. Design 2008, 14, 505\n; \nT. C. Karagiannis, A. EI-Osta Leukemia 2007, 21, 61\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the chelating groups capable of binding to the Zn cation in the different isoforms of HDAC, several functional groups have been developed, such as, \ninter alia,\n carboxylic acids, hydroxamic acids, methyl and trifluoromethyl ketones, epoxides, sulfides and disulfides, o-aminobenzamides, N-hydroxyformyl derivatives, mercaptoamides, sulfones and phosphones (cf. M. Paris et al. \nop. cit\n.; T. Suzuki, N. Miyata, \nop. cit\n.). As spacer groups that connect the chelating group with the opposite side of the inhibitors, aliphatic linear chains and aromatic and heteroaromatic groups have been described. As examples of HDACis that incorporate aromatic and heteroaromatic spacers the following can be mentioned: Belinostat (PXD101), Panobinostat (LBH-589), CRA-024781, MGDC0103, Entinostat (MS-275, also described as SNDX-275), ITF2357, JNJ-16241199, Tacedinaline (CI-994) and LAQ-824 (cf. M. Paris et al. \nop. cit.\n and cited references).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, as terminal groups that are on the opposite side of the chelating groups of the inhibitors, several cyclic, heteroaromatic and aromatic systems have been studied (cf. M. Paris et al. \nop. cit\n.; T. A. Miller \nop. cit\n.; T. Suzuki, N. Miyata \nop. cit\n.). In particular, the following groups have been used for this purpose or as spacers: 2,4-substituted-1\nH\n-pyrroles, with aroyl groups in position 4 (cf.\n S. Massa et al. J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 2845\n; \nS. Massa et al. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 2069\n;\n A. Mai et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 512\n) or cinnamoyl groups at the same position (cf. D. Chen et al. Benzimidazole derivatives: Preparation and pharmaceutical applications. \n \nWO/2005/028447, 2005\n \n; \nS. Inoue et al. Cancer Res. 2006, 66, 6785\n). Likewise, concerning the monosubstituted 1\nH\n-pyrroles, the use of \nN\n-(7-(hydroxyamino)-7-oxoheptyl)-1\nH\n-pyrrol-2-carboxamide as HDACi has been described (cf.\n Y. Dai et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003, 13, 1897\n). Finally, some of the authors of the present invention have described the synthesis of tri- and tetrasubstituted 1\nH\n-pyrroles (cf. \nA. Arrieta et al. J. Org. Chem. 2007, 72, 4313\n) as well as their use as terminal groups in the obtention of HDACis (cf. \nA. Zubia et al. Oncogene 2009, 28, 1477\n; \nD. Otaegui et al. Cancer Chemother. Pharm. 2009, 64, 153\n;\n D. Otaegui et al. J. Chromatography B 2008, 870, 109\n; F. P. Cossío et al. Nuevos derivados pirrólicos con actividad inhibidora de desacetilasas de histonas \n \nWO/2007/074176, 2005\n \n). However, in that case only the activity of inhibitors containing pyrrole rings with linear aliphatic chains as spacers is described. The activity of 3,5-substituted 2-carboxamide-1\nH\n-pyrroles connected with the chelating groups through structures containing aromatic or heteroaromatic rings is unknown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin this context, the present invention describes the chemical synthesis and the HDACi activity of novel trisubstituted pyrrolic derivatives connected with the chelating groups through aromatic and heteroaromatic groups, that show inhibitory activity against several HDAC isoforms, in particular those belonging to class I and II.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nObject of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention has as an object the pyrrole derivatives of general formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nor salts, solvates or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, another object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a compound of general formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of general formula (I), or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, for use as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of general formula (I), or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, for use as a medicament for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to the use of a compound of general formula (I), or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of treating cancer comprising of administering to a patient needing such treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of general formula (I) or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a particular embodiment, the compounds of general formula (I) are useful for the treatment of various types of cancer by restricting tumor growth or other processes that stop the development of primary or metastatic tumors, through the inhibition of certain histone deacetylases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, this invention has as an object a pharmaceutical composition comprising of at least one compound of general formula (I), or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDetailed description of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFirst, the present invention provides compounds derived from 2,3,5-trisubstituted 1\nH\n-pyrrole rings that have the following formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nwhere:\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n and R\n2\n represent, independently of each other, an optionally substituted C\n6\n-C\n10\n aryl radical or an optionally substituted heteroaryl radical,\n \nA and M represent, independently of each other, a methylene group or a single bond, in which case the adjacent aromatic ring would be attached directly to the amide group,\n \nThe Y=Z group represents indistinctly an oxygen atom (-O-), a sulfur atom (-S-), a cis-vinylidene group (-CH=CH-), an imino group (-N=CH- or -CH=N-), or a methine group with a sp\n2\n-hybridized carbon atom (=CH-),\n \nX represents indistinctly a methine group (=CH-), a cis-vinylidene group (-CH=CH-) or a nitrogen atom (=N-),\n \nW represents equally a hydroxyl group (-OH), an optionally substituted C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group, an optionally substituted heteroaryl group or an optionally substituted C\n6\n-C\n10\n aryl group,\n \nor a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to a preferred embodiment, R\n1\n and R\n2\n represent, independently of each other, an optionally substituted phenyl group or an optionally substituted 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl group.

For the purposes of this invention, the heteroaryl radical may be a monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring system, which may include condensed ring systems; and nitrogen, carbon or sulfur atoms in the heteroaryl radical may be optionally oxidized; and the nitrogen atom may be optionally quaternized. Examples of such heteroaryl include, but are not limited to, benzimidazole, benzothiazole, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, isothiazole, imidazole, indole, purine, quinoline, thiadiazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halogen\" refers to bromine, chlorine, iodine or fluorine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs commonly understood in this technical area, there may be a degree of substitution in the radicals defined above. Thus, there may be substitution in either group of the present invention. References in this document with respect to substituted groups in the groups of the present invention indicate that the specified radical may be substituted in one or more positions available with one or more substituents. These substituents include, for example and in a non limiting sense, C\n1-6\n alkyl, C\n6\n-C\n10\n aryl, heteroaryl, halogen, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, -N(R')(R\"), -OR', -SR', -SOR', -SO\n2\nR' -C(O)R', -C(O)OR', -C(O)N(R')(R\"), -OC(O)R'; where R' and R\" are independently selected from hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and trifluoromethyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be in the form of salts, preferably as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as solvates or as prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts which, when administered to the recipient, can provide (directly or indirectly) a compound as described in the present document. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" preferably refers to compositions and molecular entities that are physiologically tolerable and do not usually produce an allergic reaction or a similar unfavorable reaction as gastric disorders, dizziness and suchlike, when administered to a human or animal. Preferably, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" means it is approved by a regulatory agency of a state or federal government or is included in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of salts can be accomplished by methods known in the art. For example, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the original compound, which contains basic residues, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are prepared, for example, by reacting free base forms of these compounds with the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of both. In general, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, e.g. hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate salts and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulfonate and p-toluenesulfonate salts. Examples of base addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, magnesium, aluminum and lithium salts, and organic salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, \nN\n,\nN\n-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine, glucamine and basic salts of aminoacids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"prodrug\" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted \nin vivo\n into the compounds of the invention. Experts in the art would readily produce such derivatives, and include, depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, esters of metallic salt sulfonates, carbamates and amides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"solvate\" according to this invention is to be understood as any form of the active compound of the invention which has another molecule (most likely a polar solvent) attached to it through noncovalent bonds. Examples of solvates include hydrates and alcoholates, for example methanolate. The compounds of the invention can be in crystalline form, either as free compounds or as solvates. Methods of solvation are known within the art. In a particular embodiment the solvate is a hydrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts, solvates and prodrugs can be prepared by methods known in the state of the art. Note that the non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs also fall within the scope of the invention because they can be useful in preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention also seek to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a carbon enriched in \n11\nC, \n13\nC or \n14\nC or a \n15\nN enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention refers to different procedures to obtain compounds of general formula (I). The following methods A to C describe the procedures for obtaining compounds of general formula (I), or salts, solvates or prodrugs thereof, among which include compounds of formula (la).\n\n\n \n\n\nMethod A\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethod A represents a procedure for the preparation of compounds of general formula (la):\n\n \n \n\nwhere R\n1\n, R\n2\n, A, M, X, Y and Z have the meaning given above, which comprises reacting:\n\n \n \n \na) A compound of formula (II);\n\n \n \n \n \nb) A compound of formula (III),\n\n \n \n\nwhere R\n3\n is a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group;\n \nc) At least one reagent for the activation of the carboxyl group; and\n \nd) A tertiary amine, preferably a tertiary amine selected from among the cyclic or acyclic aliphatic amines with C\n3\n-C\n10\n carbon atoms and the alkano-aromatic amines with C\n9\n-C\n15\n carbon atoms,\n \n\nto obtain a compound of general formula (IV),\n\n \n \n\nand reacting the obtained product (IV) with a mixture of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and phenolphthalein in the presence of an excess of sodium methoxide in methanol.\n    \n \n \n \nFor the aims of the invention, the reaction mixture made up of the four compounds of phases a) to d) can be made by adding one of the components to the mixture formed by the three other components in an organic solvent and at a temperature ranging from -85°C to +25°C, preferably at temperatures close to 0°C. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred until completion of the reaction, while reaching room temperature. Upon completion of the amide formation, the ester obtained following the mentioned procedure is added to a mixture of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and phenolphtalein in the presence of an excess of sodium methoxide in methanol.

After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred until completion of the reaction, while reaching room temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, after the corresponding isolation and purification methods, compounds of general formula (I) are obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods A-C may include protection and deprotection steps of functional groups, if necessary. Protecting groups and methods of protection and deprotection are well known to the skilled in the art. Illustrative examples of such protecting groups are described in \nGreen T.W. et al. \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", 3rd Edition (1999), Ed. John Wiley & Sons\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a particular embodiment, when using a trityl group (triphenylmethyl) as a thiol protecting group in any of the compounds of the invention, the deprotection reaction is carried out preferably by reaction with a trisubstituted silane, preferably triethylsilane, an acid, preferably trifluoroacetic acid, a suitable organic solvent, preferably dichloromethane, and a salt of basic character, preferably sodium bicarbonate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a common element for methods A-C, the reagent or group of reagents for the activation of the carboxyl group is preferably oxalyl chloride, phenyl dichlorophosphate, diethyl cyanophosphonate (DEPC), or the 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and \nN\n-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-\nN\n'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) system. Also, the organic solvent is preferably a polar organic solvent, most preferred is \nN,N-\ndimethylformamide or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and the tertiary amine is preferably selected among triethylamine, pyridine, \nN\n-methylpyrrolidine or \nN\n-methylmorpholine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of compounds of formula (II) described above is performed by a process which comprises reacting a mixture formed by:\n\n \n \n \na) A α,β-unsaturated carbonylic compound with the following formula (VIII):\n\n \n \n\nwhere R\n1\n and R\n2\n have the meanings indicated for compounds of formula (I);\n \nb) An ester of the nitroacetic acid of general formula (IX):\n\n \n \n\nwhere R\n3\n has the meaning given for compounds of formulas (III) and (IV); and\n \nc) A primary, secondary or tertiary amine, or an inorganic base. Preferably a cyclic or acyclic aliphatic or monounsaturated tertiary amine. More preferably, triethylamine, \nN,N\n-diisopropyl ethylamine (DIPEA), \nN\n-methyl morpholine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), or mixtures thereof.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe resulting mixture is stirred at a temperature ranging from +50°C to +100°C. Upon completion of the reaction, the resulting product, consisting of a mixture of diastereomers of α-nitro-δ-oxoester of general formula (X):\n\n \n \n\nmay be oxidized to a compound of general formula (XI). In a particular embodiment the oxidation step is performed in the presence of potassium permanganate, dimethyldioxirane, potassium peroxomonosulfate (Oxone\n™\n), titanium (III) chloride, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), freshly prepared chromium (II) chloride or mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment the compound of general formula (X) is treated with an excess of sodium methoxide in methanol or sodium ethoxide in ethanol at a temperature ranging from -25°C to +50°C, preferably at temperatures close to +25°C. The nitronate thus obtained is hydrolyzed in the presence of a strong acid and a protic solvent at a temperature ranging from -85°C to 0°C, preferably at temperatures close to -25°C. For the purposes of the invention, a preferred embodiment refers to the use of methanol and sulfuric acid to yield the corresponding α,δ-dioxoesters of general formula (XI):\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n1\nH\n-Pyrrole-2-carboxylic acids of general formula (II) are obtained by treatment of previously described esters of formula (XI) with ammonium hydroxide or an ammonium salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid of less than 5 carbon atoms in the presence of acetic acid at a temperature ranging from +25°C to + 100°C, and subsequent hydrolysis, preferably in the presence of an alkaline hydroxide, water, an alcohol and a cyclic or acyclic ether, at a temperature between 0°C and 100°C, preferably at temperatures close to the range from +50°C to +100°C yielding, after the corresponding treatment, the compounds of general formula (II).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of general formula (I) or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, for use as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of general formula (I) or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, for use as a medicament for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to the use of a compound of general formula (I) or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mechanism of action of these compounds is explained by their antagonist properties against histone deacetylases involved in the regulation of processes related to apoptosis, cell growth, tumor progression, cancer metastasis, cell adhesion and others. These properties prevent the binding of HDACs to their natural ligands, which can be histones or cytoplasmic proteins such as tubulin, as well as their normal catalytic activation, namely the deacetylation of ε-N-acetyl lysine residues present in these proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of general formula (I) or a salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be used with at least another drug to provide a combination therapy. This other drug or drugs may be part of the same composition, or may be provided as a separate composition and can be administered at the same time or at different times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"treatment\" or \"treating\" in the context of this document means administration of a compound or a formulation of the invention to prevent, improve or eliminate the disease or one or more symptoms associated with the disease. \"Treatment\" also encompasses preventing, improving or eliminating the physiological sequelae of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"excipient\" refers to a vehicle, diluent or adjuvant that is administered with the active ingredient. Such pharmaceutical excipients can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and similars. Water or saline aqueous solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol, particularly for injectable solutions, are preferably used as vehicles. Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles are described in \"\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\" by E.W. Martin, 1995\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid composition (tablets, pills, capsules, granules, etc.) or liquid composition (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) for oral, topical or parenteral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions are in oral delivery form. Pharmaceutical forms suitable for oral administration may be tablets and capsules and may contain conventional excipients known in the art such as binders, for example syrup, gum arabic, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, cornstarch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; lubricants for the preparation of tablets, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycolate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid oral compositions can be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or preparation of tablets. Repeated blending operations can be used to distribute the active ingredient in all the compositions that use large amounts of fillers. Such operations are conventional in the art. The tablets can be prepared, for example, by dry or wet granulation and optionally can be coated by well known methods in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular using a enteric coating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions can also be adapted for parenteral administration, such as sterile solutions, suspensions or lyophilized products in the appropriate unit dosage form. Suitable excipients such as fillers, buffering agents or surfactants can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mentioned formulations will be prepared using standard methods such as those described or referred to in the Spanish and U.S. Pharmacopoeias and similar reference texts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the effective amount of a compound of the invention to be administered will depend on the relative efficacy of the compound chosen, the severity of the disorder being treated and the patient's weight. However, the active compounds will normally be administered one or more times a day for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with typical total daily doses in the range from 0.01 up to 1000 mg/kg/day\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to facilitate the understanding of the preceding ideas, some examples of embodiment of the present invention are described below. These examples are merely illustrative.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nPreparation of 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, with the following structural formula:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of (2\nE\n)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one (5 g, 20.98 mmol) and ethyl nitroacetate (2.32 ml, 20.98 mmol) in triethylamine (8.77 ml, 62.94 mmol) was stirred at 75°C for 4h.
