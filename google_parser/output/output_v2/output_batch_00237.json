Description\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel pyrimidine compound, a production process thereof, and a pharmaceutical preparation containing it and use thereof.\n\n\n \nPrior Art\n\n\n \n \n \nAdenosine is an important regulatory factor involved in many intracellular metabolisms in the living body such as regulation of energy levels, cAMP levels, opening and closing potassium channels, and inflow of calcium ions into cells, and its interaction with G protein-coupled adenosine receptors on the surface of a cell is essential for exhibiting these physiological activities. Adenosine receptors were classified under two subtypes, A\n1\n receptor and A\n2\n receptor based on the involvement in adenylate cyclase (\nJ. Neurochem., 33, 999-1003, (1979\n)), and thereafter, the A\n2\n receptor has been classified under two subtypes, A\n2A\n and A\n2B\n, based on the affinity for A\n2\n receptor agonists, NECA and CGS-21680 (\nMol. Pharmacol., 29, 331-346, (1986\n); \nJ. Neurochem., 55, 1763-1771, (1990\n)). Four receptor subtypes, A\n1\n, A\n2\n (A\n2A\n and A\n2B\n) and A\n3\n, have been identified until now. The A\n1\n receptor is a protein coupled with G\ni/o\n family\n\nproteins. It serves to inhibit the adenylate cyclase as a result of binding with a ligand to thereby decrease the cAMP level and serves to activate phospholipase C (PLC) to thereby promote the production of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP\n3\n) and to release the intracellular calcium ions. The A\n3\n receptor is a receptor serving to decrease the cAMP level and to activate PLC to thereby promote the IP\n3\n production and the release of calcium ions, as the A\n1\n receptor. In contrast, the A\n2A\n and A\n2B\n receptors are receptors serving to activate the adenylate cyclase and promote the production of cAMP. There is a report that the A\n2B\n receptor couples with PLC via a G\nq\n/G\n11\n protein or promotes the production of IP\n3\n and the flow of calcium ions into cells (\nJ. Clin. Invest., 96, 1979-1986 (1995\n)). These subtypes are different from one another in their distribution in tissues; that is, the A\n1\n receptor occurs relatively abundantly, for example, in the heart, aorta and bladder, the A\n2A\n receptor is distributed relatively abundantly, for example, in the eyeballs and skeletal muscles, the A\n3\n receptor, for example, in the spleen, uterus, and prostate, and the A\n2B\n receptor, for example, in the proximal colon, and subsequently in the eyeballs, lung, uterus and bladder (\nBr. J. Pharmacol., 118, 1461-1468 (1996\n)). It is believed that these adenosine receptor subtypes can exhibit specific functions, respectively, due to the difference in distribution in the tissues as well as the difference in adenosine level among the locations and the difference in affinity for the ligand among the subtypes. Adenosine is involved in a variety of physiological functions such as platelet aggregation, heart rate, smooth muscle tonus, inflammation, release of neurotransmitters, neurotransmission, hormone release, cell-differentiation, cell growth, cell death, and DNA biosynthesis. Accordingly, the relation between adenosine and diseases such as central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, respiratory diseases, and immune diseases has been suggested, and the efficacy of agonists/antagonists of the adenosine receptors on these diseases has been expected. Antagonists against the adenosine receptors, particularly those against the adenosine A\n2\n receptor have been discussed as effective as an agent for treating or preventing diabetes mellitus, diabetic complications, diabeticretinopathy, obesity or asthma and have been expected useful as, for example, a hypoglycemic agent, an agent for improving glucose intolerance, an insulin sensitizer, a hypotensive agent, a diuretic agent, an antidepressant, an agent for treating osteoporosis, an agent for treating Parkinson's disease, an agent for treating Alzheimer' s disease, an agent for treating an inflammatory bowel disease, or an agent for treating Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain important reports have been made on the relation between the adenosine A\n2\n receptor and the intestinal tract. For example, certain reports have been made that the A\n2\n receptor mediates a colon longitudinal muscle relaxation action (\nNaunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 359, 140-146 (1999\n)), and that the A\n1\n receptor, and the A\n2B\n receptor occurring in the longitudinal muscle mediate a relaxation action of adenosine against the contraction of distal colon longitudinal muscle of a guinea pig (\nBr. J. Pharmacol., 129, 871-876 (2000\n)). The relation between the A\n2B\n receptor and constipation and other diseases of the digestive organs has been recently found, and a report has been made on an A\n2B\n receptor antagonist useful as a defecation-promoting agent and an agent for treating or preventing various types of constipation (\n \nJP-A 2000-126489\n \n). Such A\n2B\n receptor antagonists do not induce diarrhea, have an excellent defecation-promoting action and are expected as an agent for treating and/or preventing various constipation. They are also expected as being useful for treating and/or preventing irritable bowel syndrome, constipation accompanying irritable bowel syndrome, organic constipation or constipation accompanying enteroparalytic ileus and for evacuating intestinal tracts at the time of examination of digestive tracts or before and after an operation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, in the formation of clinical condition of Parkinson's disease, it has been importantly reported that, adenosine is extremely closely involved through the adenosine A\n2A\n receptor in addition to dopamine. For instance, it has been reported that the effects for improving the symptoms of Parkinson's disease will be enhanced by use of L-DOPA together with theophylline which is known as a non-selective adenosine receptorantagonist (\nJ. Pharm. Pharmacol., 46, 515-517, (1994\n)). Also, it has been reported that selective adenosine A\n2A\n receptor\n\nantagonists are effective to various kinds of Parkinson's disease animal models (\n \nJP 1994-211856A\n \n). Parkinson' s disease is caused by the degradation or death of dopaminergic neurons projected from the compact layer of midbrain substantia nigra to the corpus striatum. Although the progress of the disease cannot be prevented, the symptomatic treatment with L-DOPA preparations is nevertheless a fundamental treatment making up for a shortage to dompamine. However, the long-term usage of the L-DOPA preparations will reduce the effectiveness thereof and produce some side effects such as involuntary movements and mental symptoms. Therefore, the biggest problem is that sufficient therapeuticeffectscannot be attained by the L-DOPA preparations. The distribution of adenosine A\n2A\n receptors in the brain is confined in the corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle (\nEur. J. Pharmacol., 168, 243-246 (1989\n)), so that the adenosine A\n2A\n receptors have been estimated to play an important role in motor function control in the corpus striatum. In addition, it has been reported that the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the compact layer of midbrain substantia nigra does not affect the adenosine A\n2A\n receptor binding ability of the corpus striatum and there is no difference between Parkinson's disease subjects and normal healthy subjects with respect to the total number of adenosine A\n2A\n receptors (\nNeuroscience, 42, 697-706, 1991\n). Recently, it has been also reported that selective adenosine A\n2A\n receptor antagonists are harmless and improve the motor functions of the subjects suffering from progressive Parkinson's disease without exaggerating dyskinesia with L-DOPA preparations (\nNeurology, 58 (suppl. 3) S21. 001 (2002.4\n)). As is evident from these findings, it is expected that the adenosine A\n2A\n receptor antagonists are useful as therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing compounds have been reported as those having antagonistic action on adenosine A\n2A\n and/or adenosine A\n2B\n receptors:\n\n \n \n \n(1) Compounds represented by the following formulae:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) A purine derivative represented by the formula:\n\n \n \n\n(wherein R\n1\n represents (1) the formula:\n\n \n \n\n(wherein X represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkyl group which may be substituted, a lower alkoxy group which may be substituted, etc. ; and R\n5\n and R\n6\n are the same as or different from each other and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group which may be substituted, a saturated or unsaturated cycloalkyl group having three to eight carbon atoms which may be substituted, etc.) or (2) a 5 or 6-membered aromatic ring which may have one or more substituents and a hetero atom; W represents the formula:\n\n-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, -CH=CH- or -C≡C-; R\n2\n represents an amino group which may be substituted with a lower alkyl group which may be substituted, etc. ; R\n3\n represents a cycloalkyl group having three to eight carbon atoms which may be substituted, an aryl group which may be substituted, etc.; and R\n4\n represents a lower alkyl group which may be substituted, etc.), a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof or a hydrate of them (\n \nJP-A 11-263789\n \n).\n \n(3) A purine compound represented by the formula:\n\n \n \n\n(wherein R\n1\n represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having one to eight carbon atoms which may be substituted, etc.; R\n2\n represents an amino group which may be substituted with an alkyl group having one to eight carbon atoms, etc.; R\n3\n represents an alkynyl group having three to eight carbon atoms which may be substituted with a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group or an alkyl group having one to four carbon atoms, etc. ; Ar represents an aryl group which may be substituted, a heteroaryl group which may be substituted, etc.; and Q and W are the same as or different from each other and each represents N or CH), a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof or a hydrate of them (\n \nJP-A 11-188484\n \n).\n \n(4) A\n2B\n receptor antagonists described in \nDrug Development Research, 48: 95-103 (1999\n) and \nJ.

Pharmacol., 182, 327-334 (1990\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe adenosine A\n2A\n receptor antagonist compounds identified by measuring on their binding abilities to the receptors in Test Examples 1 to 3, the salts thereof, solvates of them, or pharmaceutical compositions containing those were evaluated for effect on haloperidol-induced catalepsy by the method described below. That is, the experiment was conducted by eight 5-week-old male ICR mice (available from Charles River) per group. Haloperidol (manufactured by Sigma Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in a 6.1% tartaric acid solution and the resulting solution in a dose of 1 mg/kg was then intraperitoneally administered to the mice. The test compound was used as a 0.5% MC suspension. 1.5 hours after the intraperitoneal administration of haloperidol, each of the suspension with the test compound and the suspension without the test compound (control) was orally administered to the mice (0.1 ml per 10 g of mouse body weight). 1 hour after the administration of the test compound, the degree of catalepsy was measured with respect to each of the mice such that a pair of only forelimbs and a pair of only hindlimbs of each mouse were placed by turns on a stand 4.5 cm in height and 10 cm in width. 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of each of the test compounds were orally administered. Catalepsy scores and criterions are as follows.\n\n\n \nScore Duration of catalepsy\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n0: When the pair of only forelimbs and the pair of only hindlimbs are independently placed on the stand, the duration of such a posture of each pair for less than 5 seconds.\n\n\n1: The duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n placed on the stand was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds, and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was less than 5 seconds.\n\n \n \n \n2: The duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was 10 or more seconds, and the duration of such a posture of the pair hindlimbs was less than 5 seconds.\n \n3: The duration of the posture in which both the forelimbs and hindlimbs were being placed on the stand was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds; or the duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was less than 5 seconds and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was 5 or more seconds.\n \n4 : The duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was 10 or more seconds and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds; or the duration of the posture in which the forelimbs were being placed on the stand was 5 or more seconds but less than 10 seconds and the duration of such a posture of the hindlimbs was 10 or more seconds.\n \n5: The duration of the posture in which both the forelimbs and hindlimbs were being placed on the stand was 10 or more seconds.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe effects of the compound were determined by making a comparison between the score of the control group and the score of the test group in which the test compound was administered. A significant difference was analyzed by Dunnett's-test.

Description\n\n\n\n\n HETEROCYCYL-SUBSTITUTED-ALKYLAMINO PHENYL DERIVATIVES. THEIR PREPARATION AND USE AS MEDICAMENTS \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to heterocyclyl-substituted alkylamino phenyl derivatives, to processes for the preparation thereof, to medicaments comprising them as well as to their use for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of 5HT7 receptor mediated diseases or conditions. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of proteins and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of proteins that has been the subject of extensive study is the family of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) receptors.\n\n\nThe 5-HT7 receptor discovered in 1993 belongs to this family and has attracted great interest as a valuable new drug target ( Terron, J.A. Idrugs, 1998, vol. 1 , no. 3, pages 302-310: \"The 5HT7 receptor: A target for novel therapeutic avenues?\"). 5-HT7 receptors have been cloned from rat, mouse, guinea pig and human cDNA and exhibit a high degree of interspecies homology (approx. 95%), but it is unique in that it has a low sequence homology with other 5-HT receptors (less than 40%). Its expression pattern, in particular structures of the central nervous system (CNS) (highest in hypothalamus in particular suprachiasmatic nuclei and thalamus) and other peripheral tissues (spleen, kidney, intestinal, heart and coronary arthery), implicates the 5-HT7 receptor in a variety of functions and pathologies. This idea is reinforced by the fact that several therapeutic agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, typical and atypical antipsychotics and some 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, display moderate to high affinity for both recombinant and functional 5- HT7 receptors. \n\n\nFunctionally, the 5-HT7 receptor has been implicated in regulation of circadian rhythms in mammals (Lovenberg, T.W. et al. Neuron, 1993, 1 1 :449-458 \"A novel adenylyl cyclase-activating serotonin receptor (5-HT7) implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms\"). It is known that disruption of circadian rhythms is related to a \n\n number of CNS disorders including depression, seasonal affective disorder, sleep disorders, shift worker syndrome and jet lag among others. \n\n\nDistribution and early pharmacological data also suggest that the 5-HT7 receptor is involved in the vasodilatation of blood vessels. This has been demonstrated in vivo (Terron, J.A., Br J Pharmacol, 1997, 121 :563-571 \"Role of 5-HT7 receptors in the long lasting hypotensive response induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat\"). Thus selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists have a potential as novel hypertensive agents. \n\n\nThe 5-HT7 receptor has also been related with the pathophysiology of migraine through smooth muscle relaxation of cerebral vessels (Schoeffter, P. et al., 1996, Br J Pharmacol, 1 17:993-994 ; Terron, J.A., 2002, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 439:1 -1 1 \"Is the 5-HT7 receptor involved in the pathogenesis and prophylactic treatment of migraine?\"). In a similar manner, involvement of 5-HT7 in intestinal and colon tissue smooth muscle relaxation makes this receptor a target for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (De Ponti, F. et al., 2001 , Drugs, 61 :317-332 \"Irritable bowel syndrome. New agents targeting serotonin receptor subtypes \"). Recently, it has also been related to urinary incontinence ( British J. of Pharmacology, Sept. 2003, 140(1 ) 53-60: \"Evidence for the involvement of central 5HT-7 receptors in the micurition reflex in anaeshetized female rats\"). \n\n\nIn view of the potential therapeutic applications of agonists or antagonists of the 5HT7 receptor, a great effort has been directed to find selective ligands. Despite intense research efforts in this area, very few compounds with selective 5-HT7 antagonist activity have been reported (Wesolowska, A., Polish J. Pharmacol., 2002, 54: 327-341 , \"In the search for selective ligands of 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 serotonin receptors'), yet even fewer 5-HT7-agonists. \n\n\nSome heterocyclyl-substituted-ethylaminophenyl derivatives showing activity towards 5HT7 receptors were described in our application EP1935886. \n\n\nHowever, there is still a need to find compounds having pharmacological activity towards the receptor 5-HT7, being both effective and selective, and having good \"drugability\" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion. \n\n The authors of the present invention hereby provide some novel heterocyclyl- substituted-alkylaminophenyl derivatives complying with the above mentioned characteristics. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nA first object of the invention refers to compounds of general formula I: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (I) \n\n\nwherein \n\n\nX-Y-Z together form \n\n\n and wherein \n\n\nRi is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical; \n\n\nR\n2\n is selected from the group consisting of a phenyl radical, optionally at least mono-substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH, OH or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched and optionally at least mono- substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH or OH and which may be bonded by an alkylene group; an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or \n\n unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH or OH; or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH or OH n is 1 , 2, 3 or 4; \n\n\nR\n3\n and R\n4\n are independently from each other selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen; a phenyl radical, optionally at least mono- substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH, OH or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH or OH and which may be bonded by an alkylene group; or an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH or OH; or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, CI, Br, I, SH or OH or \n\n\nR\n3\n and R\n4\n form an saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono- substituted 5- or 6-membered-heterocyclic ring, which may be condensed with an optionally at least mono-substituted mono- or polycyclic ring system; \n\n\nR\n5\n is selected from hydrogen, halogen, OH, SH, NH\n2,\n a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or O-R with R being a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical; \n\n\nR\n6\n and R\n7\n each are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or \n\n\nR\n6\n and R\n7\n together with the bridging nitrogen atom form a saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted 5- or 6-membered- heterocyclic ring, which may be condensed with an optionally at least mono- substituted mono- or polycyclic ring system, \n\n optionally in form of one of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, its racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a salt, preferably a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate, respectively. \n\n\nCompounds of general formula I show a high affinity to the 5HT7 receptor as well as a high selectivity for this receptor in comparison to e.g. the 5HT6, the sigma 1 , the sigma 2, and the 5HT1 receptor. In addition some of these compounds show an agonistic activity on this receptor. \n\n\nIn the context of the present invention a \"mono- or polycyclic ring-system\" means a mono- or polycyclic hydrocarbon ring-system that may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic. If the ring system is polycyclic, each of its different rings may show a different degree of saturation, i.e. it may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic. Optionally each of the rings of the mono- or polycyclic ring system may contain one or more heteroatoms as ring members, which may be identical or different and which can preferably be selected from the group consisting of N, O, S and P, more preferably be selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Preferably the polycyclic ring-system may comprise two rings that are condensed. The rings of the mono- or polycyclic ring-system are preferably 5- or 6-membered. \n\n\nAn \"aryl\", \"aryl radical\" or group is understood as meaning ring systems with at least one aromatic ring but without heteroatoms even in only one of the rings. Examples are phenyl, naphthyl, fluoranthenyl, fluorenyl, tetralinyl or indanyl, in particular 9H- fluorenyl or anthracenyl radicals, which can be unsubstituted or monosubstituted or polysubstituted. In the context of this invention \"cycloalkyl radical\" or group is understood as meaning saturated and unsaturated (but not aromatic) cyclic hydrocarbons (without a heteroatom in the ring), which can be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted. Furthermore, C3-4-cycloalkyl represents C3- or C4-cycloalkyl, C3-5-cycloalkyl represents C3-, C4- or C5-cycloalkyl, C3-6-cycloalkyl represents C3-, C4-, C5- or C6-cycloalkyl, C3-7-cycloalkyl represents C3-, C4-, C5-, C6- or C7-cycloalkyl, C3-8- \n\n cycloalkyl represents C3-, C4-, C5-, C6-, 01- or C8-cycloalkyl, C4-5-cycloalkyl represents C4- or C5-cycloalkyl, C4-6-cycloalkyl represents C4-, C5- or C6- cycloalkyl, C4-7-cycloalkyl represents C4-, C5-, C6- or C7-cycloalkyl, C4-8- cycloalkyl represents C4-, C5-, C6- 01- or C8-cycloalkyl C5-6-cycloalkyl represents C5- or C6-cycloalkyl and C5-7-cycloalkyl represents C5-, C6- or C7-cycloalkyl.\n\n\nHowever, mono- or polyunsaturated, preferably monounsaturated, cycloalkyls also in particular fall under the term cycloalkyl as long as the cycloalkyl is not an aromatic system. The cycloalkyl radicals are preferably cyclopropyl, 2-methylcyclopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, and also adamantly. \n\n\nA \"heterocyclyl\", a \"heterocyclyl radical\" or group or \"heterocyclic ring system\" is understood as meaning heterocyclic ring systems which contain one or more heteroatoms from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur in the ring or ringsystem, and can also be mono- or polysubstituted. The ringsystem may consist either of only one saturated or unsaturated or even aromatic ring or may consist of 2, 3 or 4 saturated or unsaturated or even aromatic rings, which are condensed in that between two or more of the rings ring members are shared. Examples which may be mentioned from the group of heterocyclyls are furan, benzofuran, thiophene, benzothiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, quinoline, isoquinoline, phthalazine, benzo-1 ,2,5-thiadiazole, imidazo-thiazole, benzothiazole, indole, benzotriazole, benzodioxolane, benzodioxane, carbazole and quinazoline. In connection with mono- or polycyclic ring-system, aryl radical, cycloalkyl radical, or heterocyclyl radical, \"substituted\" is understood - unless defined otherwise - as meaning replacement of at least one hydrogen radical on the ring-system of the mono- or polycyclic ring-system, the aryl radical, the cycloalkyl radical, or the heterocyclyl radical by OH, SH, =0, halogen (F, CI, Br, I), CN, N0\n2\n, COOH; NRxRy, with Rx and Ry independently being either H or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C1 -6-alkyl; by a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C1 -6-alkyl; a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted -0-C1 -6-alkyl (alkoxy); a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted -S-C1 -6- alkyl; a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted - \n\n C(0)-C1 -6-alkyl; a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted -C(0)-0-C1 -6-alkyl; a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl. Within that \"monosubstituted\" means the substitution of exactly one hydrogen radical, whereas \"polysubstituted\" means the substitution of more than one hydrogen radical with \"polysubstituted\" radicals being understood as meaning that the replacement takes effect both on different and on the same atoms several times with the same or different substituents. Therefore, \"optionally at least monsubstituted\" means either \"not substituted\" if the option is not fulfilled, \"monosubstituted\" or \"polysubstituted\". \n\n\nIn connection with aryl radical, cycloalkyl radical, or heterocyclyl radical, \"condensed with\" is understood as meaning that the ring-system of the aryl radical, the cycloalkyl radical, or the heterocyclyl radical is sharing two atoms (one) of its ring(s) with a ring of the mono- or polycyclic ring-system it is condensed with. \n\n\nAliphatic radicals/groups, as referred to in the present invention, are optionally mono- or polysubstituted and may be branched or linear, saturated or unsaturated. Aliphatic radicals, as defined in the present invention, include alkyl, alkenyl and alkinyl radicals. Unsaturated aliphatic radicals, as defined in the present invention, include alkenyl and alkinyl radicals. Preferred aliphatic radicals according to the present invention include but are not restricted to methyl, ethyl, vinyl (ethenyl), ethinyl, propyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, allyl (2-propenyl), 1 -propinyl, methylethyl, butyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl butenyl, butinyl, 1 -methylpropyl, 2- methylpropyl, 1 ,1 -dimethylethyl, pentyl, n-pentyl, 1 ,1 -dimethylpropyl, 1 ,2- dimethylpropyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, hexyl, 1 -methylpentyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl and n-decyl. \n\n\nIn the context of this invention, \"alkyl\", \"alkyl radical\" or group is understood as meaning saturated, linear or branched hydrocarbons, which can be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted. Thus unsaturated alkyl is understood to encompass alkenyl and alkinyl groups, like e.g. -CH=CH-CH\n3\n or -C≡C-CH\n3\n, while saturated alkyl encompasses e.g. -CH\n3\n and -CH\n2\n-CH\n3\n- In these radicals, C1 -2-alkyl represents C1 - or C2-alkyl, C1 -3-alkyl represents C1 -, C2- or C3-alkyl, C1 -4-alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3- or C4-alkyl, C1 -5-alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3-, C4-, or C5-alkyl, C1 -6- alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3-, C4-, C5- or C6-alkyl, C1 -7-alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3-, C4-, C5-, C6- or C7-alkyl, C1 -8-alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3-, C4-, C5-, C6-, \n\n CI- or C8-alkyl, C1 -10-alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3-, C4-, C5-, C6-, C7-, C8-, C9- or C10-alkyl and C1 -18-alkyl represents C1 -, C2-, C3-, C4-, C5-, C6-, C7-, C8-, C9-, C10-, C1 1 -, C12-, C13-, C14-, C15-, C16-, C17- or C18-alkyl. The alkyl radicals are preferably methyl, ethyl, vinyl (ethenyl), propyl, allyl (2-propenyl), 1 -propinyl, methylethyl, butyl, 1 -methylpropyl, 2-methylpropyl, 1 ,1 -dimethylethyl, pentyl, 1 ,1 - dimethylpropyl, 1 ,2-dimethylpropyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, hexyl, 1 -methylpentyl, if substituted also CHF\n2\n, CF\n3\n or CH\n2\nOH etc. \n\n\nIn connection with alkylene, alkyl or aliphatic radical or group - unless defined otherwise - the term \"substituted\" in the context of this invention is understood as meaning replacement of at least one hydrogen radical by F, CI, Br, I, NH\n2\n, SH or OH; within that \"monosubstituted\" means the substitution of exactly one hydrogen radical, whereas \"polysubstituted\" means the substitution of more than one hydrogen radical with \"polysubstituted'Yadicals being understood as meaning that the replacement takes effect both on different and on the same atoms several times with the same or different substituents, for example three times on the same C atom, as in the case of CF\n3\n, or at different places, as in the case of e.g. -CH(OH)- CH=CH-CHCI\n2\n. Therefore, \"optionally at least monsubstituted\" means either \"not substituted\" if the option is not fulfilled, \"monosubstituted\" or \"polysubstituted\". \n\n\nThe term \"alkylene\" is understood as meaning a divalent alkyl group like -CH\n2\n- or - CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, with (CH\n2\n)3-6 being understood as meaning -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, (CH\n2\n)1 -4 is to be understood as meaning - CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- CH\n2\n-, (CH\n2\n)4-5 is to be understood as meaning -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, etc. An \"alkylene\" may also be unsaturated. \n\n\nThe term \"salt\" is to be understood as meaning any form of the active compound used according to the invention in which it assumes an ionic form or is charged and is coupled with a counter-ion (a cation or anion) or is in solution. By this are also to be understood complexes of the active compound with other molecules and ions, in particular complexes which are complexed via ionic interactions. \n\n\nThe term \"physiologically acceptable salt\" means in the context of this invention any salt that is physiologically tolerated (most of the time meaning not being toxic- \n\n especially not caused by the counter-ion) if used appropriately for a treatment especially if used on or applied to humans and/or mammals. \n\n\nThese physiologically acceptable salts can be formed with cations or bases and in the context of this invention is understood as meaning salts of at least one of the compounds used according to the invention (usually a (deprotonated) acid ) as an anion with at least one, preferably inorganic, cation which is physiologically tolerated especially if used on humans and/or mammals. The salts of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are particularly preferred, and also those with NH\n4\n, but in particular (mono)- or (di)sodium, (mono)- or (di)potassium, magnesium or calcium salts. \n\n\nThese physiologically acceptable salts can also be formed with anions or acids and in the context of this invention is understood as meaning salts of at least one of the compounds used according to the invention (usually protonated, for example on the nitrogen) as the cation with at least one anion which is physiologically tolerated especially if used on humans and/or mammals. By this is understood in particular, in the context of this invention, the salt formed with a physiologically tolerated acid, that is to say salts of the particular active compound with inorganic or organic acids which are physiologically tolerated especially if used on humans and/or mammals. Examples of physiologically tolerated salts of particular acids are salts of: hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid or citric acid. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form or either as free compounds or as solvates and it is intended that those forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates. The term \"solvate\" according to this invention is to be understood as meaning any form of the active compound according to the invention in which this compound has attached to it via non-covalent binding another molecule (most likely a polar solvent) especially including hydrates and alcoholates, e.g. methanolate. \n\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the compounds of the invention are also meant to include \n\n compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by \n13\nC- or \n14\nC-enriched carbon or \n15\nN-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention. \n\n\nAny compound that is a prodrug of a compound of formula (I) is within the scope of the invention. The term \"prodrug\" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides. Examples of well known methods of producing a prodrug of a given acting compound are known to those skilled in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al. \"Textbook of Drug design and Discovery\" Taylor & Francis (April 2002 ). \n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) or their salts or solvates are preferably in pharmaceutically acceptable or substantially pure form. By pharmaceutically acceptable form is meant, inter alia, having a pharmaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. Purity levels for the drug substance are preferably above 50%, more preferably above 70%, most preferably above 90%. In a preferred embodiment it is above 95% of the compound of formula (I) or, or of its salts, solvates or prodrugs. \n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, X-Y-Z of general formula (I) represent - giving rise to general formula (la) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe meanings of R\n1 ;\n R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and n of formula (la) are identical to those defined above for formula (I), although, in a particular and preferred embodiment: \n\n\nRi represents a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical, more specifically an alkyl radical and more preferably a methyl radical, n is preferably 2, \n\n\nR\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n all represent hydrogen atoms, \n\n\nR\n6\n and R\n7\n both represent a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical, more preferably alkyl radicals and more preferably methyl radicals, \n\n\nAnother particular embodiment of the invention arises when X-Y-Z in general formula I is represented by =C-NR\n2\n-N=.

Specifically, three different processes for preparing compounds of formula I are herein described, processes A, B and C. \n\n\nPROCESS A \n\n\n Process A corresponds to a process for preparing compounds of formula I in the particular case that X-Y-Z is -N-N=CRi , that is, a process for preparing compounds of general formula (la) comprising: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (la) a) reacting a compound of general formula (II): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith a compound of general formula (III): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Ullmann reaction between compound (II) and (III) M represents a halogen atom, preferably a bromide and R\n1 ;\n R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and n have the same meaning as in claim 1 or 2. The reaction is carried out in a suitable reaction medium and preferably in the presence of a copper catalyst, a suitable ligand and at least one base. This process can be performed by subjecting the reaction mixture to reflux by conventional heating for a period of time sufficient to achieve the title compound (la), or by microwave radiation. \n\n Suitable reaction media are e.g. organic solvents, such as ethers, preferably diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofurane, dimethyl glycol ether, or alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, or hydrocarbons, preferably benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, or halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chlorobenzene or/and other solvents preferably ethyl acetate, triethylamine, pyridine, dimethulsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile, acetone or nitromethane are included. Mixtures based one or more of the above mentioned solvents and water may also be used. \n\n\nAccording to the invention, the bases that may be used in the process are generally organic or inorganic bases, preferably alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or obtained from other metals such as barium hydroxide or different carbonates, preferably potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate or alkoxydes, e.g. sodium methoxide potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, or organic amines, preferably triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or heterocycles, e.g. 1 ,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1 ,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0]undec-7-ene, pyridine, diamino pydine, dimethylaminopyridine, methylpiperidine or morpholine. Alkali metals such as sodium or its hydrides, e.g. sodium hydride, may also be used. \n\n\nLigand-free conditions are known for Ullmann coupling, but the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable ligand such as mono- or bidentate ligands, such as phosphines, salicylamides, diamines, diols, amino alcohols, amino acids, phosphoramidites, oximephosphine, oxides, or phosphinidenes. \n\n\nThe compounds of general formula (II) are either commercially available or can be produced according to methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\nPreparation of compounds of general formula (III) can be achieved by two consecutive reductive amination reactions of aldehydes of general formula (V) and (VI), \n\n \n\n\n wherein R\n6\n and R\n7\n have the meaning of claim 1 or 2 and m is the total number of carbon atoms contained in R\n6\n or R\n7\n, with a compound of general formula (IV), \n\n\n\n\n\n (IV) wherein M has the meaning described above. The reductive amination is performed by reaction of a mixture comprising a compound of general formula (V) or (VI), and amino compound of general formula (IV) and a reducing agent in a suitable reaction medium, for a period of time sufficient to achieve the title compound (III). The reductive amination reaction can also be performed under microwave radiation preferably for 5 to 60 minutes, and at a temperature between 90 to 120\n5\nC. The use of microwave irradiation limits the formation of undesirable secondary reaction products, compared to what is obtained in a conventional reductive amination procedure. \n\n\nThis process can be performed as a direct reaction when the carbonyl compound of general formula (V) or (VI) and the amine compound of general formula (IV) are mixed with the reducing agent without prior formation of the intermediate imine or iminium salt. A stepwise or indirect reaction involves the reduction of the Preformatted imine in a separate step. \n\n\nIn the case that R\n6\n and R\n7\n have the same meaning, the preparation of compound with general formula (III) can be achieved by direct reductive amination reaction of at least 2 equivalents of the corresponding aldehyde and compound with general formula (IV). \n\n The choice of the reducing agent for reductive amination reaction can be conventionally made by those skilled in the art. Reducing agents useful in this procedure include hydrogen and a catalyst, zinc and HCI, sodium cyanoborohydride, lithium cyanoborohydride, tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride, cyanoborohydride on a solid support, sodium cyanoborohydride and dehydrating agents, sodium cyanoborohydride and titanium additives, sodium cyanoborohydride and zinc halide additives, sodium borohydride, sodium borohydride and dehydrating agents, sodium borohydride and titanium additives, sodium borohydride and zinc salt additives, lithium borohydride, potassium borohydride, polymer-supported borohydride, borohydride exchange resin with nickel acetate or palladium acetate, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride and additives, tetramethylammonium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyano-9- borabicyclo[3.3.1 ]nonane, lithium triethylborohydride, lithium tri(sec- butyl)borohydride, sodium diisopinocampheylcyanoborohydride, amine boranes, borane-pyridine complex and alkylamine boranes. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride is particularly preferred because is non-toxic and generally does not reduce the carbonyl group prior to imine formation. \n\n\nSuitable reaction media are the same as specified before. \n\n\nThe compounds of general formulas (IV), (V), and (VI) are either commercially available or can be produced according to methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\nThe preparation of compounds of general formula (la) is illustrated in scheme 1 : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS B \n\n\n Process B corresponds to the preparation of compounds of formula I in the particular case that X-Y-Z is =C-NR\n2\n-N= and n=2, that is, a process for preparing compounds of general formula (lb) comprising: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(lb) a) the simultaneous reduction of the nitro and double bond moieties of a compound of general formula (VII): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto obtain a compound of general formula VIII): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (VIII) b) optionally, subjecting compound (VIII) to a reductive amination reaction with compounds of general formulas (V) and (VI): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n have the same meaning as in claims 1 or 3, n=2 and m represents the total number of carbon atoms contained in R\n6\n or R\n7\n. \n\n Compounds of general formula (VII) are obtained through a series of consecutive reaction which are illustrated in scheme 2 representing the whole process giving rise to compounds of general formula (lb) with n=2: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (VII) are afforded by a nitroaldol reaction using nitromethane in a suitable reaction medium of aldehydes of general formula (IX), \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n have the meaning given in claim 1 or claim 3. \n\n The synthesis of compounds of general formula (IX) is performed by treatment of compounds of general formula (X) with magnesium, followed by formylation with dimethylformamide, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (X) \n\n\nwherein R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n have the meaning given in claim 1 or 3 and M represents halogen, preferably bromide. \n\n\nFormylation that leads to compounds with general formula (IX) can also be performed from different starting materials as non-halogenated, acid, or acid derivative compounds, and through other methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\nCompounds of general formula (X) are obtained from compounds of general formula \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XI) \n\n\nwherein R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n have the meaning given in claim 1 and 3 and M represents halogen, preferably bromide, through ring closing reaction with hydrazines of general formula (XII), \n\n\n R\n2\n-NH-N H\n2\n \n\n\n (Xll) \n\n\nwherein R\n2\n has the meaning given in claim 1 and 3. \n\n\n1 ,3 Diketones of general formula (XI) are synthesized from lithium enolate intermediates of general formula (XIII), \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n (XIII) \n\n\nwherein R\n4\n and R\n5\n have the meaning given in claim 1 and 3 and M represents halogen, preferably bromide, through reaction in the proper conditions with acid chlorides of general formula (XIV), \n\n\n\n\n\n (XIV) \n\n\nwherein R\n3\n has the meaning given in claim 1 and 3. \n\n\nOrganometallic enolates of general formula (XIII) can be obtained from aryl ketones of general formula (XV), \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XV) \n\n\nwherein R\n4\n and R\n5\n have the meaning given in claim 1 and 3 and M represents halogen, preferably bromide, through treatment with a suitable base, preferably LiHMDS, in a convenient reaction media. \n\n\nIntermediate compounds of general formula (X) can be also achieved by one-pot reaction which includes the above described steps but avoids the isolation of intermediates of general formulas (XIII) and (XI).

The protocol assay was essentially the recommended protocol in the Technical Data Sheet by PerkinEmer Life and Analytical Sciences. The Mass membrane protein/well was typically 12 g and the Receptor/well was about 9-10 fmoles. The Flashplate were let equilibrate at room temperature for one hour before the addition of the components of the assay mixture. The binding buffer was: 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCI2, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA. The radioligand was [\n125\nI]LSD at a final concentration of 0.82 nM. Nonspecific binding was determined with 50 M of Clozapine. The assay volume was 25 I. TopSeal-A were applied onto Flashplate microplates and they were incubated at room temperature for 240 minutes in darkness. The radioactivity were quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux) with a count delay of 4 minutes prior to counting and a counting time of 30 seconds per well. Competition binding data were analyzed by using the LIGAND program ( Munson and Rodbard, LIGAND: A versatile, computerized approach for characterization of ligandbinding systems. Anal. Biochem. 107: 220-239, 1980 ) and assays were performed in triplicate determinations for each point. \n\n\nResults of the radioligand assay for representative compounds/examples are given in the table below: \n\n COMPOUND/ 5-HT\n7\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE Ki \n\n\n (nM)\n\n\n2 597.1\n\n\n3 599±37.4\n\n\n4 576.9181.6\n\n\n8 261.31102.3\n\n\n9 112.712.6\n\n\n10 102116.4\n\n\n11 23.515.2\n\n\n19 447.3164.8\n\n\n22 391.4\n\n\n23 611.4\n\n\n25 419.6\n\n\n28 81.9\n\n\n29 102.1\n\n\n30 299.9\n\n\n31 83.1\n\n\n32 149.7\n\n\n33 527.3\n\n\n34 146.1\n\n\n35 320.3 \n\n\nFORMULATION EXAMPLE \n\n\nExample of a tablet formulation: Compound according to example 28 \n\n Lactose: 60 mg \n\n\nCrystalline cellulose: 25 mg \n\n\nPovidone K 90: 5 mg \n\n\nPregelanitized starch: 3 mg \n\n\nColloidal silica dioxide: 1 mg \n\n\n Magnesium stearate: 1 mg \n\n\nTotal weight per tablet: 100 mg \n\n\nThe above mentioned ingredients were mixed and compressed into a tablet by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art."
