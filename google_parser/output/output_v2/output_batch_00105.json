Description\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/012,329, filed Dec. 7, 2007, which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe immune system is the body's primary defense against diseases caused by pathogens, namely bacteria, viruses, fungi etc, as well as against diseases caused by abnormal growth of the body's own cells and tissues (i.e. cancerous tumors). Normally, the immune system is able to distinguish between the body's normal cells or “self” and foreign pathogens or abnormal cells or “non-self”. The processes by which the immune system refrains from reacting to one's own body is called tolerance. Sometimes, the immune system loses the ability to recognize “self” as normal and the subsequent response directed against the tissue or cells, results in loss of tolerance, a state of autoimmunity. The pathologies resulting from autoimmunity often have serious clinical consequences and are one of the major health problems in the world, especially in developed nations.\n\n\nIL-21 is a potent immunomodulatory four-α-helical bundle type I cytokine that binds to a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-21R and the common gamma chain (reviewed by Spolski and Leonard, \nAnnu Rev Immunol\n. Nov. 8, 2007). IL-21 is produced by NK-T and CD4+ T cells (including pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and follicular helper T\nFH \ncells that are important for germinal center responses) and has pleiotropic effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses, including enhanced proliferation of B and T cells, increased cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells, and regulation of the Th17 cell lineage (see below). IL-21 can also inhibit the antigen-presentation function of dendritic cells and can induce apoptosis in B cells and NK cells under certain conditions. IL-21 has potent anti-tumor activity, but has also been associated with the development of various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis (reviewed by Spolski and Leonard, \nAnnu Rev Immunol. Nov. \n8, 2007).\n\n\nIL-21 has been shown to modulate antibody responses by directly acting on B cells. (Mehta et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n170:4111-4118, 2003; Ozaki et al., \nScience, \n298:1630-1634, 2002; Suto et al., \nBlood, \n100:4565-4573, 2002). IL-21 can induce the differentiation of naïve human B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells (Ozaki et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004; Ettinger et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n175:7867-79, 2005; Ettinger et al, \nJ Immunol. \n178:2872-82, 2007; Kuchen et al. \nJ Immunol. \n179:5886-96, 2007) and to stimulate the production of IgE in human B cell (Kobayashi et al. \nHuman Immunol. doi:\n10:1016/j.humimm.2008.10.) In IL-21 or IL-21R deficient animals, fewer antibody-secreting cells are generated from the germinal center reaction and affinity maturation is reduced (Zotos et al., submitted). Extrafollicular antibody forming cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, require cognate help from a subset of specialized CD4 T cells that secrete IL-21 (Odegard, et al., \nJEM \n205(12):2873-2886, 2008).\n\n\nGeneration of antibodies against allogenic MHC is a pivotal phenomenon in transplant rejection. Transplant recipients who develop titres of anti-MHC antibodies (highly sensitized transplant patients) are t risk for chronic rejection and are poor candidates for new grafts due to likelihood of antibody mediated rejection of the new transplant (Smith, et al., \nAm J Transplantation \n8: 1-11, 2008). In a rat model of acute renal allograft rejection, IL-21 and IL-21R were uniquely increased in intravascular mononuclear cells of renal allografts but not isografts (Hecker, et al., \nImmunobiology\n: doi:10.1016/j.imbio.2008.04.004, (2008)). In human cardiac transplants undergoing rejection, expression levels of IL-21 and IL-21R correlate with the ISHLT rejection grade, and highest expression is present in grades 1R and 2R (Baan, et al., \nTransplantation \n83(11): 1485-1492, 2007).\n\n\nIn graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), the anti-allo response is mediated by uncontrolled activation of T lymphocytes from the graft, which direct an inflammatory response against host tissues. Regulatory T cells (Treg) can modulate this response in animal models. IL-21 has been shown to counteract the regulatory functions of Treg (Clough et al., \nJ Immunol \n180: 5395-5401, 2008). In mouse models of GVHD, transfer of IL-21 deficient T cells resulted in significantly reduced clinical signs and histological scores and increased survival, compared with WT T cells. Decreased frequency of IFN-gamma secreting T cells and increased Tregs were observed in the colon mucosa. IL-21 blockade using anti-mIL-21 mAb and WT T cell transfer produced similar results (Bucher et al., \nBlood \n(ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts) 2008 112: Abstract #2342).\n\n\nIt has also recently been shown that IL-21 is both produced by and required for the differentiation of mouse pro-inflammatory Th17 cells (Korn et al. \nNature. \n448:484-487, 2007; Nurieva et al. \nNature \n448:480-483, 2007; Zhou et al., \nNat Immunol. \n8:967-974, 2007; Wei et al. \nJ Biol Chem. \n282:34605-34610, 2007). Human Th17 cells also produce IL-21 and studies are ongoing to determine whether IL-21 acts as an autocrine factor for human Th17 cells, as it does for mouse Th17 cells. Ozaki et al. (\nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004) demonstrated that IL-21 expression is elevated in lupus-prone BXSB-Yaa mice, a model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), at an age when the early characteristics of autoimmune processes first become evident. Treatment of these BXSB-Yaa mice with a soluble mouse IL-21 receptor (mIL-21R-Fc) partially inhibits various disease parameters, including glomerulonephritis (Bubier et al., \nAnn NY Acad Sci. \n1110:590-601, 2007). Treatment with mIL-21R-Fc has also been shown to be efficacious in another pre-clinical disease model of SLE, the MRL/lpr mouse (Herber et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n178: 3822-3830, 2007), as well as in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of rheumatoid arthritis (Young et al., \nArthr Rheum \n56:1152-1163, 2007). Preliminary human data also suggest dysregulation of IL-21 and IL-21R in SLE (Mitoma et al. \nInt J Mol Med. \n16:609-615, 2005; Wang et al., \nChinese J. Cell. Mol. Immunol. \n23(11):1041-1042, 2007; Sawalha et al. \nAnn Rheum Dis \n67: 458-461, 2008). More recently, Rus et al. data obtained from 24 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls (Nguyen et al., ACR/ARHP Scientific Meeting, 1760/482, 2008 Oct. 24-29 San Francisco, Calif.). Rus et al. showed that 1) IL-21 mRNA expression is significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from lupus patients compared to controls, 2) IL-21 levels are significantly elevated in sera from patients with active compared to inactive SLE or controls, 3) IL-21 enhances CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells proliferation in patients and controls in a dose dependent fashion, 4) IL-21 enhances anti-CD40 induced plasma cell differentiation in normal controls and SLE patients, and 5) elevated levels of IL-21 may contribute to proliferation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and plasma cell differentiation in SLE.\n\n\nMonteleone et al have demonstrated that IL-21 RNA and protein expression is increased in inflamed but not uninflamed tissue from Crohn's disease (CD) (and, to a lesser degree, ulcerative colitis) patients and that IL-21 production by CD3+ cells from lamina propria mononuclear cells from CD patients is also enhanced (Monteleone et al. \nGastroenteroloy \n128:687-694, 2005; Monteleone et al. \nGut \n55:1774-1780, 2006; Peluso et al., \nJ Immunol \n178:732-739, 2007). These authors suggested that IL-21 regulates experimental colitis by modulating the balance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells (Fantini et al. \nEur. J. Immunol. \n37:3155-3163, 2007). Inhibition of IL-21 in vivo with a soluble IL-21 receptor in either mouse or rat models of colitis leads to significant reductions in clinical signs of colitis (Young et al. \nUS \n2006/0039902).\n\n\nThe IL-21 receptor is expressed by NK cells, and NK cells have been shown to be responsive to treatment with IL-21 both in vivo and in vitro. In oncology patients treated with recombinant human IL-21, altered recirculation patterns in lymphocyte subsets including NK cells, and increased expression of markers of NK cell activation and cytolytic effector capacity were observed (Frederiksen, et al., \nCancer Immunol Immunother \n57(10): 1439-1449, 2008). In autoimmune diseases, NK cell activity may play a role in promoting inflammation and associated tissue damage. Tissue homing of NK cells is directed by chemoattractants released at the site of inflammation (Morris and Ley, \nCurr Mol Med.; \n4(4):431-8, 2004). Lamina propria NK cells from patients with Crohn's Disease released greater quantities of IFN-γ and TNF-α when stimulated in vitro with IL-21 and IgG, compared with LPNK cells from controls (Liu and Jiu, \nChronic Inflammation of Liver and Gut, Falk Symposium abst. No. \n163, 2008 Mar. 14-15). NK cells are also reported to regulate autoimmunity and transplant rejection through their interactions with dendritic cells (DC), by killing immature or activated DC, and by releasing cytokines that affect the activation state and antigen presentation functions of the DC (Vivier et al., \nNat Immunol \n9(5):503-510, 2008; Laffont et al., \nBlood \n112:661-671, 2008). A comparison of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from tolerant and non-tolerant liver allograft recipients showed changes in the transcriptional program of NK cells (Martinez-Llordella et al., \nJ Clin Invest \n118(8):2845-2857, 2008). Thus, blockade of IL-21 may modulate the activation status of NK cells, reduce their contribution to tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases, and alter the clinical course of transplant rejection. NK cells are also reported to regulate autoimmunity and transplant rejection through their interactions with dendritic cells (DC), by killing immature or activated DC and by releasing cytokines that affect the activation state and alter antigen presentation functions of the DC. Thus, blockade of IL-21 may modulate the activation of NK cells and reduce their contribution to tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases.\n\n\nThe present invention provides anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies and methods of using those antibodies that inhibit the symptoms and biological activities that manifest as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and are associated with IL-21/IL-21 receptor interactions.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is an alignment of amino acid residues comprising the variable heavy chain regions of antibodies designated by clone numbers 362.78.1.44 (78), 362.597.3 (597), 362.75.1.1 (75), 366.552.11 (552), 366,328.10 (328).\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n is an alignment of amino residues comprising the variable light chain region of the antibodies described above.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n illustrates MALDI/TOF mass spectra of IL-21 peptide sequence regions obtained from IL-21 alone and the IL-21 immune complex.

THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the inventions described herein.\n\n\nThe terms “amino-terminal” and “carboxyl-terminal” are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a polypeptide is located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necessarily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete polypeptide.\n\n\nThe term “antagonist” refers to any compound including a protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, large molecule, or small molecule (less than 10 kD), that decreases the activity, activation or function of another molecule. IL-21 antagonists cause at least one of the following: decreased immune function of NK cells, dendritic cells, T cell subsets and B cell subsets; bind IL-21 such that the interaction of IL-21 protein with its receptor is blocked, inhibited, reduced or neutralized.\n\n\n“Antibodies” (Abs) and “immunoglobulins” (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules that lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas. Thus, as used herein, the term “antibody” or “antibody peptide(s)” refers to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding and includes chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. In certain embodiments, binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. In additional embodiments, binding fragments are produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, and single-chain antibodies, ScFv. “Native antibodies and immunoglobulins” are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide-linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains (Chothia et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n186:651 (1985); Novotny and Haber, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n82:4592 (1985)).\n\n\nThe term “chimeric antibody” or “chimeric antibodies” refers to antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse monoclonal antibody may be joined to human constant segments, such as \ngamma\n 1 and \ngamma\n 3. A typical therapeutic chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein composed of the variable or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the constant domain from a human antibody, although other mammalian species may be used. Specifically, a chimeric antibody is produced by recombinant DNA technology in which all or part of the hinge and constant regions of an immunoglobulin light chain, heavy chain, or both, have been substituted for the corresponding regions from another animal's immunoglobulin light chain or heavy chain. In this way, the antigen-binding portion of the parent monoclonal antibody is grafted onto the backbone of another species' antibody.\n\n\nThe term “epitope” refers to any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. More specifically, the term “IL-21 epitope” as used herein refers to a portion of the IL-21 polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably in a mammal, and most preferably in a mouse or a human. An epitope having immunogenic activity is a portion of a IL-21 polypeptide that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An epitope having antigenic activity is a portion of a IL-21 polypeptide to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic. “Discontinuous epitopes” are conformational epitopes formed from at least two separate regions in the primary sequence of the IL-21 protein. Conformational epitopes lose the ability to specifically bind in the presence of denaturing solvents (e.g. in western blot analyses).\n\n\nThe present invention provides monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind to IL-21 proteins and polypeptides. Human and mouse IL-21 polypeptides, proteins and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides are disclosed in Parrish-Novak et al., \nNature \n408:57-63, 2003; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,307,024 and 6,686,178; and 7,250,274. Described herein are structural and functional characteristics defining regions (epitopes) of the human IL-21 protein that have been identified as targets for a therapeutic monoclonal antibody. Exemplary human anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are presented. Certain of these antibodies have the ability to bind native human IL-21, recombinant wildtype human IL-21, a recombinant mutant IL-21 protein and/or peptide regions of human IL-21.\n\n\nThe present invention provides anti-IL-21 antibodies which are useful in therapeutic treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. For example, anti-IL-21 antibodies are useful in the treatment of psoriasis, pancreatitis, type I diabetes (IDDM), Graves' Disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, autoimmune myocarditis, Kawasaki disease, celiac disease, uveitis, Behcet's disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, inflammatory muscle disease (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), microscopic polyangiitis, autoimmune aplastic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wegener's syndrome, diverticulosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, graft vs. host disease (GVHD), cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), Sjogren's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, autoimmune nephritis, pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hearing loss, neuromyelitis optica, Goodpasture's syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), transplant rejection, highly sensitized transplant patients, anti-phospholipid syndrome, allergy, and asthma, and other autoimmune diseases, or other diseases mediated by IL-21 and IL-21 receptor agonists.\n\n\nFive classes of immunoglobulin, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, have been identified in higher vertebrates. IgG, IgD, and IgE proteins are characteristically disulfide linked heterotetramers consisting of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Typically, IgM is found as a pentamer of a tetramer, whereas IgA occurs as a dimer of a tetramer. Modifications can be introduced in the immunoglobulin moiety.\n\n\nIgG comprises the major class as it normally exists as the second most abundant protein found in plasma. In humans, IgG consists of four subclasses, designated IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Each immunoglobulin heavy chain possesses a constant region that consists of constant region protein domains (CHI, hinge, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and C\nH\n3) that are invariant for a given subclass. The heavy chain constant regions of the IgG class are identified with the Greek symbol γ. For example, immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass contain a γ1 heavy chain constant region.\n\n\nThe Fc fragment, or Fc domain, consists of the disulfide linked heavy chain hinge regions, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains. In immunoglobulin fusion proteins, Fe domains of the IgG1 subclass are often used as the immunoglobulin moiety, because IgG1 has the longest serum half-life of any of the serum proteins. Lengthy serum half-life can be a desirable protein characteristic for animal studies and potential human therapeutic use. In addition, the IgG1 subclass possesses the strongest ability to carry out antibody mediated effector functions. The primary effector function that may be most useful in an immunoglobulin fusion protein is the ability for an IgG1 antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. On the other hand, this could be an undesirable function for a fusion protein that functions primarily as an antagonist. Several of the specific amino acid residues that are important for antibody constant region-mediated activity in the IgG1 subclass have been identified. Inclusion or exclusion of these specific amino acids therefore allows for inclusion or exclusion of specific immunoglobulin constant region-mediated activity (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,260; 5,624,821).\n\n\nModified human IgG1 Fc have been generated for creating Fc fusion proteins. For example, Fc4, Fc5, and Fc6 mutations to reduce effector functions mediated by the Fc by reducing FcγRI binding and complement C1q binding are described in U.S. Patent Application 2006-0034852, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Specifically, three amino acid substitutions were introduced to reduce FcγRI binding. These are the substitutions at EU index positions 234, 235, and 237. Substitutions at these positions have been shown to reduce binding to FcγRI (Duncan et al., \nNature \n332:563 (1988)). These amino acid substitutions may also reduce FcγRIIa binding, as well as FcγRIII binding (Sondermann et al., \nNature \n406:267 (2000); Wines et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n164:5313 (2000)). These mutations do not alter binding to FcRn, which promotes long serum half-life by salvaging IgG through an endocytic recycling pathway.\n\n\nSeveral groups have described the relevance of EU index positions 330 and 331 in complement C1q binding and subsequent complement fixation (Canfield and Morrison, \nJ. Exp. Med. \n173:1483 (1991); Tao et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n178:661 (1993)). Amino acid substitutions at these positions were introduced in Fc4 to reduce complement fixation. The \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of Fc4 is identical to that found in the corresponding wild-type polypeptide, except for the stop codon, which was changed from TGA to TAA to eliminate a potential dam methylation site when the cloned DNA is grown in dam plus strains of \nE. coli\n. In Fc5, the arginine residue at EU index position 218 is a lysine and the remainder of the Fc5 sequence matches the above description for Fc4.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes genetically altered antibodies that are functionally equivalent to the above-described antibodies. Modified antibodies providing improved stability and/or therapeutic efficacy are preferred. Examples of modified antibodies include those with conservative substitutions of amino acid residues, and one or more deletions or additions of amino acids which do not significantly deleteriously alter the antigen binding utility. Substitutions can range from changing or modifying one or more amino acid residues to complete redesign of a region as long as the therapeutic utility is maintained. Antibodies of the present invention can be can be modified post-translationally (e.g., acetylation, and phosphorylation) or can be modified synthetically (e.g., the attachment of a labeling group).\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention may be described or specified in terms of the epitope(s) or portion(s) of an IL-21 polypeptide of the present invention that they recognize or specifically bind. The epitope(s) or polypeptide portion(s) may be specified as described herein, e.g., by N-terminal and C-terminal positions, or by size in contiguous amino acid residues. Antibodies of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their cross-reactivity. Antibodies that do not bind any other analog, ortholog, or homolog of a polypeptide of the present invention are included.\n\n\nEpitope binning refers to the use of competitive binding assays to identify pairs of antibodies that are, or are not, capable of binding IL-21 protein simultaneously thereby identifying antibodies that bind to the same, or overlapping epitopes on protein. Families of antibodies (or bins) having the same or overlapping binding specificity can then be used to help define specific epitopes on IL-21. Epitope binning experiments provide evidence that antigenically distinct epitopes are present. However, by themselves, they do not identify, or “map” the epitope to a specific amino acid sequence or location on the IL-21 protein molecule.\n\n\nCompetition for binding can be evaluated for any pair of antibodies or fragments. For example, using the appropriate detection reagents, the binding specificity of antibodies or binding fragments from any species/source can be compared to the binding specificity of the monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein. Epitope binning can be performed with “isolated antibodies” or with cell culture supernatants. Frequently, binning is performed with first round clonal supernatants to guide the choice of clones to be developed further. The antibodies to be compared should have substantially homogeneous antigen binding domains. In the case of “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibodies the binding specificity of the two different binding sites need to be evaluated or binned independently.\n\n\nThe present invention features ligand-specific antibodies. In addition to competitive binding of antibodies, epitope binning can also be used to identify antibodies to either a receptor or a ligand that competitively interfere with the binding of a ligand to its receptor or the ligand mediated activation of its receptor. Frequently, favorable properties, of a family (or bin) of antibodies can be correlated with a binding to a specific epitope defined by the epitope bin.\n\n\nCompetitive binding experiments do not directly measure the binding affinity, however the antibodies to be tested must bind sufficiently strongly to act as competitors. Generally experimental conditions are designed to minimize the effects of differences in binding affinity.\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 antibodies may also be useful in diagnostic assays for IL-21 protein, e.g., detecting its expression in specific cells, tissues, or serum. Antibodies assigned to different bins and capable of binding to different immunogenic portions, or epitopes, of IL-21 may be used as the reagents for sandwich assays. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is captured by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter detected by a second antibody that also binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention may be assayed for specific binding by any method known in the art. Many different competitive binding assay format(s) can be used for epitope binning. The immunoassays which can be used include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name just a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994\n, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation). Additionally, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed.\n\n\nThe BIACORE® (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) is only one of a variety of surface plasmon resonance assay formats that are routinely used to epitope bin panels of monoclonal antibodies. Many references (e.g. The Epitope Mapping Protocols, \nMethods in Molecular Biology\n, \nVolume\n 66 Glenn E. Morris ed. Humana Press, 1996) describe alternative methods that could be used to bin antibodies and would be expected to provide comparable information regarding the binding specificity of the antibodies to IL-21 protein. When using the BIACORE® system, epitope binning experiments are performed with soluble, native or recombinant antigen. Epitope binning studies can be performed on a BIACORE1000® system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). BIAlogue® v. 1.2 software can be used for programming run methods. For the example of using the BIACORE® to bin mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against IL-21, polyclonal goat anti-Mouse IgG Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) can be covalently immobilized to a BIACORE® CM5 sensor chip and used to bind (capture) the primary monoclonal antibody of test series to the chip. Unoccupied Fc binding sites on the chip are then blocked using a polyclonal IgG Fc fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.). Subsequently, IL-21 protein is injected and allowed to specifically bind to the captured primary monoclonal antibody. The BIACORE® instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip, and the binding of both the primary antibody and IL-21 antigen can be verified for each cycle. Following the binding of the primary antibody and antigen to the chip, soluble secondary antibody is injected and allowed to bind to the pre-bound antigen. If the secondary monoclonal antibody is capable of binding the IL-21 antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, its binding is detected by the BIACORE®. If, however, the secondary monoclonal antibody is not capable of binding the IL-21 antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, no additional binding is detected. Each monoclonal antibody is tested against itself as a negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal.\n\n\nA label-free competitive ELISA format (LFC-ELISA) can also be used to bin antibodies. This method is described by Nagata et al., \nJ. Immuno Methods \n292:141-155, 2004. This method for epitope binning utilized biotinylated IL-21. For the example of binning mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against IL-21, microtiter plates are coated at 100 μL/well with 1 μg/mL of a goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-γ specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in ELISA B (PBS, 0.1\n \n% Tween\n \n 20, 1% BSA). After binding of this coating antibody for 3 hours at ambient temperature, each mAb-containing conditioned media is diluted in ELISA B to yield an approximate mAb concentration of 0.5 μg/mL and allowed to bind to the goat anti-mouse IgG coated plates overnight at 4° C. (mAb#1). In parallel, a second set of conditioned medias (mAb#2) are diluted in polystyrene test tubes to approximately 0.5 μg/mL mAb in ELISA B, mixed with 50 ng/mL biotinylated IL-21 antigen, and incubated overnight at 4° C. After incubation of \nmAb#\n1 with the coating antibody, the plates are blocked with an unrelated antibody to saturate unoccupied binding sites on the plate. The mAb#2-biotin-IL-21 mixtures are added to the plate and allowed to bind. As a control for (non-competition) in the assay, 50 ng/mL biotinylated IL-21 is added directly (without pre-incubation with mAb#2) to wells containing immobilized \nmAb#\n1. After incubation with the biotinylated-IL-21-\nmAb#\n2 complex, streptavidin-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) is added to the plate at 0.5 μg/mL. The plates are developed with TMB substrate (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.), and the absorbance of the individual wells at 450 nm is measured with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX 340, Sunnyvale, Calif.). If \nmAb#\n1 binds to a different epitope from \nmAb#\n2, the biotin-IL-21-\nmAb#\n2 complex will bind to the plate resulting in a high absorbance reading. If \nmAb#\n1 binds to the same epitope as \nmAb#\n2, the biotin-IL-21-\nMAb#\n2 complex will not bind to the plate resulting in a low absorbance reading.\n\n\nLigand-specific antibodies of the present invention can simply bind to or act as antagonists of IL-21. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which do not disrupt IL-21's receptor/ligand interactions or disrupt IL-21's receptor/ligand interactions either partially or fully. The invention features ligand-specific antibodies that prevent receptor activation. The invention includes neutralizing antibodies which bind the ligand and prevent binding of the ligand to the receptor, as well as antibodies which bind the ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation, but do not prevent the ligand from binding the receptor. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, receptor activation can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine or serine/threonine) of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot or luminex based analysis (for example, as described supra). In specific embodiments, antibodies are provided that inhibit ligand or receptor activity by at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50% of the activity in absence of the antibody.\n\n\nProduction of Anti-IL-21 Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies to IL-21 can be generated, for example, using protein that is the product of an IL-21 expression vector or IL-21 isolated from a natural source as an antigen. Anti-IL-21 antibodies of the present invention “bind specifically” to IL-21. Antibodies are considered to be specifically binding if the antibodies exhibit at least one of the following two properties: (1) antibodies bind to IL-21 with a threshold level of binding activity, and (2) antibodies do not significantly cross-react with polypeptides related to IL-21. Related polypeptides could include those of other members of the \nType\n 1 cytokines that bind gamma common chain (γc)-containing receptors, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15.\n\n\nWith regard to the first characteristic, antibodies specifically bind if they bind to a IL-21 polypeptide, peptide or epitope with a binding affinity as reflected in the measured affinity constants. To determine the affinity characteristics, measurements of the kinetic rate constants, equilibrium association constants, and equilibrium dissociation constants were assessed for the interaction of IL-21 antagonists with the IL-21 antigen via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antagonist complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. Equilibrium binding affinity is typically expressed as either a dissociation equilibrium constant (K\nD \n(M)) or an association equilibrium constant (K\nA \n(M\n−1\n)). K\nD \nis obtained by dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n), while K\nA \nis obtained by dividing the association rate constant by the dissociation rate constant (k\na\n/k\nd\n). Antagonists with similar K\nD \n(or a similar K\nA\n) can have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring the k\na \nand k\nd \nas well as the K\nA \nor K\nD \nhelps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antagonist-antigen interaction. The preferred affinity of an antibody is reflected in a K\nA \n(equilibrium association constant) of 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, preferably 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, more preferably 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, and most preferably 10\n9 \nM\n−1 \nor greater. The binding affinity of an antibody can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, by Scatchard analysis (Scatchard, \nAnn. NY Acad. Sci. \n51:660, 1949), or using a commercially available biosensor instrument. With regard to the second characteristic, antibodies do not significantly cross-react with related polypeptide molecules, for example, if they detect IL-21, but not other known polypeptides using a standard Western blot analysis or capture ELISA. Examples of known related polypeptides include known members of the IL-2 family to which IL-21 belongs (for example, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15).\n\n\nMonoclonal anti-IL-21 antibodies can be produced using antigenic IL-21 epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides. Antibodies of the present invention bind antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides containing a sequence of at least nine, or between 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within SEQ ID NO:2 or another amino acid sequence disclosed herein. However, peptides or polypeptides comprising a larger portion of an amino acid sequence containing from 30 to 50 amino acids, or any length up to and including the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide also are useful for inducing antibodies that bind with IL-21. It is desirable that the amino acid sequence of the epitope-bearing peptide is selected to provide substantial solubility in aqueous solvents (i.e., the sequence includes relatively hydrophilic residues, while hydrophobic residues are typically avoided). Moreover, amino acid sequences containing proline residues may be also be desirable for large scale-antibody production.\n\n\nMonoclonal anti-IL-21 antibodies can be generated by methods known to those skilled in the art. Rodent monoclonal antibodies to specific antigens may be obtained by known methods (see, for example, Kohler et al., \nNature \n256:495 (1975), Coligan et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol. 1, pages 2.5.1-2.6.7 (John Wiley & Sons 1991) [“Coligan”], Picksley et al., “Production of monoclonal antibodies against proteins expressed in \nE. coli\n,” in \nDNA Cloning \n2\n: Expression Systems, \n2nd Edition, Glover et al. (eds.), page 93 (Oxford University Press 1995)).\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques. Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention, requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86/05807; PCT Publication WO 89/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.\n\n\nThe expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.\n\n\nA variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., \nE. coli, B. subtilis\n) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., \nSaccharomyces, Pichia\n) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., MPSV, CMV, the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as \nEscherichia coli\n, and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus, CMV enhancer or MPSV promoter is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., 1986\n, Gene \n45:101; Cockett et al., 1990, \nBio/Technology \n8:2).\n\n\nIn bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the \nE. coli \nexpression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 1983, \nEMBO J. \n2:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lacZ coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n13:3101-3109, 1985; Van Heeke & Schuster, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n24:5503-5509, 1989); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.\n\n\nIn an insect system, \nAutographa californica \nnuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).\n\n\nIn mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:355-359, 1984). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., \nMethods in Enzymol. \n153:51-544, 1987).\n\n\nIn addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, WI38, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.\n\n\nFor long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.\n\n\nA number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., \nCell \n11:223, 1977), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n48:202, 1992), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., \nCell \n22:817, 1980) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:357, 1980; O'Hare et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n78:1527, 1981); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n78:2072, 1981); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu and Wu, \nBiotherapy \n3:87-95, 1991; Tolstoshev, \nAnn. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. \n32:573-596, 1993; Mulligan, \nScience \n260:926-932, 1993; and Morgan and Anderson, \nAnn. Rev. Biochem. \n62:191-217, 1993\n; TIB TECH \n11(5):155-215), May, 1993; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., \nGene \n30:147, 1984). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY; and in \n \nChapters\n \n 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n150:1, 1981; which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\nThe expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n3:257, 1983).\n\n\nThe host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, \nNature \n322:52, 1986; Kohler, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:2197, 1980). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.\n\n\nOnce an antibody molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.\n\n\nFor particular uses, it may be desirable to prepare fragments of anti-IL-21 antibodies. Such antibody fragments can be obtained, for example, by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody. Antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. As an illustration, antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F(ab′)2. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent to produce 3.5S Fab′ monovalent fragments. Optionally, the cleavage reaction can be performed using a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups that result from cleavage of disulfide linkages. As an alternative, an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment directly. These methods are described, for example, by Goldenberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647, Nisonoff et al., \nArch Biochem. Biophys. \n89:230, 1960; Porter, \nBiochem. J. \n73:119, 1959; Edelman et al., in Methods in Enzymology Vol. 1, page 422 (Academic Press 1967), and by Coligan at pages 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10.-2.10.4.\n\n\nOther methods of cleaving antibodies, such as separation of heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments, further cleavage of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical or genetic techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.\n\n\nFor example, Fv fragments comprise an association of VH and VL chains. This association can be noncovalent, as described by Inbar et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n69:2659, 1972. Alternatively, the variable chains can be linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond or cross-linked by chemicals such as glutaraldehyde (see, for example, Sandhu, \nCrit. Rev. Biotech. \n12:437, 1992).\n\n\nThe Fv fragments may comprise VH and VL chains which are connected by a peptide linker. These single-chain antigen binding proteins (scFv) are prepared by constructing a structural gene comprising DNA sequences encoding the VH and VL domains which are connected by an oligonucleotide. The structural gene is inserted into an expression vector which is subsequently introduced into a host cell, such as \nE. coli\n. The recombinant host cells synthesize a single polypeptide chain with a linker peptide bridging the two V domains. Methods for producing scFvs are described, for example, by Whitlow et al., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 2:97 (1991) (also see, Bird et al., \nScience \n242:423, 1988, Ladner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778, Pack et al., \nBio/Technology \n11:1271, 1993, and Sandhu, supra).\n\n\nIt is also possible to construct alternative frameworks by using a collection of monomeric proteins to form a monomer domain. These monomer domains can be small enough to penetrate tissues. The monomer domains can be naturally-occurring or non-natural variants or combination thereof. Monomer domains can form multimers of two or more domains. The monomer domain binds a position, analogous to epitopes described herein, on a target molecule. In some cases, the multimer can be formed from a variety of monomer domains. (See, e.g. U.S. Patent Application 2004-0132028 and U.S. Patent Application 2006-0177831.)\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention include derivatives that are modified, i.e, by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding IL-21 or blocking receptor activation. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.\n\n\nAn anti-IL-21 antibody can be conjugated with a detectable label to form an anti-IL-21 immunoconjugate. Suitable detectable labels include, for example, a radioisotope, a fluorescent label, a chemiluminescent label, an enzyme label, a bioluminescent label or colloidal gold. Methods of making and detecting such detectably-labeled immunoconjugates are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are described in more detail below. The detectable label can be a radioisotope that is detected by autoradiography. Isotopes that are particularly useful for the purpose of the present invention are \n3\nH, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n35\nS and \n14\nC.\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 immunoconjugates can also be labeled with a fluorescent compound. The presence of a fluorescently-labeled antibody is determined by exposing the immunoconjugate to light of the proper wavelength and detecting the resultant fluorescence. Fluorescent labeling compounds include fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerytherin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, alexadyes, fluorescent nonparticles (e.g. Q dots) and fluorescamine.\n\n\nIt is also possible that anti-IL-21 immunoconjugates can be detectably labeled by coupling an antibody component to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged immunoconjugate is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of chemiluminescent labeling compounds include luminol, isoluminol, an aromatic acridinium ester, an imidazole, an acridinium salt and an oxalate ester.\n\n\nSimilarly, a bioluminescent compound can be used to label anti-IL-21 immunoconjugates of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Bioluminescent compounds that are useful for labeling include luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.\n\n\nAlternatively, anti-IL-21 immunoconjugates can be detectably labeled by linking an anti-IL-21 antibody component to an enzyme. When the anti-IL-21-enzyme conjugate is incubated in the presence of the appropriate substrate, the enzyme moiety reacts with the substrate to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorometric or visual means. Examples of enzymes that can be used to detectably label polyspecific immunoconjugates include β-galactosidase, glucose oxidase, peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\nThose of skill in the art will know of other suitable labels which can be employed in accordance with the present invention. The binding of marker moieties to anti-IL-21 antibodies can be accomplished using standard techniques known to the art. Typical methodology in this regard is described by the following: Kennedy et al., \nClin. Chim. Acta \n70:1, 1976; Schurs et al., \nClin. Chim. Acta \n81:1, 1977; Shih et al., \nInt'l J. Cancer \n46:1101, 1990; Stein et al., \nCancer Res. \n50:1330, 1990; and Coligan, supra.\n\n\nMoreover, the convenience and versatility of immunochemical detection can be enhanced by using anti-IL-21 antibodies that have been conjugated with avidin, streptavidin, and biotin (see, for example, Wilchek et al. (eds.), “Avidin-Biotin Technology,” Methods In Enzymology, Vol. 184 (Academic Press 1990), and Bayer et al., “Immunochemical Applications of Avidin-Biotin Technology,” in Methods In Molecular Biology, Vol. 10, Manson (ed.), pages 149-162 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992).\n\n\nMethods for performing immunoassays are well-established. See, for example, Cook and Self, “Monoclonal Antibodies in Diagnostic Immunoassays,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Production Engineering and Clinical Application\n, Ritter and Ladyman (eds.), pages 180-208, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), Perry, “The Role of Monoclonal Antibodies in the Advancement of Immunoassay Technology,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications\n, Birch and Lennox (eds.), pages 107-120 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995), and Diamandis, \nImmunoassay \n(Academic Press, Inc. 1996).\n\n\nAntibodies or fragments thereof having increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by modifying (e.g., substituting, deleting or adding) amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 97/34631 and WO 02/060919, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by attaching to said antibodies or antibody fragments polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG). PEG can be attached to said antibodies or antibody fragments with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG, for example, to the N- or C-terminus of said antibodies or antibody fragments or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation will be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by, e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe present invention further includes pharmaceutical compositions, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a polypeptide or antibody described herein. The pharmaceutical composition can include additional therapeutic agents, including but not limited to cytotoxic agents a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine). For example, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, α-IFN, β-IFN, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), antibodies designed to antagonize biological response modifiers, other antibodies, other Fc fusion proteins or other growth factors.\n\n\nFor purposes of therapy, anti-IL-21 antibody molecules and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount. A combination of a therapeutic molecule of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is said to be administered in a “therapeutically effective amount” if the amount administered is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient patient. For example, an agent used to treat inflammation is physiologically significant if its presence alleviates the inflammatory response.\n\n\nDegradable polymer microspheres have been designed to maintain high systemic levels of therapeutic proteins. Microspheres are prepared from degradable polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly (ortho esters), nonbiodegradable ethylvinyl acetate polymers, in which proteins are entrapped in the polymer (Gombotz and Pettit, \nBioconjugate Chem. \n6:332, 1995; Ranade, “Role of Polymers in Drug Delivery,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems\n, Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 51-93 (CRC Press 1995); Roskos and Maskiewicz, “Degradable Controlled Release Systems Useful for Protein Delivery,” in \nProtein Delivery\n: Physical Systems, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 45-92 (Plenum Press 1997); Bartus et al., \nScience \n281:1161, 1998; Putney and Burke, \nNature Biotechnology \n16:153, 1998; Putney, \nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol. \n2:548, 1998). Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated nanospheres can also provide carriers for intravenous administration of therapeutic proteins (see, for example, Gref et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:167, 1997).\n\n\nOther dosage forms can be devised by those skilled in the art, as shown, for example, by Ansel and Popovich, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, \n5th Edition (Lea & Febiger 1990), Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company 1995), and by Ranade and Hollinger, \nDrug Delivery Systems \n(CRC Press 1996).\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions may be supplied as a kit comprising a container that comprises a neutralizing anti-IL-21 antibody. Therapeutic polypeptides can be provided in the form of an injectable solution for single or multiple doses, or as a sterile powder that will be reconstituted before injection. Alternatively, such a kit can include a dry-powder disperser, liquid aerosol generator, or nebulizer for administration of a therapeutic polypeptide. Such a kit may further comprise written information on indications and usage of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising anti-IL-21 antibodies can be furnished in liquid form, in an aerosol, or in solid form. Liquid forms, are illustrated by injectable solutions, aerosols, droplets, topological solutions and oral suspensions. Exemplary solid forms include capsules, tablets, and controlled-release forms. The latter form is illustrated by miniosmotic pumps and implants (Bremer et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:239, 1997; Ranade, “Implants in Drug Delivery,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems\n, Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 95-123 (CRC Press 1995); Bremer et al., “Protein Delivery with Infusion Pumps,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 239-254 (Plenum Press 1997); Yewey et al., “Delivery of Proteins from a Controlled Release Injectable Implant,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 93-117 (Plenum Press 1997)). Other solid forms include creams, pastes, other topological applications, and the like.\n\n\nTherapeutic Uses for Anti-IL-21 Antibodies\n\n\nIL-21 is a CD4+ T cell-derived cytokine that is important for optimal CD8+ T cell mediated immunity, NK cell activation, and optimal humoral responses, such as antibody production and B cell maturation. IL-21 has been shown to induce a number of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as IL-18, IL-15, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7A, IL-17F, TNFRII, sCD25, and RANTES. IL-21 also induces an acute phase response in non-human primates and humans when administered by IV or SC injection (Dodds et al., \nCancer Immunol Immunother \n2008 Oct. 17 [electronic publication]). In vitro, stimulates the growth of certain neoplastic immune cell populations such as multiple myeloma cells and acute T-cell leukemia (Brenne et al \nBlood \n99(10):3756-62 (2002), diCarlo E, et al \nCancer Immunol Immunother \n56(9):1323-1324 (2007)). IL-21 is also produced by Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Lamprecht et al., \nBlood \n112(8):3339-47, 2008). Increased expression of IL-21 receptor has been shown in epidermis in patients with systemic sclerosis (Distler et al., \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatism \n52:865-864, 2004) and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (Jungel et al., \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatism \n50:1468-1476, 2004). Moreover, autoimmune, diabetic NOD mice have increased IL-21 receptor expression (King et al., \nCell \n117:265-277, 2004.) It has been shown that IgG and IL-21 expression is increased in the BXSB-Yaa mouse model which develop an autoimmune lupus erythematosus-like disease (Ozaki et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361-5371, 2004); IL-21 expression is higher in lupus-prone sanroque mice (Vinuesa et al. \nNature \n435:452, 2005); IL-21 expression is higher in inflamed vs uninflamed gut tissues from patients with Crohn's disease (Monteleone, et al., \nGastroenterology \n128:687-694, 2005). IL-21 is also overproduced in the mucosa of celiac disease patients (Finn et al. \nGut, PMID: \n17965065, 2007).\n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount of an anti-IL-21 antibody refers to an amount of antibody which when administered to a subject is effective to prevent, delay, reduce or inhibit a symptom or biological activity associated with a disease or disorder. Administration may consist of a single dose or multiple doses and may be given in combination with other pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\nThe present invention provides compositions and methods for using anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies in inflammatory and immune diseases or conditions such as psoriasis, pancreatitis, type I diabetes (IDDM), Graves' Disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, autoimmune myocarditis, Kawasaki disease, celiac disease, uveitis, Behcet's disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, inflammatory muscle disease (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), microscopic polyangiitis, autoimmune aplastic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wegener's syndrome, diverticulosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, graft vs. host disease (GVHD), cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), Sjogren's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, autoimmune nephritis, pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hearing loss, neuromyelitis optica, Goodpasture's syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), transplant rejection, highly sensitized transplant patients, anti-phospholipid syndrome, allergy, and asthma, and other autoimmune diseases. The present invention provides compositions and methods for using anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies in the therapy for certain immune cell cancers such as multiple myeloma, acute T-cell leukemia, or Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\n\n\nContact Dermatitis\n\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis is defined as a T cell mediated immune reaction to an antigen that comes into contact with the skin. The CLA+ T cell population is believed to be involved in the initiation of dermatitis since allergen dependent T cell responses are largely confined to the CLA+ population of cells (See Santamaria-Babi, et al., \nJ Exp Med \n181:1935, (1995)). Recent data have found that only memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ CLA+ and not CD8+ T cells proliferate and produce both type-1 (IFN-γ) and type-2 (IL-5) cytokines in response to nickel, a common contact hypersensitivity allergen. Furthermore, cells expressing CLA in combination with CD4, CD45RO (memory) or CD69 are increased after nickel-specific stimulation and express the chemokine receptors CXCR3, CCR4, CCR10 but not CCR6. See Moed et al., \nBr J Dermatol \n51:32, (2004).\n\n\nIn animal models, it has been demonstrated that allergic contact dermatitis is T cell-dependent and that the allergic-responsive T cells migrate to the site of allergen application. See generally: Engeman, et al., \nJ Immunol \n164:5207, (2000); Ferguson & Kupper, \nJ Immunol \n150:1172, (1993); and Gorbachev & Fairchild, \nCrit Rev Immunol. \n21:451 (2001).\n\n\nAdministration anti-IL-21 antibodies to mousse models of contact hypersensitivity is used to evaluate the clinical utility of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease.\n\n\nAtopic Dermatitis\n\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease with a dramatically increasing incidence over the last decades. Clinically AD is characterized by highly pruritic, often excoriated, plaques and papules that show a chronic relapsing course. The diagnosis of AD is mostly based on major and minor clinical findings. See Hanifin J. M., \nArch Dermatol \n135:1551 (1999). Histopathology reveals spongiosis, hyperparakeratosis and focal parakeratosis in acute lesions, whereas marked epidermal hyperplasia with hyperparakeratosis and parakeratosis, acanthosis/hypergranulosis and perivascular infiltration of the dermis with lymphocytes and abundant mast cells are the hallmarks of chronic lesions.\n\n\nT cells play a central role in the initiation of local immune responses in tissues and evidence suggests that skin-infiltrating T cells in particular, may play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disregulated immune responses in the skin. Approximately 90% of infiltrating T cells in cutaneous inflammatory sites express the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen which binds E-selectin, an inducible adhesion molecule on endothelium (reviewed in Santamaria-Babi, et al., \nEur J Dermatol \n14:13, (2004)). A significant increase in circulating CLA+ T cells among AD patients compared with control individuals has been documented (See Teraki, et al., \nBr J Dermatol \n143:373 (2000), while others have demonstrated that memory CLA+ T cells from AD patients preferentially respond to allergen extract compared to the CLA− population (See Santamaria-Babi, L. F., et al., \nJ Exp Med. \n181:1935, (1995)). In humans, the pathogenesis of atopic disorders of the skin have been associated with increases in CLA+ T cells that express increased levels of Th-2-type cytokines like IL-5 and IL-13. See Akdis et al., \nEur J Immunol \n30:3533 (2000); and Hamid et al., \nJ Allergy Clin Immunol \n98: 225 (1996).\n\n\nNC/Nga mice spontaneously develop AD-like lesions that parallel human AD in many aspects, including clinical course and signs, histopathology and immunopathology when housed in non-specified pathogen-free (non-SPF) conditions at around 6-8 weeks of age. In contrast, NC/Nga mice kept under SPF conditions do not develop skin lesions. However, onset of spontaneous skin lesions and scratching behaviour can be synchronized in NC/Nga mice housed in a SPF facility by weekly intradermal injection of crude dust mite antigen. See Matsuoka et al., \nAllergy \n58:139 (2003). Therefore, the development of AD in NC/Nga is a useful model for the evaluation of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD.\n\n\nIn addition to the NC/Nga model of spontaneous AD, epicutaneous sensitization of mice using OVA can also be used as a model to induce antigen-dependent epidermal and dermal thickening with a mononuclear infiltrate in skin of sensitized mice. This usually coincides with elevated serum levels of total and specific IgE, however no skin barrier dysfunction or pruritus normally occurs in this model. See Spergel et al., \nJ Clin Invest, \n101: 1614, (1998). This protocol can be modified in order to induce skin barrier disregulation and pruritis by sensitizing DO11.10 OVA TCR transgenic mice with OVA. Increasing the number of antigen-specific T cells that could recognize the sensitizing antigen may increase the level of inflammation in the skin to induce visible scratching behaviour and lichenification/scaling of the skin.\n\n\nAdministration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to mouse models of atopic dermatitis is used to evaluate the clinical utility of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease.\n\n\nArthritis\n\n\nArthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic joints as a result of injury, and the like, are common inflammatory conditions which would benefit from the therapeutic use of anti-inflammatory antibodies and binding polypeptides. For example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease that affects the entire body and is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is characterized by the inflammation of the membrane lining the joint, which causes pain, stiffness, warmth, redness and swelling. Inflammatory cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage. As a result of rheumatoid arthritis, the inflamed joint lining, the synovium, can invade and damage bone and cartilage leading to joint deterioration and severe pain amongst other physiologic effects. The involved joint can lose its shape and alignment, resulting in pain and loss of movement.\n\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease particularly characterized by inflammation and subsequent tissue damage leading to severe disability and increased mortality. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA has led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis (Gabay, \nExpert. Opin. Biol. Ther. \n2(2):135-149, 2002).\n\n\nThere are several animal models for rheumatoid arthritis known in the art. For example, in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, mice develop chronic inflammatory arthritis that closely resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. Since CIA shares similar immunological and pathological features with RA, this makes it an ideal model for screening potential human anti-inflammatory compounds. The CIA model is a well-known model in mice that depends on both an immune response, and an inflammatory response, in order to occur. The immune response comprises the interaction of B-cells and CD4+ T-cells in response to collagen, which is administered as antigen, and leads to the production of anti-collagen antibodies. The inflammatory phase is the result of tissue responses from mediators of inflammation, as a consequence of some of these antibodies cross-reacting to the mouse's native collagen and activating the complement cascade. An advantage in using the CIA model is that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis are known. The relevant T-cell and B-cell epitopes on type II collagen have been identified, and various immunological (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity and anti-collagen antibody) and inflammatory (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes) parameters relating to immune-mediated arthritis have been determined, and can thus be used to assess test compound efficacy in the CIA model (Wooley, \nCurr. Opin. Rheum. \n3:407-20, 1999; Williams et al., \nImmunol. \n89:9784-788, 1992; Myers et al., \nLife Sci. \n61:1861-78, 1997; and Wang et al., \nImmunol. \n92:8955-959, 1995).\n\n\nThe administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to these CIA model mice is used to evaluate the use of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease.\n\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\n\n\nIn the United States approximately 500,000 people suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which can affect either colon and rectum (ulcerative colitis) or both, small and large intestine (Crohn's Disease). The pathogenesis of these diseases is unclear, but they involve chronic inflammation of the affected tissues. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine, commonly called the colon, characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa or innermost lining of the colon. This inflammation causes the colon to empty frequently, resulting in diarrhea. Symptoms include loosening of the stool and associated abdominal cramping, fever and weight loss. Although the exact cause of UC is unknown, recent research suggests that the body's natural defenses are operating against proteins in the body which the immune systems thinks are “non-self” (an “autoimmune reaction”). Perhaps because they resemble bacterial proteins in the gut, these proteins may either instigate or stimulate the inflammatory process that begins to destroy the lining of the colon. As the lining of the colon is destroyed, ulcers form releasing mucus, pus and blood. The disease usually begins in the rectal area and may eventually extend through the entire large bowel. Repeated episodes of inflammation lead to thickening of the wall of the intestine and rectum with scar tissue. Death of colon tissue or sepsis may occur with severe disease. The symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary in severity and their onset may be gradual or sudden. Attacks may be provoked by many factors, including respiratory infections or stress.\n\n\nAlthough there is currently no cure for UC available, treatments are focused on suppressing the abnormal inflammatory process in the colon lining. Treatments including corticosteroids immunosuppressives (eg. azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) and aminosalicytates are available to treat the disease. However, the long-term use of immunosuppressives such as corticosteroids and azathioprine can result in serious side effects including bone-thinning, cataracts, infection, and liver and bone marrow effects. In the patients in whom current therapies are not successful, surgery is an option. However, the surgery involves the removal of the entire colon and the rectum.\n\n\nThere are several animal models that can partially mimic chronic ulcerative colitis. The most widely used model is the 2,4,6-trinitrobenesulfonic acid/ethanol (TNBS) induced colitis model, which induces chronic inflammation and ulceration in the colon. When TNBS is introduced into the colon of susceptible mice via intra-rectal instillation, it induces T-cell mediated immune response in the colonic mucosa, in this case leading to a massive mucosal inflammation characterized by the dense infiltration of T-cells and macrophages throughout the entire wall of the large bowel. Moreover, this histopathologic picture is accompanied by the clinical picture of progressive weight loss (wasting), bloody diarrhea, rectal prolapse, and large bowel wall thickening (Neurath et al. \nIntern. Rev. Immunol. \n19:51-62, 2000). Adoptive transfer of naive T cells into minor histocompatibility mismatched or syngeneic immunocompromised mice leads to development of colitis (Leach M W et al 1996, Powrie F et al, 1997) as well as skin lesions resembling psoriasis (Schon M P et al., \nNat Med. \n2:183-8, 1997; Davenport C M et al., \nInt Immunopharmacol. \n5:653-72, 2002). Transplantation of as few as 0.2 million CD4+CD25− T cells from BALB/C or B10.D2 mice into immunocompromised C.B-17 SCID mice results in weight loss, hemoccult positive stool and development of skin lesions. The symptoms in these mice vary from colony to colony. This model of colitis/psoriasis has some similarities to human Crohn's disease and psoriasis, and has been used extensively to test efficacy of therapeutics for these diseases in humans.\n\n\nAnother colitis model uses dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), which induces an acute colitis manifested by bloody diarrhea, weight loss, shortening of the colon and mucosal ulceration with neutrophil infiltration. DSS-induced colitis is characterized histologically by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria, with lymphoid hyperplasia, focal crypt damage, and epithelial ulceration. These changes are thought to develop due to a toxic effect of DSS on the epithelium and by phagocytosis of lamina propria cells and production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Despite its common use, several issues regarding the mechanisms of DSS-induced disease and its relevance to the human disease remain unresolved. DSS is regarded as a T cell-independent model because it is observed in T cell-deficient animals such as SCID mice.\n\n\nThe administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to these TNBS, DSS or CD4+ T cell-transfer models can be used to evaluate the use of IL-21 antagonists to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of gastrointestinal disease. IL-21 may play a role in the inflammatory response in colitis, and the neutralization of IL-21 activity by administrating IL-21 antagonists is a potential therapeutic approach for IBD.\n\n\nPsoriasis\n\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin condition that affects more than seven million Americans. Psoriasis occurs when new skin cells grow abnormally, resulting in inflamed, swollen, and scaly patches of skin where terminal differentiation of keratinocytes is altered. Plaque psoriasis, the most common form, is characterized by inflamed patches of skin (“lesions”) topped with silvery white scales. Psoriasis may be limited to a few plaques or involve moderate to extensive areas of skin, appearing most commonly on the scalp, knees, elbows and trunk. Although it is highly visible, psoriasis is not a contagious disease. The pathogenesis of the diseases involves T cell activation, altered antigen presentation and cytokine production by inflammatory dendritic cells, and chronic inflammation of the affected tissues. Anti-IL-21 antibodies of the present invention, could serve as a valuable therapeutic to reduce inflammation and pathological effects in psoriasis, other inflammatory skin diseases, skin and mucosal allergies, and related diseases.\n\n\nPsoriasis is a T-cell mediated inflammatory disorder of the skin that can cause considerable discomfort. It is a disease for which there is no cure and affects people of all ages. Psoriasis affects approximately two percent of the populations of European and North America. Although individuals with mild psoriasis can often control their disease with topical agents, more than one million patients worldwide require ultraviolet light treatments or systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Unfortunately, the inconvenience and risks of ultraviolet radiation and the toxicities of many therapies limit their long-term use. Moreover, patients usually have recurrence of psoriasis, and in some cases rebound, shortly after stopping immunosuppressive therapy. Anti-IL-21 antibodies can be tested using a recently developed a model of psoriasis based on the CD4+CD45RB transfer model (Davenport et al., \nInternat. Immunopharmacol., \n2:653-672, 2002).\n\n\nIn addition to other disease models described herein, the activity of anti-IL-21 antibodies on inflammatory tissue derived from human psoriatic lesions can be measured in vivo using a severe combined immune deficient (SCID) based mouse model. Several mouse models have been developed in which human cells or tissue grafts are implanted into immunodeficient mice (collectively referred to as xenograft models); see, for example, Cattan and Douglas, \nLeuk. Res. \n18:513-22, 1994 and Flavell, \nHematological Oncology \n14:67-82, 1996. As an in vivo xenograft model for psoriasis, human psoriatic skin tissue is grafted onto SCID mice, and the mice are subsequently challenged with an appropriate antagonist. Moreover, other psoriasis animal models in the art may be used to evaluate IL-21 antagonists, such as human psoriatic skin grafts implanted into the AGR129 mouse model, and challenged with an appropriate antagonist (e.g., see, Boyman et al., \nJ. Exp. Med\n. Online publication #20031482, 2004). Similarly, tissues or cells derived from human colitis, IBD, arthritis, or other inflammatory lesions can be used in the SCID model to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of the anti-IL-21 antibodies described herein.\n\n\nEfficacy of treatment is measured and statistically evaluated as increased anti-inflammatory effect within the treated population over time using methods well known in the art. Some exemplary methods include, but are not limited to measuring for example, in a psoriasis model, epidermal thickness, the number of inflammatory cells in the upper dermis, and the grades of parakeratosis. Such methods are known in the art and described herein. For example, see Zeigler et al., \nLab Invest \n81:1253, 2001; Zollner et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n109:671, 2002; Yamanaka et al., \nMicrobiol. Immunol. \n45:507, 2001; Raychaudhuri et al., \nBr. J. Dermatol. \n144:931, 2001; Boehncke et al., \nArch. Dermatol. Res. \n291:104, 1999; Boehncke et al., \nJ. Invest. Dermatol. \n116:596, 2001; Nickoloff et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n146:580, 1995; Boehncke et al., \nJ. Cutan. Pathol. \n24:1, 1997; Sugai et al., \nJ. Dermatol. Sci. \n17:85, 1998; and Villadsen et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n112:1571, 2003. Inflammation may also be monitored over time using well-known methods such as flow cytometry (or PCR) to quantitate the number of inflammatory or lesional cells present in a sample, score (weight loss, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon length) for IBD, paw disease score and inflammation score for CIA RA model.\n\n\nThe administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to these psoriasis model mice is used to evaluate the use of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease.\n\n\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\n\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune-complex related disorder characterized by chronic IgG antibody production directed at ubiquitous self antigens (e.g. anti-dsDNA). The effects of SLE are systemic, rather than localized to a specific organ, although glomerulonephritis may result in some cases (i.e. lupus nephritis). Multiple chromosomal loci have been associated with the disease and may contribute towards different aspects of the disease, such as anti-dsDNA antibodies and glomerulonephritis. CD4+ T cells have been shown to play an active part in mouse models of SLE (Horwitz, \nLupus \n10:319-320, 2001; Yellin and Thienel, \nCurr. Rheumatol. Rep., \n2:24-37, 2000). The role for CD8+ T cells is not clearly defined, but there is evidence to suggest that “suppressor” CD8+ T cell function is impaired in lupus patients (Filaci et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n166:6452-6457, 2001; Sakane et al, \nJ. Immunol., \n137:3809-3813, 1986).\n\n\nIL-21 has been convincingly shown to induce the differentiation of naïve human B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells (Ozaki et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004; Ettinger et al., \nJ Immunol. \n175:7867-79, 2005; Ettinger et al, \nJ. Immunol. \n178:2872-82, 2007; Kuchen et al. \nJ Immunol. \n179:5886-96, 2007). Ozaki et al., (\nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004) also demonstrated that IL-21 expression is elevated in lupus-prone BXSB-Yaa mice, a model for SLE, at an age when the early characteristics of autoimmune processes first become evident. Treatment of these BXSB-Yaa mice with a murine IL-21 antagonist partially inhibits various disease parameters, including glomerulonephritis (Bubier et al., \nAnn NY Acad Sci. \n1110:590-601, 2007). The same IL-21 antagonist has also been shown to be efficacious in another pre-clinical disease model of SLE, the MRL/lpr mouse (Herber et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n178: 3822-3830, 2007). Moreover, because IL-21 limits development of Treg cells, administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies could provide a more robust T cell suppressor function in lupus patients where that function is compromised (Lamprecht et al. \nBlood. \n112(8):3339-47, 2008).\n\n\nData obtained from 24 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls showed that 1) IL-21 mRNA expression is significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from lupus patients compared to controls, 2) IL-21 levels are significantly elevated in sera from patients with active compared to inactive SLE or controls, as determined using a commercial IL-21 ELISA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 3) IL-21 enhances CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells proliferation in patients and controls in a dose dependent fashion, 4) IL-21 enhances anti-CD40 induced plasma cell differentiation in normal controls and SLE patients, and 5) elevated levels of IL-21 may contribute to proliferation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and plasma cell differentiation in SLE ((Rus, V., \nACR Presentation #\n1760, 2008 American College of Rheumatology meeting, Oct. 24-29, 2008).\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 antibodies can be administered in combination with other agents already in use in autoimmunity including immune modulators such as IFNγ, NOVANTRONE®, ENBREL®, BETAFERON®, REMICADE®, LEUKINE® and PROLEUKIN®. Anti-IL-21 antibodies can be administered in combination with other agents already in use in the cancer therapy of multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's Lymphoma or acute T-cell leukemia such as THALOMID® or with steroids such as dexamethasone or prednisone. Establishing the optimal dose level and scheduling for anti-IL-21 antibodies is done by a variety of means, including study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-IL-21 antibodies; determination of effective doses in animal models, and evaluation of the toxicity of anti-IL-21 antibodies. Direct pharmacokinetic measurements done in primates and clinical trials can then be used to predict theoretical doses in patients that achieve plasma anti-IL-21 antibody levels that are of sufficient magnitude and duration to achieve a biological response in patients.\n\n\nTransplant Rejection\n\n\nRecipients of transplanted solid organs may develop acute or chronic rejection of the allograft due to histocompatability mismatch. The generation of antibodies directed against the HLA molecules (alloantibodies) in these patients results from presentation of the foreign antigen to T cells. Alloantibodies may mediate tissue damage in the graft through formation of immune complexes, complement fixation, and antibody mediated cellular cytotoxicity directed by bound alloantibodies. The complement cascade also releases local factors that activate endothelial cells and cause vasculopathy within the graft. The complement product C4d is an early marker in both acute and chronic transplant rejection, and can be detected in sub-clinical cases prior to overt pathological changes (Racusen and Haas, \nClin J Am Soc Nephrol \n1: 415-420, 2006; Moll and Pascual, \nAm J Transplantation \n5: 2611-2618, 2005; Tinkam and Chandraker, \nClin J Am Soc Nephrol \n1: 404-414, 2006). Patients are screened for anti-HLA alloantibodies (panel reactive antibody) prior to transplantation. Patients may be highly sensitized due to prior allograft failure, blood transfusions, or multiple pregnancies. The presence of alloantibodies in highly sensitized transplant patients complicates their care, as increased immunosuppressive therapies may be required and the chance of acute rejection is high (Baid et al., \nCurr Opin Immunol \n13:577-581, 2001). In some cases, B cell targeting agents (mycophenolic acid or rituximab) are used, although this therapeutic strategy does not directly target the antibody-secreting plasma cells. Plasmapheresis is also used to reduce circulating immunoglobulin. In all cases, transplant recipients are treated with T cell targeted immunosuppressive agents to reduce the risk of rejection, and may be slowly “weaned” from these regimens as tolerance to the graft is established (Seyfort-Margolis and Turka, \nJ Clin Invest \n118(8): 2684-2685, 2008; Taylor et al., \nCrit Rev Oncol Hematol \n56:23-46, 2005; Amante and Ejercito, \nTransplant Proc \n40: 2274-2280, 2008).\n\n\nDevelopment of antibody secreting plasma cells requires cognate help from CD4 T cells in addition to the specialized microenvironments that support plasma cell survival (Tarlington et al., \nCurr Opin Immunol \n20:162-169, 2008). Cytokine secretion by activated T cells is necessary for differentiation and survival of plasma cells, and is known to affect the nature of the antibody response and Ig isotype. Models exist to monitor T cell dependent antibody responses in murine and non-human primate species. These methods are well understood by those skilled in the art. Kinetics and magnitude of primary or secondary antibody responses against model peptide antigens such as ovalbumin, tetanus toxoid, sheep red blood cells, or trinitrophenyl modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin are monitored using assays that detect total or antigen-specific antibodies, including IgG sub-types, IgM, IgE, or IgA in serum of treated animals. In some models, affinity maturation of the antibodies can also be monitored. These models may be used to test the effects of therapeutic drugs that alter B cell help by T cells and that block cytokines thought to be important for plasma cell differentiation and survival.\n\n\nStudies of allograft rejection are conducted in many animal species. For example, a renal transplant model in cynomolgus monkeys may represent the effects of chronic alloantibody mediated renal allograft rejection in humans. Allograft tolerizing regimens are performed prior to transplant in some cases. The presence of donor-specific alloantibodies is monitored by flow cytometric analysis of recipient serum with mismatched peripheral blood leukocytes, and deposition of the complement product C4d is detected in biopsies from the renal allograft (Smith et al., \nAm J Transplant \n6:1790-1798, 2006; Smith et al., \nAm J Transplant \n8:1-11, 2008). Acute and chronic transplant models may be conducted in murine species by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAdministration of anti-IL-21 antibodies in a model of T cell dependent antibody response or a model of allograft rejection is used to evaluate the clinical utility of anti-IL-21 antibodies to reduce alloantibody responses, and ameliorate symptoms of allograft rejection, or as part of the pre-transplant therapeutic or tolerizing regimen for transplant recipients, including highly sensitized transplant patients.\n\n\nThe invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of IL-21 Proteins and Antibodies\n\n\nA. Immunizations and Hybridomas\n\n\nIL-21 protein was produced as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,250,274, incorporated in its entirety herein. Soluble IL-21 receptor proteins were produced as described in U.S. Patent Application 2007-0122413 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,539, both incorporated in their entirety herein. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were produced in wild type mice generating murine antibodies and in transgenic mice generating fully human antibodies (Medarex, Princeton, N.J.). Mice were immunized with human IL-21 protein. Briefly, the mice were initially immunized by subcutaneous injection with 30 μg of purified recombinant IL-21 (produced in \nE. coli \nat ZymoGenetics) conjugated with BSA (Imject Pharmalink Immunogen Kit, Pierce) and administered in combination with CpG (oligonucleotide murine TLR9 ligand and GM-CSF (Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulatory Factor, R&D, Minneapolis, Minn.) and Emulsigen®-P adjuvant (MVP Laboratories, INC, Omaha, Nebr.) as per manufacturer's instructions. Following the initial immunization, each of the mice received three additional 30 μg of IL-21 in Emulsigen®-P adjuvant via the subcutaneous route in weekly intervals. Seven days after the fourth immunization, the mice were bled via the retro orbital plexus and the serum separated from the blood for analysis of its ability to bind to IL-21.\n\n\nSplenocytes were harvested and pooled from two high-titer BALB/c mice or transgenic mice and fused to P3-X63-Ag8.653 mouse myeloma cells using PEG 1450 in a single fusion procedure (2:1 fusion ratio, splenocytes to myeloma cells, “Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual”, E. Harlow and D. Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Press). Following 9 days growth post-fusion, specific antibody-producing hybridoma pools were identified by Direct and Capture ELISA using recombinant IL-21 protein, untagged and human IgG Fc tagged, as specific antibody target. Positive hybridoma pools were analyzed further for their ability to block the Ligand to receptor binding, which is measured as the level of STAT3-phosphorylation following ligand-receptor interaction (“phosphor-STAT3 neutralization assay”) of purified recombinant IL-21 protein on BaF3 cells expressing the IL-21 receptor sequence. Monoclonal antibodies purified from tissue culture media were characterized for their ability to block the ligand-receptor interaction (“phosphor-STAT3 neutralization assay”) of purified recombinant IL-21 on Baf3 cells expressing the receptor sequences. “Neutralizing” monoclonal antibodies were identified in this manner.\n\n\nHybridoma pools yielding positive results by the “phosphor-STAT3 neutralization assay” and ELISA formats were cloned at least two times by limiting dilution. In these assays, samples were titrated using standard low density dilution (less than one cell per well) to see which clone will maintain the highest OD reading. Using the results from both the neutralization and titration assays, two specific clones from each initial master well were selected for further analysis. These are subjected to an additional round of cloning to ensure culture homogeneity and screened using the Direct ELISA. After one additional titration assay, two final IL-21 clones were selected. Hybridoma clones were cultured in a growth medium of 90% Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 μg/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 10% Fetal Clone I Serum (Hyclone Laboratories). The clones were propagated by seeding cultures at 2×10\n5 \ncells/ml and maintaining between 1×10\n5 \nand 5×10\n5 \ncell/ml at 37° C. and 5-6% CO\n2\n. Cells were adapted to serum free conditions upon subsequent transfers. Cells are frozen in 90% serum, 10% DMSO and stored in vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer.\n\n\nThe purified monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma clones were characterized in a number of ways including binning (i.e, determining if each antibody could inhibit the binding of any other antibody), epitope mapping using peptides, relative affinity, and neutralization.\n\n\nMethods for producing heterologous antibodies from transgenic mice are known, see for example, Lonberg, \nNat. Biotech. \n23(9):1117-25, 2005; Tomizuka et al. \nPNAS \n97(2):722-727, 2000; and U.S. Pat.

362.78.1.44 Immunoglobulin Heavy and Light Chain Genes in a Mammalian Cell Line to Produce 362.78-CHO\n\n\nHuman anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibody (derived from hybridoma clone 362.78.1.44) was expressed in CHO cells using two expression cassettes. The VH chain was fused to a modified human IgG1 constant region. The modified IgG1, IgG1.1, contained five amino acid substitutions to reduce effector functions. The human anti-human IL-21 heavy chain was linked to a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) selectable marker with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence. The expression of the human anti-human IL-21 heavy chain and the DHFR selectable marker were directed by a constitutive synthetic promoter consisting of a fusion of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer and the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) enhancer/promoter. The simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation signal was used to terminate transcription at the end of the DHFR selectable marker. The VL chain was fused to the human immunoglobulin kappa constant region. The human anti-human IL-21 light chain was linked to a puromycin resistance (puroR) selectable marker with an IRES sequence. The expression of the human anti-human IL-21 light chain and the puroR selectable marker were directed by a constitutive synthetic promoter consisting of a fusion of the human CMV enhancer and the MPSV enhancer/promoter. The SV40 polyadenylation signal was used to terminate transcription at the end of the puroR selectable marker. The human anti-human IL-21 heavy and light chain expression cassettes were co-transfected into CHO DXB-11 host cells. Puromycin selection was followed by methotrexate selection to obtain high, stable expression of human anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibody. The CHO-expressed version of IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 will be referred to in subsequent Examples as “362.78-CHO.”\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 Monoclonal Antibodies Bind Human IL-21 Proteins and Peptides\n\n\n2A.

Plates were incubated overnight at 4° C. after which unbound protein was aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween defined as 0.137M NaCl, 0.0022M KCl, 0.0067M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.0020M KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.05% v/\nw polysorbate\n 20, pH 7.2). Wells were blocked with 200 μL/well of Blocking Buffer (PBS-Tween plus 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 hour, after which the plates were washed twice with Wash Buffer. Antibody dilutions were prepared in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media (IMDM) medium and adjusted to 1 ug/ml. Duplicate samples of each antibody dilution were then transferred to the assay plates, 100 μL/well, in order to bind anti-human IL-21 proteins. Following 1 hour incubation at ambient temperature, the wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled Goat anti Mouse IgG, Fc specific or Goat anti Rat IgG, Fc specific, or Goat anti Human IgG, Fc specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) at a dilution of 1:5000 with 5% FBS/IMDM medium was then added to each well, 100 μL/well, and the plates incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hour. After removal of unbound HRP conjugated antibody, the plates were washed five times, 100 μL/well of tetra methyl benzidine (TMB) (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) added to each well and the plates incubated for 3 minutes at ambient temperature. Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μL/well of 450 nm TMB Stop Reagent (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) and the absorbance values of the wells read on a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX 340 instrument at 450 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal mouse anti-human IL-21 antibody reactivity to human IL-21 protein,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmutant human IL-21 protein and human IL-21 sequence derived peptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-\n\n\nBinding (B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuman\n\n\nNeutralizing\n\n\nPurified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 Ab\n\n\n(N)\n\n\nAb\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone #\n\n\nIsotype\n\n\nLot#\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n \nPeptide\n 1\n\n\n \nPeptide\n 2\n\n\n \nPeptide\n 3\n\n\nPeptide 4\n\n\nmutant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.5.4\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10274\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.11.5\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10276\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.14.3\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10273\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.15.5\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10275\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.28.6\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10329\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.39.5\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10330\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal human anti-human IL-21 antibody reactivity to human IL-21 protein,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmutant human IL-21 protein and human IL-21 sequence derived peptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Anti-\n\n\nBinding (B)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuman IL-21\n\n\n \nNeutralizing\n \n \nPurified\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide\n \n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb\n\n\n(N)\n\n\nAb\n\n\n \n\n\nN-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide 4\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone #\n\n\nIsotype\n\n\nLot#\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n \nTerm\n \n \nPeptide\n \n 2\n\n\nPeptide 3\n\n\nC-Term\n\n\nmutant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1.1\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10364\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1.44\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10554\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.597.3\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10366\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10416\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.345.6.11\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10476\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10435\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2B Measurement of the Binding Affinities of Anti-Human IL-21 Monoclonal Antibody 362.78-CHO to Human IL-21 and Cynomolgus Monkey IL-21 by Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO was evaluated for its binding affinity to human recombinant IL-21 and cynomolgus recombinant IL-21 using surface plasmon resonance.\n\n\nAffinity Determination: Kinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for the interaction of the anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO with human IL-21 and cynomolgus IL-21 via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antibody complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD \n(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Antibodies with similar K\nD \ncan have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring both the k\na \nand k\nd \nof antibodies helps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods: Binding kinetics and affinity studies were performed on a Biacore T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods for the Biacore T100™ were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. For these experiments, the 362.78-CHO antibody was either captured onto a CM4 sensor chip via a goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.), or it was minimally biotinylated with a 1:100 mass ratio of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) in a buffer of PBS pH 7.4 then captured onto a streptavidin (SA) chip. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (Biacore), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0.\n\n\nFor the experiments with the goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody, the capture antibody was diluted to concentration of 50 μg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, and then covalently immobilized to all four flow cells of a CM4 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS). After immobilization of the antibody, the remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. A capture antibody density of approximately 3500 RU was obtained. The anti-IL-21 antibody 362.78-CHO was captured onto \n \nflow cell\n \n 2, 3, and 4 of the CM4 chip at three different densities (ranging from 25 to 150 RU). Capture of the 362.78-CHO antibody to the immobilized surface was performed at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The Biacore instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, capture of the test antibody was verified for each cycle. Serial dilutions of human recombinant IL-21 or cynomolgus recombinant IL-21 (ZymoGenetics) were prepared from 40 nM-0.003 nM (1:5 serial dilutions). The serial dilutions were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the 362.78-CHO antibody captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each IL-21 antigen concentration were performed with an association time of either 6.5 or 7 minutes and dissociation time of either 10, 15, or 60 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 50 μL/min. In between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed both the captured test antibody and any bound antigen from the immobilized antibody surface. The 362.78-CHO antibody was subsequently captured again in the next cycle.\n\n\nFor the experiments with the minimally biotinylated 362.78-CHO, the biotinylated antibody was captured onto \n \nflow cell\n \n 2, 3, and 4 of the SA chip at three different densities (ranging from 150 to 1200 RU). Capture of the biotinylated-362.78-CHO antibody to the surface was performed at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. Serial dilutions of human recombinant IL-21 or cynomolgus recombinant IL-21 (ZymoGenetics) were prepared either from 50 nM-0.001 nM (1:4 serial dilutions) or from 40 nM-0.003 nM (1:5 serial dilutions). These serial dilutions were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the 362.78-CHO antibody captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each IL-21 antigen concentration were performed with an association time of either 6.5 or 7 minutes and dissociation time of either 10, 15, or 60 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 50 μL/min. In between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed any bound antigen from the immobilized antibody surface. The wash cycle did not remove the biotinylated 362.78-CHO antibody from the sensor surface, and the antibody was subsequently available to bind the next antigen sample.\n\n\nData was compiled using the BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Duplicate injection curves were checked for reproducibility. Based on the binding of the monovalent IL-21 to a bivalent antibody, the 1:1 binding interaction model was determined to be appropriate. The reference-subtracted binding curves from three flow cells (FC2-1, FC3-1, FC4-1) were globally fit to the 1:1 binding model with a multiple Rmax and with the RI set to zero. The data fit well to the 1:1 binding model with good agreement between the experimental and theoretical binding curves. The chi\n2 \nand standard errors associated the fits were low. There was no trending in the residuals.\n\n\nResults: For the interaction of 362.78-CHO with human IL-21, data was compiled from four separate experiments. The k\na \nof the multiple experiments ranged from 3E+07 to 5+07 (M\n−1\ns\n−1\n), while the k\nd \nranged from 3E-06 to 3E-05 (s-1). The calculated K\nD \nranged from 0.9E-13 to 8E-13 (M).\n\n\nFor the interaction of 362.78-CHO with cynomolgus IL-21 data was compiled from three separate experiments. The k\na \nwas 3E+07 (M\n−1\ns\n−1\n) for each experiment, while the k\nd \nranged from 2E-04 to 5E-04 (s\n−1\n). The calculated K\nD \nranged from 0.9E-11 to 2E-11 (M).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nSpecies Cross Reactivity Experiments\n\n\nDetermination of ability of anti-human IL-21 antibodies to cross-react and bind murine or cynomolgus monkey IL-21 protein or human IL-21 sequence derived synthetic peptides\n\n\nSpecies cross-reactivity studies can be important to demonstrate specificity for therapeutic antagonist development strategies. In order to determine whether the anti-human IL-21 binding and neutralizing entities described herein may cross-react and bind to murine or cynomolgus IL-21 (and therefore, justify the cynomolgus monkey or mouse as a viable test species), it was necessary to demonstrate comparable binding of the antibodies to recombinant human, murine and cynomolgus monkey IL-21 in the various assay formats. One of the methods for testing binding of the monoclonal antibodies is by their performance in immunoblot (Western blot) assays. Recombinant human IL-21 (SEQ ID NO:2), recombinant murine IL-21 (SEQ ID NO:11), recombinant cynomolgus IL-21 (SEQ ID NO:9), human IL-21 sequence derived synthetic peptides: \npeptide #\n1 pyr30-K50 (Seq ID 3), \npeptide #\n2 N54-C71 (Seq ID NO:4), \npeptide #\n3 N97-C122 (Seq ID NO:5), peptide #4 C125-S153 (Seq ID NO:6) conjugated to ovalbumin, or an irrelevant control cytokine, recombinant human IFN-λ (ZymoGenetics) were submitted to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 4-12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Inc.) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods and a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 186 mM glycine and 40% methanol.\n\n\nFor Western blots, the non-specific sites on the membranes were blocked with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, and 1% casein hydrolysate blocking solution (Western Blocking Reagent, Roche Diagnostics, Inc., Basel Switerzerland) (Blocking Buffer). The membranes were then incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature with purified monoclonal antibody (10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml) in the Blocking Buffer followed by a 2 hr incubation with peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.). The membranes were washed 5 times with the Tris/EDTA/IGEPAL/NaCl/gelatin Blocking buffer which lacked the casein hydrolysate and developed with SUPERSIGNAL™ DuraWest Luminol/Enhancer/Peroxidase Solution (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) for chemoluminescence detection. The blots were visualized using X-ray film based standard methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Human Anti-Human IL-21 Antibody Reactivity in Western Blot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu IL-\n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\n \n\n\nMu\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone*\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nCyno IL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nA1744\n\n\nA1750\n\n\nA1751\n\n\nA1752\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.35.1.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.37.3\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1.1\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.108.1.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.172.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.216.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.256.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.303.1.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.378.1\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.468.3\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.564.1.4\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.597.3\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.632.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.342.8\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.345.6.11\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.353.11.12\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.398.36\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.453.30\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.462.24.10\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.479.13\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.565.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.618.20\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n367.752.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n368.626.24\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*No Signals Observed with IFN-λ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Peptides were Conjugated to Ovalbumin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nEvaluation of the Ability of Anti-Human IL-21 Antibodies to Cross-React and Bind the Human γc-Family Cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15\n\n\nAnother important characteristic of a specific antibody is the ability of the antibody to bind to and antagonize the target protein(s) but to not bind related proteins (non-target) to a significant degree. The ability of anti-human IL-21 antibodies to bind to related cytokines was tested in the Western blot format. Samples of all members of the γc-cytokine family were obtained and run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for blotting. Recombinant human IL-2 (202-IL/CF), human IL-4 (204-IL/CF), human IL-7 (207-IL/CF), human IL-9 (209-IL/CF), human IL-15 (247-IL/CF) all obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis Minn.), human IL-21 (ZymoGenetics) and human IFN-λ (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,927,040; 7,252,969) were used to evaluate the specificity of the antibodies. All of the antibodies tested showed no detectable binding above background to the γc-family cytokines except for human IL-21 where clear binding was observed, consistent with previous Western blots using these antibodies (see Example 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Anti-Human IL-21 Antibody Reactivity to γc\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncytokines in Western Blot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIFNλ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nnegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone\n\n\nIL-2\n\n\nIL-4\n\n\nIL-7\n\n\nIL-9\n\n\nIL-15\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.597.3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.564.1.4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10.63\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11.31\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Mouse and Rat Anti-Human IL-21 Antibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity in Western Blot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu\n\n\n+Hu\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\n \n\n\nMu\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone*\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nCyno IL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nA1744\n\n\nA1750\n\n\nA1751\n\n\nA1752\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse Clones\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.5.4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.11.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.14.3\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.15.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.17.3\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.24.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.25.6\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.28.6\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.29.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.39.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat Clones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272.19.1.1.4.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272.21.1.3.4.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*No Signals Observed with IFN-λ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Peptides were Conjugated to Ovalbumin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nCompetitive Epitope Binning Studies\n\n\nEpitope binning experiments were performed to determine which anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding simultaneously to human IL-21. Both human and mouse antibodies were represented. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that compete for the same, or an overlapping, binding site (epitope) on the antigen are not able to bind simultaneously and are functionally grouped into a single family or “epitope bin”. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that do not compete for the same binding site on the antigen are able to bind simultaneously and are grouped into separate families or “epitope bins”. Experiments were performed using a BIACORE T100™ instrument. Epitope binning experiments were performed with soluble, (ZymoGenetics) human IL-21 as the antigen.\n\n\nEpitope binning studies were performed on a BIACORE T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. Individual anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were covalently immobilized to separate flow cells of a BIACORE CM4 sensor chip. Subsequently, the IL-21 antigen was injected and allowed to specifically bind to the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the sensor chip. The BIACORE instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, immobilization of the primary antibody of a test pair and specific binding of the IL-21 antigen to the primary antibody were verified for each test cycle. Following the binding of the IL-21 antigen, a secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was injected and allowed to bind. If the secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, an increase in mass on the surface of the chip, or binding, was detected. If, however, the secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, no additional mass, or binding, was detected. Each anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody tested against itself was used as the negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal.\n\n\nA series of experiments was completed to test the binding properties of purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies obtained from hydridoma fusions of the spleens of mice immune to human IL-21. The first anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody of a test pair was covalently immobilized using EDC:NHS to a density of approximately 1000 RU. The IL-21 antigen was diluted to 100 nM and allowed to flow over the surface of the immobilized antibody. Subsequently, the secondary antibody of a test pair was diluted to 5 μg/mL (approximately 32.2 nM) and allowed to bind to the captured IL-21 antigen. A subset of the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies was tested as the primary antibody in combination with the full panel of secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies. Binding experiments were performed with a flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25° C. The buffer for these studies consisted of 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P20, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Between cycles, the antibody on the chip was regenerated with 20 mM hydrochloric acid. Data was compiled using BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1), then loaded into EXCEL™ for additional data processing.\n\n\nPurified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were characterized and assigned into epitope bins. The signal (RU, response units) reported by the BIACORE is directly correlated to the mass on the sensor chip surface. Once the level of background signal (RU) associated with the negative controls was established (the same anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody used as both the primary and secondary antibody), the binning results were reported as either positive or negative binding. Positive binding indicates that two different anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. Negative binding indicates that two different anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. The differential between positive and negative response values in this experiment was significant and allowed for an unambiguous assignment of the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies into six distinct families, or epitope bins. The first epitope bin was represented by anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies from, for example, clones 338.5.4; 362.78.1; and 362.597.3. The second bin was represented by anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies from, for example, clones 338.14.3; 362.75.1.1; and 366.328.10. An additional third bin was found to overlap the binding epitopes of the \nbin #\n1 and \nbin #\n2 antibodies. It was represented by monoclonal antibody from, for example, clone 366.552.11. Antibodies that neutralize IL-21 are found in each of these three bins.\n\n\nThree additional epitope bins were identified. Each of these bins was represented by monoclonal antibody from, for example, hybridoma clones 366.345.6.11 (bin #4), 338.28.6 (bin#5), and 338.39.5 (bin#6). The antibodies identified in these three bins do not neutralize human IL-21 bioactivity.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nSoluble Receptor Competition Studies\n\n\nCompetition experiments were performed to determine which anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding IL-21 simultaneously with the IL-21 soluble receptor. Anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that compete with the soluble receptor for the same, or an overlapping, binding site (epitope) on the antigen are not able to bind simultaneously. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that do not compete with the soluble receptor for the same binding site on the antigen are able to bind simultaneously. Competition experiments were performed with soluble, recombinant human IL-21 as the antigen. The IL-21 antigen was allowed to bind the monoclonal antibody prior to competition with the IL-21 soluble receptor. Two versions of the IL-21 soluble receptor (both produced by ZymoGenetics) were utilized for monoclonal antibody analysis in these studies: One version of the receptor consists of a homodimeric receptor (IL-21R-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of the IL-21 receptor fused to an Fc molecule derived from human immunoglobulin. The second soluble receptor form was a heterodimeric receptor (IL-21R/γc-Fc) composed of one subunit comprising the extracellular domain of the IL-21 receptor fused to an Fc molecule derived from human immunoglobulin and a second subunit comprising the extracellular domain of the common γ common-chain fused to an Fc molecule derived from human immunoglobulin, as described in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,539 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nCompetition studies were performed on a BIACORE T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. Individual anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were covalently immobilized to separate flow cells of a BIACORE CM4 sensor chip. Subsequently, the IL-21 antigen (SEQ ID NO: 2) was injected and allowed to specifically bind to the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the sensor chip. The Biacore instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, immobilization of the primary antibody and specific binding of the IL-21 antigen to the primary antibody were verified for each test cycle. Following the binding of the IL-21 antigen, the soluble receptor was injected and allowed to bind. If the soluble receptor was capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, an increase in mass on the surface of the chip, or binding, was detected. If, however, the soluble receptor was not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, no additional mass, or binding, was detected. Each anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody tested against itself was used as the negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal. As a positive control, each anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was tested against an anti-IL-21 antibody from a different epitope bin to determine the level of positive (binding) signal.\n\n\nA series of experiments were completed to test the binding properties of 5 purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies (from hybridoma clones 362.78.1, 366.75.1.1, 366.328.10, 366.552.11.31, and 366.345.6.11) that bind human IL-21. The first anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody of a test pair was covalently immobilized using a mixture of 0.4 M EDC [N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide] and 0.1 M NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) to a density of approximately 1000 RU. After immobilization of the antibody, the active sites on the flow cell were blocked with 1M ethanolamine. The IL-21 antigen was diluted to 100 nM and allowed to flow over the surface of the immobilized antibody. Subsequently, the soluble receptor was diluted to 10 μg/mL and allowed to bind to the captured IL-21 antigen. Binding experiments were performed with a flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25° C. The buffer for these studies consisted of 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P20, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed the IL-21 antigen and any bound soluble receptor from the immobilized antibody surface, and allowed for the subsequent binding of the next test sample. Data was compiled using BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1).\n\n\nPurified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were characterized for their ability to compete with the human IL-21 soluble receptor for binding to the IL-21 antigen. The signal (RU, response units) reported by the BIACORE is directly correlated to the mass on the sensor chip surface. Once the level of background signal (RU) associated with the negative controls was established (the same anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody used as both the primary and secondary antibody), the competition results were reported as either positive or negative binding. Positive binding indicates that the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody and IL-21 soluble receptor are capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. Negative binding indicates that the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody and the IL-21 soluble receptor are not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. The differential between positive and negative response values in this experiment was significant and allowed for an unambiguous determination of competition between the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies and IL-21 soluble receptor.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies from hybridoma clones 362.78.1 and 366.552.11.31 competed with both versions of the IL-21 soluble receptor (homodimeric IL-21R-Fc and heterodimeric IL-21R/γc-Fc) for binding to the human IL-21 antigen. Monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma clones 366.328.10 and 366.345.6.11 did not compete with either version of the soluble receptor for binding to the antigen. The monoclonal antibody from hybridoma clone 362.75.1.1 showed partial competition for binding with both forms of the soluble receptor. These studies were performed with the IL-21 antigen pre-bound to the monoclonal antibody. Three of these antibodies (362.78.1, 366.328.10, 366.552.11.31) have been shown to neutralize human IL-21 while the monoclonal antibody antibodies from hybridoma clones 362.75.1.1 and 366.345.6.11 are, depending on the assay, very weak, or non-neutralizers of human IL-21 bioactivity.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nIL-21 Baf3/huIL-21R STAT3 Bioactivity Assay\n\n\nThe following phosphorylated-STAT3 bioassay was used as a primary screen to measure neutralizing anti-IL-21 titers in murine serum as well as relative levels of IL-21 neutralization by hybridoma supernatants and purified anti-IL-21 antibodies. IL-21 activity was determined by measuring the level of STAT3-phosphorylation following ligand-receptor interaction in Baf3/KZ134/huIL-21R cells (see Spolski and Leonard, \nAnnu Rev Immunol\n. Nov. 8, 2007). Relative neutralization activity was determined based on the decrease in phosphorylated-STAT3 levels using an EC\n50 \nconcentration of IL-21 and a titration of antagonist.\n\n\nBaf3/KZ134/huIL-21R cells were washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× Glutamax, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, and 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol; all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) before being plated out at 40,000 cells/well in 96-well, round-bottom tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Cells were placed in a 37° C. tissue culture incubator while the test solutions were prepared. To determine EC\n50 \nand EC\n90 \nconcentrations of IL-21 in this assay, serial dilutions of recombinant human IL-21 were prepared in assay media and plated in a separate 96-well U-bottom plate. Alternatively, to test for IL-21 neutralization, an EC\n50 \nconcentration of IL-21 (determined to be 33 pM) was preincubated with serial dilutions of IL-21-immunized mouse serum, spent hybridoma media, purified soluble human IL-21R/γc-Fc or purified monoclonal anti-IL-21 antibodies. Both the cell plate and the solution plate were then incubated in a humidified tissue culture chamber to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. After 30 minutes, the reaction was initiated by transferring the IL-21 solutions to the cell plate and incubating for 10 minutes at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\nFollowing the 10 minute incubation, reactions were stopped by placing the plate on ice and adding 125 μL of ice-cold Cell Wash Buffer (BIO-PLEX Cell Lysis Kit, BIO-RAD Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) to each well. Cells were then spun down at 1500 rpm at 4° C. for 5 minutes and the media aspirated. To lyse the cells, 50 μL/well Lysis Buffer (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, BIO-RAD Labs) was added to each well. The cell lysates were then pipetted up and down five times while on ice, and agitated on a microplate platform shaker for 20 minutes at 600 rpm at 4° C. Plates were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4° C. for 20 minutes. Supernatants were collected and transferred to a new micro titer plate and mixed 1:1 with Assay Buffer (BIO-RAD) for storage at −20° C.\n\n\nCapture beads (BIO-PLEX Phospho-STAT3 Assay, BIO-RAD Laboratories) were diluted and plated in a 96-well filter plate (Millipore Corporation, Ireland) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plates were washed two times with Wash Buffer (BIO-RAD) and 50 μL of cell lysate mix was transferred to each well. Each plate was then wrapped in aluminum foil and shaken overnight at room temperature and 300 rpm. The following day, the plate was transferred to a microtiter vacuum apparatus and washed two times with Wash Buffer. After addition of 25 μL/well detection antibody (BIO-RAD), the foil-covered plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with shaking at 300 rpm. The plate was filtered and washed two times with wash buffer. Streptavidin-PE (BIO-RAD; 50 μL/well) was added, and the foil-covered plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with shaking at 300 rpm. The plate was filtered and washed two times and resuspended in 125 μL/well Bead Resuspension Buffer (BIO-RAD). The level of phosphorylated-STAT3 was then assessed using an array reader (BIO-PLEX, BIO-RAD Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using analytical software (BIO-PLEX MANAGER 3.0, BIO-RAD Laboratories). Increases in the level of the phosphorylated STAT3 transcription factor present in the lysates were indicative of an IL-21 receptor-ligand interaction. For the neutralization assay, decreases in the level of the phosphorylated STAT3 transcription factor present in the lysates were indicative of neutralization of the IL-21 receptor-ligand interaction. IC\n50 \n(concentration of antagonist that yields 50 percent inhibition of ligand activity) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism®4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego Calif.) and expressed as molar concentrations for each reagent in the neutralization assay.\n\n\nHuman IL-21 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner with an EC\n50 \nconcentration determined to be approximately 33 pM. Table 7 summarizes the IC\n50 \nvalues for the positive control (soluble human IL-21R/γc-Fc fusion protein) and the IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein. These data indicate that the IL-21 neutralizing antibodies were active and were equal to or better than the positive control at reducing IL-21-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC\n50 \nValues in STAT3-Phosphorylation Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nExpt #\n1\n\n\n \nExpt #\n2\n\n\n \nExpt #\n3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoluble hIL-21R/γc-Fc\n\n\n25\n\n\n102\n\n\n140.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 mAb Clone #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1\n\n\nNo Neut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n14\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1.44\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n66.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78-CHO (A2162F)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10.63\n\n\n210\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11.31\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.345.6.11\n\n\nWeak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\nExpt\n 3 conducted using 96 pM IL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nIL-21 Baf/huIL-21R STAT-Luciferase Bioactivity Assay\n\n\nThis 24-hour assay measures IL-21-induced STAT-Luciferase activity in Baf3/KZ134/huIL-21R transfected cells. Baf3/KZ134/huIL-21R transfected cells were washed two times with assay media (phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× Glutamax, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, and 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol; all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) before being plated out at 40,000 cells/well in a 96-well, flat-bottom opaque white culture plates (Corning/Costar, Lowell, Mass.). Cells were then placed in a tissue culture incubator while the test solutions were prepared. In a separate plate, human IL-21 was mixed with either media or a range of IL-21 antagonists (either monoclonal antibodies or the soluble human IL-21 receptor/γc-Fc). Once mixed, this plate was also transferred to a humidified 37° C. tissue culture incubator. After 30 minutes the test solutions were transferred to the cell plate and mixed. This plate was then placed back in the incubator for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells were removed from the incubator and allowed to cool to room temperature. Each well was then diluted 1:1 with a 100 μL volume of Steady-Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and mixed thoroughly. The plate was covered and shaken at room temperature for 10 minutes and Relative Luciferase Units (RLU) were measured on a luminometer.\n\n\nTo determine EC\n50 \nand EC\n90 \nconcentrations of IL-21 in this assay, serial dilutions of recombinant human IL-21 ranging from 0 to 100 ng/mL were tested. The EC\n90 \nconcentration of IL-21, ˜15 ng/mL (961 pM), was used in subsequent neutralization experiments. In these experiments, clones 362.78.1 (and its subclone 362.78.1.44 and CHO-expressed counterpart, 362.78-CHO; see Example 1) and 362.328.10.63 demonstrated the most potent anti-IL-21 activity, with IC\n50 \nconcentrations in the range of 300-850 pM, while the IC\n50 \nvalues for the soluble human IL-21 receptor/γc-Fc control ranged from 650-1830 pM.

In order to determine whether the anti-human IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein might cross-react and neutralize the activity induced by cynomolgus IL-21, murine IL-21 or rat IL-21 (and therefore, justify either cynomolgus monkeys, mice and/or rats as viable test species), it was first necessary to demonstrate recombinant cynomolgus, murine and rat IL-21 bioactivity. The methods for IL-21 STAT-Luciferase activity assays described in Example 8 were used to determine EC\n50 \nand EC\n90 \nvalues for recombinant human IL-21, cynomolgus IL-21, murine IL-21, and rat IL-21 (all produced at ZymoGenetics). Results indicate that the levels of STAT-Luciferase activity induced by the human, cynomolgus and murine IL-21 in this assay differ widely. EC\n90 \nvalues used in subsequent experiments were determined to be as follows: 961 pM for human IL-21; 102 pM for cynomolgus monkey IL-21; 6.41 nM for mouse IL-21, and 1.08 nM for rat IL-21. IL-21 soluble receptor (hIL-21R/γc-Fc) neutralized the effects of cynomolgus, murine and rat.\n\n\nIL-21. Addition of the purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies shown in Table 9 neutralized cynomolgus IL-21 to varying degrees but did not neutralize murine or rat IL-21 (note that only 362.78-CHO and 366.552.11 were tested against rat IL-21). The IC\n50 \nvalues for neutralization of cynomolgus IL-21 by the neutralizing entities described herein ranged from ˜100 pM to 431 pM and are summarized in Table 9. It should be noted that the best human IL-21 neutralizing antibodies were all able to effectively neutralize cynomolgus IL-21 but not murine IL-21 or rat IL-21. Additionally, the CHO-cell produced IL-21 mAb (362.78-CHO) was tested in a separate experiment using an 800 pM concentration of cynomolgus monkey IL-21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-reaction of hIL-21 antagonists to cynomolgus monkey, murine and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat IL-21 in the STAT-Luciferase assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCyno IL-21 IC\n50\n \n\n\nMurine IL-21 IC50\n\n\nRat IL-21 IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n([cIL-21] =\n\n\n([mIL-21] =\n\n\n([rIL-21] =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100 pM)\n\n\n6.41 nM)\n\n\n1.08 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nng/mL\n\n\nMolar conc.\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\nMolar conc.\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\nMolar conc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoluble hIL-21R/γc-\nFc\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n385 pM\n\n\n425.8\n\n\n8.06 nM\n\n\n707.5\n\n\n13.4 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 mAb Clone:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1\n\n\nweak\n\n\n—\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n60\n\n\n400 pM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78-CHO (A2162F)*\n\n\n255 \n\n\n 1.7 nM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\n15\n\n\n100 pM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\n23\n\n\n156 pM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n65\n\n\n431 pM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Note: Clone 362.78-CHO (Example 1b) was tested using an 800 pM concentration of cIL-21 instead of 100 pM as was used in other experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/T = not tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nEvaluation of Potential Cross-Reaction to IL-4 in a Cell-Based Assay\n\n\nWhen developing a therapeutic cytokine antagonist, it is important to know if it will cross-react with and neutralize structurally related cytokines. This primary B cell proliferation assay was designed to test the IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein for cross-reaction to and neutralization of human IL-4.\n\n\nIsolation of primary B cells: To obtain primary B cells, 200 mL peripheral blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics). Blood was diluted to 400 ml with room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were made in 50 ml conical tubes. Fourteen mL of room temperature Ficoll/Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was aspirated and washed two times with MACS buffer (PBS, \nHEPES\n 20 mM, and 1% BSA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were counted and B cells were negatively selected using the B Cell Isolation Kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, Calif.) following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer. A small sample of the purified B cells were tested for purity by FACS analysis and found to be >97% pure CD19\n+\n B cells in all experiments.\n\n\nProliferation assay: B cells proliferate in response to IL-4 co-culture with immobilized anti-IgM. To determine potential cross-reaction to and neutralization of IL-4 by anti-IL-21 mAbs, previously isolated B cells were first plated at 40,000-50,000 cells/well in a 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) that had been pre-coated with 1.0 μg/mL anti-IgM (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala.). The cells were then treated with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, Minn.) and a titration series of an IL-21 antagonist (test antibodies or controls). The cells were then incubated for 3 days at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified tissue culture incubator. After three days, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After 16 hours, the cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters and the amount of [\n3\nH]-incorporation was quantitated using a beta counter (Topcount NXT, Packard). None of the three anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies tested (362.78.1, 366.328.10.6 and 366.552.11.31) showed any neutralization of IL-4-induced proliferation at up to a 250-fold molar excess.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n11A. Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reaction to IL-2 and IL-15 in a Cell-Based Assay\n\n\nWhen developing a therapeutic cytokine antagonist, it is important to determine if it will cross-react with and neutralize structurally related cytokines. The murine T cell line, CTLL-2, can be induced to proliferate in response to human IL-2 or IL-15. Therefore, this assay was chosen to test the IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein for cross-reaction to and neutralization of human IL-2 and IL-15.\n\n\nCTLL-2 cells were washed three times in proliferation bioassay media (\nRPMI\n 1640, 2× Glutamax, 10% FBS, 2× NaPyr, 1× B-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM Hepes; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), and plated at 50000 cells per well in 96-well round bottom tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Falls, N.J.). To these cells, a predetermined EC\n90 \ndose of either IL-2 (3.0 ng/mL) or IL-15 (0.5 ng/mL) in combination with a serial dilution of the IL-21 neutralizing entireties was added. The ratio of cytokine to antibody ranged from a 250-fold molar excess to a 1:1 ratio. Anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-15 neutralizing antibodies (both from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) were used as positive controls. The cells were then incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified tissue culture incubator. After 24 hours, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Sixteen hours later, the cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters and the amount of [\n3\nH]-incorporation was quantitated using a beta counter (Topcount NXT, Packard).\n\n\nResults: None of the three anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies tested (362.78.1, 366.328.10.6 and 366.552.11.31) showed any neutralization of IL-2 or IL-15-induced proliferation.\n\n\n11B.—Confirmation Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) that IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO Does Not Bind IL-21-Related Human Cytokines IL-2 IL-4 IL-7 IL-9 or IL-15\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was evaluated via surface plasmon resonance for potential cross reactivity to human IL-2, human IL-4, human IL-7, human IL-9, and human IL-15.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods: Experiments were completed to test the cross reactivity of the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO for human IL-2, human IL-4, human IL-7, human IL-9, and human IL-15. Binding studies were performed on a BIACORE T100™ (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 2.0. Goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) was covalently immobilized to flow \n \ncells\n \n 1 and 2 of a CM4 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS). The purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO was subsequently captured onto \nflow cell\n 2 of the sensor chip at a density of approximately 240 RU. Flow \ncell\n 1 was used as the reference surface.\n\n\nIL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (all purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) were injected over the captured antibody surface (flow cell 2) and the reference flow cell (flow cell 1) at concentrations of 100, 20, and 4 nM. As a positive control for this set of experiments, IL-21 (produced at ZymoGenetics) was also injected at identical concentrations. Binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 25 μL/min, an association time of 2 minutes, and a dissociation time of 3 minutes. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (Biacore), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed both the captured 362.78-CHO antibody and any bound antigen from the chip surface. Data was compiled using BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 2.0). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections.\n\n\nResults: No binding of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, or IL-15 to the 362.78-CHO antibody was observed. In contrast, the IL-21 positive control demonstrated a dose dependent binding that was consistent with previous studies.\n\n\nThis lack of cross-reactivity was subsequently explained by epitope mapping studies of clone 362.78 (see Example 17). The amino acids located in and near the D-helix of IL-21 shown to be bound by clone 362.78 (EKKPPKEFLERFKSLL; SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 144)) are not well-conserved among the related human gamma-chain cytokines, nor within mouse IL-21, as shown below in Table 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L21_HUMAN\n\n\n------TCPSCDSY\nEKK--PPKEFLERFKSLL\nQKMIHQHLSSTHGSEDS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L21_MOUSE\n\n\n------KCPSCDSYEKR--TPKEFLERLKWLLQKMIHQHLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L15_HUMAN\n\n\n-------CKECEELEEK--NIKEFLQSFVHIVQMFINTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L2_HUMAN\n\n\n------TTFMCEYADET-ATIVEFLNRWITFCQSIISTLT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L4_HUMAN\n\n\n---GLAGLNSCPVKEANQSTLENFLERLKTIMREKYSKCSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L7_HUMAN\n\n\n----SLEENKSLKEQKK-LNDLCFLKRLLQEIKTCWNKILMGTKEH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1L9_HUMAN\n\n\n------CEQPCNQTTAG--NALTFLKSLLEIFQKEKMRGMRGKI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:2; IL-21 mouse is shown as SEQ ID NO:11; IL-15 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:92; IL-2 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:93; IL-4 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:94; IL-7 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:95; IL-9 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:96.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nB Cell Proliferation Assays\n\n\nPrimary B Cell Assays\n\n\nTo further test the activity of the IL-21 neutralizing entities, two primary B cell assays were developed. The B cell proliferation assay was used to demonstrate neutralization of IL-21 induced proliferation over 4 days and the B cell differentiation assay demonstrated the neutralization of IL-21 induced plasma cell differentiation over 8 days. These experiments demonstrated neutralization of IL-21 in long-term biologically relevant assays.\n\n\nIsolation of primary human B cells: To obtain primary B cells, 200 mL peripheral blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics). Blood was diluted with 200 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were made in 50 mL conical tubes. Fourteen mL of room temperature Ficoll/Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was aspirated and washed two times with MACS buffer (PBS, \nHEPES\n 20 mM, and 1% BSA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were counted and B cells were negatively selected using the B Cell Isolation Kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, Calif.) following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer. A small sample of the purified B cells were tested for purity by FACS analysis and found to be >97% pure in all experiments.\n\n\nProliferation assay: B cells proliferate in response to co-culture with anti-CD40 and IL-21. To determine the neutralization activity of the anti-IL-21 mAbs, B cells were plated at 40000-50000 cells/well in a 96-well U-bottom tissue culture treated plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The cells were then treated with 0.1 μg/mL anti-CD40 (goat anti-human CD40 polyclonal; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), 50 ng/mL (3.21 nM) recombinant IL-21 (ZymoGenetics, A1207F) and a titration of an IL-21 antagonist (test mAbs or controls). The plate of cells was then incubated for 3 days at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator. After three days, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After 16 hours, the cells were then harvested onto glass-fiber filters and the amount of [\n3\nH]-incorporation was quantitated using a beta counter (Topcount NXT, Packard). IC\n50 \ncurves measuring the effective neutralization of IL-21-induced proliferation were calculated and expressed as a molar concentration. The IC\n50 \nvalues for the top neutralizing mAbs described herein ranged from 0.71 nM to 6.55 nM and are summarized in Table 11:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralization of IL-21 in B Cell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21 Antagonist\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsoluble hIL-21R/γc-Fc\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n362.75.1\n\n\nNo Neutralization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n1.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n6.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB Cell Differentiation Assay: The differentiation of naïve B cells into antibody-producing plasma cells is greatly facilitated in vitro when IL-21 is combined with anti-CD40 and IL-4 (Ettinger et al., \nJ Immunol. \n175:7867-79, 2005; Ettinger et al, \nJ Immunol. \n178:2872-82, 2007; Kuchen et al. \nJ Immunol. \n179:5886-96, 2007). To demonstrate activity in a longer term assay than the two Baf3-based screening assays described in Examples 7 and 8, the neutralizing entities described herein were used to neutralize IL-21 and inhibit human plasma cell differentiation. To accomplish this, primary human B cells were plated at 150,000 cells/well in a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture treated plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The cells were then treated with 0.1 g/mL anti-CD40 (goat anti-human CD40 polyclonal; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems) and 25 ng/mL (1.6 nM) recombinant human IL-21 (ZymoGenetics). IL-21 antagonists (test mAbs or controls) were then added and the cells incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nfor eight days in a humidified incubator. At the end of eight days, conditioned medias were collected (for antibody titers) and cells pelleted for subsequent flow cytometry analysis.\n\n\nB cell analysis using flow cytometry: Cells were resuspended in human FACS buffer (HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, 1% BSA (all from Invitrogen) and 2% Human Ab Serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, Calif.)) for five minutes to block Fc receptors. Cells were then centrifuged (5 minutes at 1200 rpm) and aspirated. Stains were prepared by diluting antibodies 1:100 in human FACS buffer and dispensing 100 μL per sample. Single stains (to adjust cytomer compensation settings) and a multi-stain mixture were prepared using the following antibodies: anti-CD138-FITC, anti-IgD-PE, anti-CD38-PE-Cy5.5 and anti-CD19-APC. Plasma cells were defined as large (assessed by forward light scatter) CD19\n+\n, IgD\nlo\n, CD38\n+\n and CD138\n+\n cells. The percentage of plasma cells relative to total B cells was used to determine effectiveness of the neutralizing entities described herein.\n\n\nResults: When IL-21 was combined with IL-4 and anti-CD40, approximately 50% of the live, large B cells on day 8 were IgD\nlow\n, CD138\n+\n plasma cells. Without IL-21, the proportion of plasma cells was ˜8% of the large B cells. The addition of the various IL-21 antagonists to the IL-21-containing cultures decreased the proportion of plasma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Clone 362.78.1 was the most effective neutralizer, and almost completely neutralized IL-21 activity at the 10:1 and 2.5:1 antagonist:ligand ratios. The other antibodies tested, clones 366.328.10.63 and 366.552.11.31 were nearly as effective at neutralizing the IL-21 driven differentiation.

A DTH response is a good indicator of a CD4+ T cell mediated response. Mice are immunized sub-cutaneously with chicken ovalbumin protein (OVA) in either of 2 adjuvants, Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA; Sigma) or Ribi (Sigma; aka MPL+TDM+CWS adjuvant). This phase is called the sensitization phase (days 0-6). Ear measurements are taken seven days later. Mice are then injected in the ear with control PBS (left ear) or OVA (right ear). This phase is called the challenge phase (days 7-8). Immune responses generated to OVA induce inflammation in the ear resulting an increase in ear thickness in 24 hours in the OVA-treated, but not in the PBS-treated ear. This is measured using calipers.\n\n\nC57BL/6 mice (n=8/group) are immunized in the back with 100 μg chicken ovalbumin (OVA) emulsified in CFA in a total volume of 200 μl. If Ribi is used instead of CFA, 0.5 mg/ml of ovalbumin is added to a single vial of RIBI and vortexed vigorously for 2 minutes to form an emulsion that is used to inject mice. Seven days after the immunization, mice are injected with 10 μl PBS in the left ear (control) and with 10 μg OVA in PBS in the right ear in a volume of 10 μl. Ear thickness of all mice is measured before injecting mice in the ear (0 measurement). Ear thickness is measured 24 hours after challenge. The difference in ear thickness between the 0 measurement and the 24 hour measurement is calculated and is reflective of the inflammation in the ear. Groups of mice are injected with PBS or different concentration of anti-IL-21 antibody intra-peritoneally from either days 0-6 (sensitization phase) or from days 7-8 (challenge phase). The injection on day 7 and 8 is given 2 hours before measuring ear thickness at the 0 and 24 hour time points. At the end of the 24 hour period, once ear thickness was measured, the ears were cut and placed in formalin for histological analysis.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nMouse Model for Multiple Sclerosis\n\n\nTo test if anti-IL-21 has any effects on multiple sclerosis, the ability of anti-IL-21 antibodies to inhibit experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE-MS), a mouse model for MS is tested. The well characterized T cell-dependent myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 peptide immunization model in C57BL/6 mice is used. The experiment is run to determine that anti-IL-21 antibody could delay and/or inhibit disease scores in EAE either by inhibiting DC mediated antigen presentation or by enhancing CD8 T cell responses. Absence of efficient CD8 T cell responses in this model exacerbates EAE (Malipiero et. al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n27:3151-3160, 1997). Delayed onset of disease in the EAE model in a dose dependent manner suggests that use of anti-IL-21 antibody may be beneficial in MS.\n\n\nEAE is a mouse model for MS. In one such model, C57BL/6 mice are immunized with 100 μg MOG peptide (MOG35-55) or 100 μg recombinant MOG protein emulsified in CFA adjuvant. Two milliliters of a 0.5 mg/ml preparation of the MOG35-55 in PBS is added to a vial of CFA and vortexed vigorously to emulsify the solution or a 1:1 ratio of recombinant MOG in CFA is prepared. The backs of mice are shaved and 100 μg MOG/CFA is injected s.c in the backs of mice. Weights of mice are taken 2 days before and every day after the immunization. Mice are then injected on \nday\n 2 i.v. with 200 μl pertussis toxin (PT), a final concentration of 200 ng/mouse. Mice are monitored daily for clinical scores. Groups of mice are injected i.p. with 200 μl PBS, 100 μg BSA, 10 μg-200 μg anti-IL-21 antibody in a 2001 volume from days 0-20, or 3× a week for 3 weeks. The weights of mice, clinical scores and incidence are evaluated and plotted for analysis.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nAnti-mIL-21 Antibody Decreases Disease Incidence and Progression in a Mouse Model of T-Cell Adoptive Transfer Colitis and Psoriasis\n\n\nAdoptive transfer of naive T cells into minor histocompatibility mismatched or syngeneic immunocompromised mice leads to development of colitis (Leach M W et al 1996, Powrie F et al, 1997) as well as skin lesions resembling psoriasis (Schon M P et al., \nNat Med. \n2:183-8, 1997; Davenport C M et al., \nInt Immunopharmacol. \n5:653-72, 2002). Transplantation of as few as 0.2 million CD4+CD25− T cells from BALB/C or B10.D2 mice into immunocompromised C.B-17 SCID mice results in weight loss, hemoccult positive stool and development of skin lesions. The symptoms in these mice vary from colony to colony.\n\n\nThis model of colitis/psoriasis has some similarities to human Crohn's disease and psoriasis, and has been used extensively to test efficacy of therapeutics for these diseases in humans. For this experiment, mice (8 B10.D2 female mice donors; 50 C.B-17 SCID female recipients) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories or Charles River Laboratories, respectively. Spleens from 8 B10.D2 mice were collected. CD4+ CD25− T-cell were isolated from pooled spleens using standard methodology known in the art. Purity of the T-cell population was evaluated by flow cytometry.\n\n\nNaïve C.B-17 SCID mice received 5×10\n5 \nCD4+ CD25− T-cells (isolated from spleens of B10.D2 mice) via intravenous injection on \nday\n 0. All mice were weighed at least five times per week and carefully observed for weight loss, which can be associated with colitis. In addition, a clinical colitis score [stool consistency and blood in stool] was taken at least one day per week. Mice were also carefully monitored at least five days per week and assigned a score for signs of psoriatic symptoms (hair loss, scratching, alopecia, etc).\n\n\nA rat anti-mouse IL-21 (mIL-21) antibody, a rat isotype control antibody, or vehicle (PBS) was administered to groups of mice beginning on \nday\n 0. The treatments were delivered as intraperitoneal injections, twice a week, with the antibodies being administered at 0.2 or 0.8 mg per mouse per dose. They could also be delivered using a similar dosing regimen or other route of administration. There were 9-10 mice per group in the anti-IL21 antibody groups, 6-7 mice per group in the isotype control antibody groups, and 10 mice per group in the PBS group. This dosing regimen is referred to as “prophylactic dosing”.\n\n\nIn a separate experiment, groups of mice dosed with the same antibodies and doses described above (10 mice per group) started their treatments on \nday\n 12 following cell transfer, which is approximately the day that the mice began showing signs of psoriasis and/or colitis. This dosing regimen is referred to as “therapeutic dosing”.\n\n\nAt the end of the study (day 45), colonic tissue was submitted for histological evidence of colitis and serum for analysis of cytokine and chemokine levels.\n\n\nResults of Prophylactic Dosing: Mice receiving the anti-m/L-21 antibody at both the 0.2 and 0.8 mg doses were characterized by significant (at least p<0.05 or better) reductions in body weight loss and significant reductions in psoriatic skin and colitis symptom throughout the experimental period compared to mice administered PBS or 0.2 mg isotype control monoclonal antibody. At the end of the study (day 45), mice treated with either dose of the mIL-21 antibody were at approximately 100% of their starting body weight, whereas PBS-treated mice had lost an average of 16% of their starting body weight and mice treated with an isotype control antibody had lost 10-15% of their starting body weight. At \nday\n 45, mice treated with either dose of the mIL-21 antibody had approximately 6.5-7-fold lower average colitis clinical scores and approximately 5-7 fold lower average psoriatic skin scores. Only 20% of mice treated with 0.2 mg anti-m/L-21 antibody developed psoriasis, which was mild, whereas none of the mice treated with the 0.8 mg dose developed any psoriatic skin symptoms. On the other hand, 100% of the PBS-treated mice developed psoriasis, with approximately 50% of these mice developing severe symptoms. At the end of the study, there was also a significant reduction in histologic indices of colitis (scored for intestinal inflammation, lesions, and architecture) in the anti-m/L-21 antibody treated mice compared to PBS- and 0.2 mg isotype-control treated mice.\n\n\nMice treated with anti-m/L-21 antibody had significantly lower serum IL-6, RANTES, TNF-α, and MIP-1β levels compared to PBS-treated mice, further supporting an anti-inflammatory role for anti-m/L-21 antibody.\n\n\nResults of Therapeutic Dosing: Mice receiving the anti-m/L-21 antibody at both the 0.2 and 0.8 mg doses, beginning from \nday\n 12 following T cell transfers, were characterized by reductions in body weight loss and significant reductions in colitis symptoms throughout the experimental period compared to mice administered the isotype control monoclonal antibody. At \nday\n 45, mice treated with either dose of the anti-m/L-21 antibody had approximately 3.5-4-fold lower average colitis clinical scores compared to isotype control antibody-treated mice. Mice treated with the 0.8 mg dose of anti-m/L-21 antibody had lower psoriasis scores than isotype control antibody- or PBS-treated mice.\n\n\nSummary: Taken together, these results indicate that in vivo administration of an anti-mIL-21 antibody was efficacious in reducing colitis and psoriasis onset and severity in a murine T cell transfer model, and suggest that anti-IL-21 antibodies may be efficacious in treating human inflammatory bowel disease and/or psoriasis.\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nContact Hypersensitivity Mouse Model\n\n\nContact hypersensitivity can be induced in mice using a variety of contact allergens including dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and oxazolone. Mice are sensitized topically with the allergen in a vehicle of acetone and olive oil and then challenged in the ear with the allergen in olive oil alone. Change in ear thickness is a measure of the immune response against the allergen. Anti-IL-21 antibodies are administered either at the sensitization phase (days 0-5) or during the challenge phase (days 5-6). Inhibition of ear thickness by antagonizing IL-21 indicates a role for IL-21 in inducing contact hypersensitivity.\n\n\nC57B1/6 mice are painted on the back with 0.5% DNFB in acetone:olive oil (4:1) or acetone:olive oil alone on \nday\n 0. On day 5, ear thickness of mice is measured using calipers and mice are challenged in the ears with olive oil alone (control) or 0.25% DNFB in olive oil by dropping a 25 μl solution onto the ear. Change in ear thickness is measured on day 6 and the inflammation calculated as a difference in ear thickness between day 5 and day 6. Groups of mice are injected i.p. with PBS or 10-100 μg anti-IL-21 antibodies on either days 0-5 or days 5-6.\n\n\nInhibition of ear thickness by anti-IL-21 antibodies demonstrates that anti-IL-21 antibodies can be useful in inhibiting contact hypersensitivity.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nEpitope Mapping\n\n\nA. Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange (HDx) Experiment\n\n\nIn an effort to identify the epitope regions of IL-21 recognized by neutralizing anti-IL-21 mAbs 362.78.1.44, 362.597.3, 366.328.10, 366.552.11 and the soluble hIL-21R/γc-Fc an immunoaffinity-based hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDx) method was applied followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Specifically, the purified mAbs were immobilized on CNBr-activated sepharose beads and exchanged into deuterium buffer. Deuterated IL-21 was bound to the immunoaffinity beads by incubation and the beads were washed with deuterated buffer to remove unbound proteins. The antigen-antibody complex was then subjected to PBS solution to initiate back-exchange to amide hydrogen on the unbound regions of IL-21. Deuterium hydrogen exchange was then quenched and IL-21 was eluted in low pH buffer, which was then subjected to proteolytic digestion by immobilized pepsin. Peptide mass maps were then generated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and compared with that of the control sample, generated from the free state of IL-21, which was exchanged back to amide hydrogen from the deuterated IL-21 by dilution with PBS solution. \nFIG. 3\n shows expanded mass spectra of pepsin-digested peptides of both the free-state of IL-21 (\nFIGS. 3A and 3C\n) and the antibody-bound IL-21 (\nFIGS. 3B and 3D\n). As indicated in \nFIG. 3A\n, overlapping peptide isotope were assigned to corresponding peptides EKKPPKEF (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 136) (m/z, 1002.5619 Da) and LERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 137 to 144) (m/z, 1005.6091 Da) of the free-state of IL-21 with theoretical peptide masses within 10 ppm mass accuracy. A small amount of residual deuterated peptide was observed around m/z, 1002.5619 Da, due to incomplete amide hydrogen exchange.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3B\n is a spectrum of the same mass range of \nFIG. 3A\n showing the two overlapping peptide isotope envelopes having monoisotope ions at 1014.49 m/z and 1015.00 m/z. Because two peptide ions were clustered around the same mass range, it was difficult to assign each peptide identity between the two ions. However, tandem mass spectrometry data of the peptide ions of \nFIGS. 3A\n and B showed that they had identical peptide fragmentation patterns (data not shown). Although there was a small percentage of non-deuterated peptide detected from the sample obtained from the antigen-antibody complex, the majority of the peptide ions retained deuterium and shifted to the higher mass region by virtue of limited solvent accessibility to the antibody/antigen binding regions, indicating that the mAb binding site likely contains the region EKKPPKEFLERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 144).\n\n\nAnother pepsin-digested peptide from both the free-state of IL-21 and the antigen-antibody complex was observed as shown in \nFIGS. 3C\n and D and it was identified as KSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 162) (m/z, 2519.2451) based on the theoretical mass of pepsin-digested peptide fragment of IL-21. As shown in \nFIG. 3D\n, comparing the mass shift of this 22-amino acid residue peptide (Amass=9.0 Da) with the mass shift of those two upstream residues (\nFIG. 2B\n, EKKPPKEF (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 136) and LERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 137-144), this region was only marginally protected upon binding of the mAb, indicating that only a portion of this peptide may be involved in binding to the mAb. In fact this peptide sequence is the C-terminal tail and it contains four overlapping amino acid residues with the peptide (LERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 137 to 144), which appeared to be significantly protected by the mAb. Based on these mass spectrometric measurements of deuterium retention, we estimated that the IL-21 epitope for binding of the mAb EKKPPKEFLERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 144) and the upstream sequence of KSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 162).\n\n\nB. Lysine Labeling Protection Experiment\n\n\nUsing the HDx assay, the IL-21 mAb binding epitope region was estimated and it was observed that five lysine residues (from a total of 12 lysine residues in IL-21) reside in the estimated binding epitope region. Since lysine residues are most likely to be present at solvent accessible regions of proteins due to their charged characteristic, lysine appears to be an ideal choice for selective chemical modification for a parallel determination of the antigen epitope region. The concept behind the chemical modification strategy is that the protection of lysine modification in an antigen in the presence and absence of antibody correlates to its binding epitope (Scholten et al., \nJ. Amer. Soc. Mass Spectr. \n17: 983-994, 2006). Therefore, for further characterization of the epitope region and for the determination of those lysine residues involved in the binding of the mAb, selective acetylation on lysine residues was performed in both the affinity-bound and free states of IL-21. The site of lysine modification/protection was determined by whole mass and peptide mapping analyses using MALDI-TOF and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry.\n\n\nScholten et al., (Scholten et al., \nJ. Amer. Soc. Mass Spectr. \n17: 983-994, 2006) investigated the molar ratio between the acetylation reagent (NHS-acetate) and an antigen for the full acetylation of solvent accessible lysine residues and found that the labeling was effective at 250-fold molar excess of the reagent in 3 min reaction. To determine the binding epitope, the same labeling reaction condition was employed for both the free state IL-21 and the affinity bound IL-21 with several neutralizing IL-21 mAbs, as well as the IL-21 heterodimeric receptor protein (IL-21R/γc-Fc). With the given labeling reaction condition, different solvent accessibility of lysine residues of the IL-21 alone and the affinity-bound IL-21 gave rise to the distribution of lysine acetylation (acetyl occupancy) on the IL-21 molecule. The number of protected lysine residues on the affinity-bound IL-21 was compared to the IL-21 alone by the most intense ion. Spectral alignment based on the most intense ions clearly showed that the number of lysine acetylations on the antigens isolated from different immune complexes is varied. It was evident that the lysine labeling reagent was less accessible into the affinity-bound IL-21. Hence, the acetylation was reduced by the binding of the antigen to the antibody.\n\n\nThe acetylation protected lysines, which may be involved in the binding of the mAb, were further probed by protease digestion, and followed by peptide mass mapping analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Since covalently modified lysine residues are resistant to tryptic digestion, pepsin proteolytic enzyme was used to generate more mass spectrometry-detectable peptides to study the lysine modification in more detail. The modification of individual peptides using single peptide ion chromatography was investigated. As shown in \nFIG. 4\n, selected ion chromatograms were generated from both the control (IL-21 alone) and the test samples (affinity bound IL-21 molecules) to determine acetylated and non-acetylated lysine residues. \nFIG. 4A\n is a selected ion chromatogram of a proteolytic peptide eluting at 56.22 min in the given chromatographic condition and the monoisotope peptide ion mass was at 662.9 Da, which appeared to be in a triply charged state (Δm=0.3 Da) as indicated in the embedded mass spectrum. Identification of this peptide in a triply charged state as the lysine acetylated pepsin-digested peptide fragment, TCPSCDSYEKKPPKEF (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 119 to 136) (m/z, 1986 Da) was made, whereas the non-acetylated peptide mass is 1860 Da (m/z). The mass difference (acetylated peptide/non-acetylated peptide) was 126 Da, indicating that all three lysine residues in this peptide were acetylated in the free-state of IL-21. However, a selected ion chromatogram of the affinity bound IL-21 showed no trace of the peptide (\nFIG. 4B\n) indicating that the three lysine residues were completely protected by the IL-21 antibody binding.\n\n\nAn additional pepsin-digested peptide (KSLLQKMI (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 148) was found to be protected upon binding of IL-21 mAb (\nFIGS. 4C and 4D\n). Its monoisotopic ion was at 509 Da (m/z) as a doubly charged ion (Δm=0.5 Da) and the mass difference (acetylated peptide/non-acetylated peptide) was 42 Da, indicating that only one of the two lysine residues in this peptide was protected. Earlier H/D exchange experiments indicated that the lysine upstream of the C-terminal tail of the peptide sequence, KSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 162), was most likely protected by the antibody binding. Thus it is most likely that K113 instead of K119 is involved in the antibody binding.\n\n\nFour lysine residues (K102, K103, K106 and K113) were protected from acetylation by clones 362.78.1.44 and 362.597.3 binding and they were located within the estimated IL-21 mAb binding epitope region as determined from the HDx assay. Collectively, the acetylation protection assay provided the involvement of specific lysine residues in the antigen-antibody interaction and further confirmed the epitope sequence estimated from the HDx assay.\n\n\n17C.—Comparison of IL-21 Amino Acid Sequences from Various Species\n\n\nTo better understand the species cross-reactivity results in Examples 3 and 9, in light of the defined epitopes on IL-21 bound by the IL-21 mAbs (Example 17A and B), amino acid sequences were obtained and compared for IL-21 across multiple species (Table 13). The overall human sequence was more than 96% identical to cynomolgus and rhesus monkey sequences, while only 61-65% identical to the rodent IL-21 sequences. Notably, the discontinuous epitope bound by clones 362.78.1.44 and 362.597.3 as described in Example 17 (underlined in Table 13) is identical in human, cynomolgus and rhesus monkey IL-21, while the rat IL-21 sequence differs from human IL-21 in 6 residues in these regions, and the mouse IL-21 sequence differs by 7 residues.\n\n\nTable 13: IL-21 amino acid sequence alignment for human, cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey, rat and mouse IL-21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu IL-21\n\n\nMRSSPGNMERIVICLMVIFLGTLVHKSSS QGQDRHMIRMRQLID\nIVDQLKNYVNDLV\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynoIL-21\n\n\nMRSSPGNMERIVICLMVIFLGTLVHKSSS QGQDRHMIRMRQLIDIVDQLKNYVNDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhesusIL-21\n\n\nMRSSPGNMERIVICLMVIFLGTLVHKSSS QGQDRHMIRMRQLIDIVDQLKNYVNDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat IL-21\n\n\n       MERTLVCLILIFLGTVAHKSSP QRPDHLLIRLRHLMDIVEQLKIYENDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuIL-21\n\n\n       MERTLVCLVVIFLGTVAHKSSP QGPDRLLIRLRHLIDIVEQLKIYENDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu\n\n\nPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAFSCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINVSIKKLKRKPP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyno\n\n\nPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAISCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINLSIKKLKRKSP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRh\n\n\nPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAISCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINLSIKKLKRKSP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat\n\n\nPELLTAPQDVKGQCEHEAFACFQKAKLKPSNTGNNKTFINDLLAQLRRRLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\n\n\nPELLSAPQDVKGHCEHAAFACFQKAKLKPSNPGNNKTFIIDLVAQLRRRLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu\n\n\nSTNAGRRQKHRLTCPSCDSY\nEKKPPKEFLERFKSLL\nQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyno\n\n\nSTGAERRQKHRLTCPSCDSYEKKPPKEFLERFKSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRh\n\n\nSTGAERRQKHRLTCPSCDSYEKKPPKEFLERFKSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat\n\n\nAKRTGNKQRHMAKCPSCDLYEKKTPKEFLERLKWLLQKMIHQHLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\n\n\nARRGGKKQKHIAKCPSCDSYEKRTPKEFLERLKWLLQKMIHQHLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:2; IL-21; mouse is shown as SEQ ID NO: 11; IL-21 cynomylous is shown as SEQ ID NO:9; IL-21 rhesus is shown as SEQ ID NO:9; IL-21 rat is shown as SEQ ID NO:97.\n\n\nThe discontinuous epitope determined for two highly related anti-hIL-21 mAbs 362.78.1 and 362.597.3 is underlined above.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nAnti-Idiotype Monoclonal Antibodies to 362.78-CHO for Use in Pre-Clinical and Clinical Immunoassays\n\n\nAnti-idiotype mAbs were generated specific for 362.78-CHO for application in pre-clinical and clinical immunoassays, such that potential anti-362.78-CHO antibody responses in individuals treated with this therapeutic anti-IL-21 mAb can be specifically measured.\n\n\nTo distinguish between the immunogen (362.78-CHO), which is itself an antibody, and the anti-idiotype antibodies in this Example, the immunogen will be designated as Ab1 and an anti-idiotype antibody will be designated as Ab2. An anti-idiotypic antibody should inhibit (neutralize) binding of the Ab1 to its antigen (IL-21). However, it should be noted that in the process, anti-Ab1 antibodies will be generated that are not anti-idiotypic. By definition, these will be anti-362.78-CHO binding, non-neutralizing antibodies and may also be of use in the pre-clinical and clinical immunoassays.\n\n\nMethods: To immunize mice with 362.78-CHO, five 6 to 8 week old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were immunized with 362.78-CHO. The mice were initially immunized by subcutaneous injection with ˜50 μg of purified, 362.78-CHO (Lot# A2125F) in combination with Emulsigen®-P adjuvant (MVP Laboratories INC, Omaha, Nebr.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Following the initial immunization, each of the mice received an additional 50 μg of 362.78-CHO in Emulsigen®-P adjuvant via the subcutaneous route every two weeks over a six week period. Seven days after the third and fourth immunizations the mice were bled via the retro orbital plexus and the serum was separated from the blood for analysis of its ability to bind to 362.78-CHO.\n\n\nSelection of Fusion Animal Using Both a Capture Assay and a Neutralization Assay:\n\n\nCapture Assay: The ability of mouse anti-362.78-CHO (Ab2, anti-idiotype) antibodies in the antisera to bind to 362.78-CHO (Ab1, produced in CHO cells, lot # E10569) was assessed using a capture style ELISA assay. In this assay, wells of 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates were first coated with 100 μL/well of goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL in Coating Buffer (0.1M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.6). Plates were incubated overnight at 4° C. after which unbound antibody was aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween defined as 0.137M NaCl, 0.0022M KCl, 0.0067M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.0020M KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.05% v/\nw polysorbate\n 20, pH 7.2). Wells were blocked with 200 μL/well of Blocking Buffer (PBS-Tween plus 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT), aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of PBS-Tween. Wells were incubated with 362.78-CHO (Ab1, ZGI produced in CHO cells, lot # E10569) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (in 1% BSA in PBS-Tween). After 1 hour incubation at RT, wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Serial 10-fold dilutions (in 1% BSA in PBS-Tween) of the antisera (Ab2) were prepared beginning with an initial dilution of 1:1000 and ranging to 1:1,000,000. Duplicate samples of each dilution were then transferred to the assay plate, 100 μL/well. Normal mouse sera served as a negative control. Following a 1 hour incubation at RT, the wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Goat anti-mouse IgG, Fc specific, HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:5000 was then added to the wells, 100 μL/well. Following a 1 hour incubation at RT, unbound detection antibody was aspirated from the wells and the plates washed twice. After the aspiration, 100 μL/well of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) was added to each well and the plates incubated for 1 minutes at RT. Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μL/well of Stop Reagent (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) and the absorbance values of the wells read on a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX 340 instrument at 450 nm.\n\n\nNeutralization Assay: The ability of mouse anti-362.78-CHO anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) in the antisera to inhibit (neutralize) the binding activity of 362.78-CHO (Ab1) was assessed using a plate based neutralization assay. In this assay, wells of 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates were first coated with 100 μL/well of human IL-21 ligand (lot # A1207F) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL in Coating Buffer (0.1M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.6). Plates were incubated overnight at 4° C., after which unbound ligand was aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween defined as 0.137M NaCl, 0.0022M KCl, 0.0067M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.0020M KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.05% v/\nw polysorbate\n 20, pH 7.2). Wells were blocked with 200 μL/well of Blocking Buffer (PBS-Tween plus 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 hour, after which the plates were washed twice with Wash Buffer. Serial 10-fold dilutions (in 1% BSA in PBS-Tween) of the antisera (Ab2) were prepared beginning with an initial dilution of 1:100 and ranging to 1:100,000. Normal mouse sera served as a negative control. Duplicate samples of each dilution were then transferred to a 96-well dilution plate, 100 μL/well. Ab1 was added as a 2× solution, 100 μL/well. Following a 45 minute incubation at RT, 100 μL/well was transferred to the assay plate after the Blocking Buffer was aspirated. Following a 1 hour incubation at RT, the wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled Goat anti Human IgG, Fc specific, HRP conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) at a dilution of 1:5000 was then added to each well, 100 μL/well, and the plates incubated at RT for 1 hour. After removal of unbound detection antibody, the plates were washed twice, 100 μL/well of tetra methyl benzidine (TMB) (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) added to each well and the plates incubated for 2 minutes at RT. Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μL/well of Stop Reagent (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) and the absorbance values of the wells read on a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX 340 instrument at 450 nm.\n\n\nFusion: Two mice with the highest anti-362.78-CHO neutralization titers were immunized a final time with approximately 50 μg of 362.78-CHO (Ab1) in PBS without adjuvant via subcutaneous injection. Four days later, the spleen and lymph nodes of these mice were harvested. Electrofusion was performed using standard methods known in the art to fuse lymphocytes with mouse myeloma P3-X63-Ag8.653 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1580) at a 1:1 lymphocyte-myeloma ratio, using the Cyto-pulse CEEF-50 apparatus (Cyto Pulse Sciences Inc., Glen Burnie, Md.). The fusion mixture was distributed into 96-well flat-bottomed plates. Wells of the fusion plates were fed three times with a 70% replacement of hybridoma growth medium (IMDM with 1×L-glutamine (100×), 1× Penicillin-Streptomycin (100×), all from Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., 10% Fetalclonel serum, non-heat inactivated (HyClone, Logan, Utah), 10% Hybridoma Cloning Factor (BM Condimed H1 Roche Diagnostic, Indianapolis, Ind.), 1×HAT supplement (50×, Gibco Invitrogen). Wells were assayed ten days after plating of the fusion.\n\n\nSelection of Master Wells: The 96-well fusion plates were screened for the presence of mouse anti-362.78-CHO idiotype antibodies using a capture style ELISA as described above except that hybridoma supernatants were tested undiluted from the culture plates. Hybridoma cells of positive wells were successfully expanded into culture in 24-well plates. When the density of the 24-well cultures was approximately 4-6×10\n5 \ncells/mL, the supernatant (approximately 1.5 mL) was individually collected and stored for each well and the cells from each well cryopreserved. Freezing medium consisted of 90\n% Fetalclone\n 1 serum and 10% DMSO. Each of the 24-well supernatants was reanalyzed in both the capture ELISA and plate based neutralization ELISA assay described above. Results indicated that following expansion, all of the master well supernatants had retained their ability to recognize 362.78-CHO antibody (Ab1) in solution. Seven of the master well supernatants retained their ability to neutralize the binding of Ab1 to human IL-21 ligand.\n\n\nCloning: Cells from 5 master wells were chosen according to their neutralizing activity and cloned in hybridoma growth medium supplemented with 1×HT (100×, Gibco Invitrogen) in order to isolate a clonal hybridoma producing the neutralizing mAb of interest. Cells were cloned in 96-well microtiter cell culture plates using a standard low-density dilution (less than 1 cell per well) approach and monoclonality was assessed by microscopic examination of wells for a single foci of growth prior to assay. Six days post-plating, all plates were screened by the neutralization ELISA for anti-362.78-CHO anti-idiotype inhibiting antibodies. Hybridoma cells from positive wells were successfully expanded into 24-well plates.\n\n\nSelection of First Round Clones: Supernatants from approximately 6 wells of each cloned hybridoma line that were positive for specific mAb and originated from wells with only a single colony of hybridoma growth were collected from each cloning set and rescreened at various dilutions in the neutralization ELISA to identify a best neutralizing mAb producing clone. When the density of a best clone of the 24-well cultures were approximately 4-6×10\n5 \ncells/mL, the supernatant was individually collected and stored for each well and the cells from each well cryopreserved.\n\n\nSummary: mouse monoclonal antibodies (Ab2) reactive against the recombinantly expressed 362.78-CHO antibody (Ab1) were generated and exhibit neutralizing activity capable of blocking the binding of 362.78-CHO antibody to human IL-21. These antibodies can be used as reagents in pre-clinical and clinical immunoassays.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nBinding of Native Intracellular Human and Cynomolgus Monkey IL-21 (But Not Mouse or Rat IL-21) by IL-21 mAb 362.78.1.44\n\n\nThe neutralizing anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies described herein were generated from transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes and immunized with recombinant human IL-21 (see Example 1). It was important to confirm that the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind and neutralize native human IL-21 in addition to the recombinant form of the IL-21. Additionally, in order to support preclinical toxicology studies, it is helpful to understand the binding capacity of the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 to native IL-21 in a variety of species. In order to test this, one approach is to label IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 with a fluorescent dye and use it to detect intracellular IL-21 in activated T cells by flow cytometry. In this study, freshly isolated human and cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leukocytes as well as rat and mouse splenocytes were activated in vitro with PMA and ionomycin for 24 hours to induce IL-21 production. Cells were harvested, fixed, permeabilized and stained for expression of CD3 or CD4 (to define helper T cell populations) and IL-21 using the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with ALEXA FLUOR-647 (AF-647), and compared to the staining intensity induced by an isotype-matched control antibody. A positive signal in this assay, above that observed for the isotype control mAb, demonstrates specific IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 binding to endogenous IL-21 in the test species, though it is not an indicator of IL-21 neutralizing activity. Further studies are required to demonstrate IL-21 neutralization in a species that tests positive for IL-21 binding with the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 (see Example 20).\n\n\nIsolation of human PBMC: 100 mL peripheral blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics) in green top heparin Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.). Blood was diluted with 100 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were distributed into 50 mL conical tubes. 14 mL of room temperature Ficoll/Paque PLUS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was removed and washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with supplemental Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, Sodium Pyruvate, 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol, all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques.\n\n\nIsolation of cynomolgus monkey PBMC: 40 mL peripheral blood was collected in green-top heparin Vacutainer blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences) from a cynomolgus monkey housed at the University of Washington in Seattle. Blood was diluted with 40 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were distributed into 50 mL conical tubes. Fourteen mL of room temperature Ficoll/Paque PLUS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 25 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was removed and washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with supplemental Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, Sodium Pyruvate, 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol). Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques.\n\n\nIsolation of murine and rat splenocytes: Both rat and mouse splenocytes were prepared according to the following protocol. A freshly collected spleen was gently disrupted to a single cell suspension using the ends of two frosted glass slides. Cells were then passed through a 70-μM nylon mesh filter to remove clumps. Red blood cells were lysed by resuspending the cell pellet in 2 mL ACK lysis buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature. This reaction was stopped by the addition of assay media, the cells were then centrifuged (1200 RPM for 5 minutes), resuspended and passed over another nylon mesh filter to remove debris. Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques.\n\n\nOvernight activation of cells with PMA and ionomycin: Cells from all species were resuspended at 2.0×10e6 cells per mL. One mL of cells was then plated with or without the addition of 20 ng/mL PMA and 200 ng/mL ionomycin into a 24-well plate and incubated at 37° C. for 20 hours in a humidified 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator. After 20 hours, 1.0 μL of GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen) was added to each well and the cells were incubated an additional four hours.\n\n\nCell harvest and surface stain: Following the 24 hour incubation described above, cells were harvested, washed with cold FACS buffer and plated at 2.0×105-5.0×10e5 cells per well in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Cells were then stained with 1 μg/mL of one or more of the following antibodies, as appropriate: anti-murine CD4-PE, anti-rat CD3-PE, anti-rat B220-PE, or anti-monkey CD4-PE, or anti-human CD4-PE for 20 minutes on ice. Cells were then washed two times in PBS in preparation for fixation.\n\n\nCell fixation and permeabilization: To fix cells, each cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of 2% paraformaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Cells were then centrifuged (5 minutes at 1200 rpm) and the supernatants aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in a permeabilization buffer [PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin (Calbiochem) and 0.5% BSA (Sigma)] for 10 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\nIntracellular stain: Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were stained with ˜1 g/mL of one of the following labeled antibodies: anti-mouse IL-21-AF647, anti-human IL-21 clone 362.78.1.44-AF647 (both produced at ZymoGenetics) or a comparator anti-human IL-21-AF647 antibody from BD Pharmingen. Cells were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (HBSS supplemented with 1% BSA, 2% Human AB serum and 0.05% HEPES)\n\n\nData acquisition and analysis: Upon completion of staining and washing, cells were resuspended in 400 μL FACS buffer and data were collected using a FACS Calibur (BD Pharmingen) running CellQuest software. Data were analyzed using FCS Express data analysis software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, Calif.).\n\n\nResults: Detection of human IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated human T cells: While only 0.015% of the CD3+ T cells stained positive using the isotype control, approximately 9% of the CD4+ T cells stained positive for IL-21 using the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with AF-647. The same fraction of IL-21+ cells was detected using the commercially available IL-21 mAb from eBiosciences. This demonstrates that the IL-21 mAb can bind endogenously produced IL-21 in human CD4+ T cells.\n\n\nDetection of cynomolgus monkey IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells: Approximately 3.6% of the CD3+ cyno T cells stained positive for IL-21 using the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with AF-647, compared to 0.1% positive using the isotype control. This number is higher than that detected using a commercially available anti-human IL-21 mAb from eBiosciences. This discrepancy may be due to a weaker binding affinity of the eBiosciences antibody for cynomolgus IL-21. These results demonstrate that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind endogenously produced IL-21 in cynomolgus monkey CD3+ T cells.\n\n\nDetection of murine IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated splenocytes: Using a rat anti-murine IL-21 monoclonal antibody generated at ZymoGenetics as a positive control, approximately 13.5% of the activated mouse CD4+ T cells were positive for IL-21. However, as predicted from western blots and neutralizing bioactivity assays showing that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 does not bind or neutralize mouse IL-21 (see Examples 3 and 9), the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with AF647 did not detect any IL-21-positive cells. This further demonstrates that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 does not bind to murine IL-21.\n\n\nDetection of rat IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated splenocytes: Rat splenocytes were stimulated overnight in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. These stimulation conditions were sufficient to produce IL-21 positive T cells in human, cynomolgus monkey and murine T cells. In this experiment, neither the anti-mouse IL-21 mAb nor the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 detected any cells that were positive for IL-21. However, because there was no positive control in this experiment, this negative result does not conclusively eliminate the possibility that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind to rat IL-21. However, these data, considered along with the lack of neutralization of rat IL-21 bioactivity by the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 in other assays (see Example 9), does strongly suggest that this mAb probably does not bind rat IL-21.\n\n\nConclusion: The IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 described herein clearly binds to the native human and cynomolgus monkey forms of the IL-21 protein but not to murine or rat IL-21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-human IL-21\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 Positive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nIsotype control\n\n\nmAb (clone 78)\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\n\n0.015% of CD3+ T cells\n\n\n9% of CD3+ T cells were\n\n\n10% of CD3+ T cells were IL-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nstained positive with an\n\n\nIL-21+\n\n\n21+ (eBiosciences αIL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhIgG4-AF647 control\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb*)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynomolgus\n\n\n0.1% of CD3+ T cells\n\n\n3.6% of CD3+ T cells were\n\n\n0.2% of CD3+ T cells were\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonkey\n\n\nstained positive with an\n\n\nIL-21+\n\n\nIL-21+*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhIgG4-AF647 control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nNo isotype control used\n\n\nNone detected\n\n\n13.5% of CD4+ T cells were\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat\n\n\nNo isotype control used\n\n\nNone detected\n\n\nNot available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*(this mAb may not bind strongly to cyno IL-21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\nBinding and Neutralization of Native Human IL-21 Bioactivity by Clone 362.78.1.44\n\n\nThe neutralizing anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies (IL-21 mAb) described herein were generated from transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes and immunized with recombinant human IL-21 (see Example 1). It was important to confirm that the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind and neutralize native human IL-21 in addition to the recombinant form of IL-21. To demonstrate neutralization of native IL-21, the Baf3/IL-21R pSTAT cell-based assay previously described (see Example 7) was utilized and activated CD4+ T cell conditioned media samples were used as the source of native IL-21. In this experiment, T cell conditioned media samples were preincubated with varying amounts of IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 and the level of IL-21-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in the Baf3/hIL-21R transfectants was then measured. Neutralization of native IL-21 was demonstrated using activated T cell conditioned media samples from four separate healthy human donors.\n\n\nIsolation of human PBMC and generation of T cell conditioned media samples: 100 mL of peripheral blood was collected from 4 healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics) in green top heparin Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.). Blood was then diluted with 100 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were distributed into 50 mL conical tubes. 14 mL of room temperature Ficoll/Paque PLUS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was removed and washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with supplemental Penicillin/Streptinomycin, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, Sodium Pyruvate, 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol, all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques. T cells were negatively selected using a Human CD4+ T Cell Selection Kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, Calif.) following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer. Using standard immunophenotyping techniques, the CD4+ T cells were subsequently determined to be >95% pure by flow cytometry. T cells were then incubated for three days at 5×10e5 cells per well in a 24-well plate pre-coated with 5.0 μg/mL anti-CD3 antibody in Th1 skewing media containing 5.0 μg/mL anti-IFNγ, 1.0 μg/mL anti-CD28 (all from Becton Dickinson) and 10 ng/mL recombinant IL-12 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). After three days, cells were washed, re-plated in media containing 25 ng/mL PMA and 500 ng/mL ionomycin and incubated for five hours at 37° C. After five hours, conditioned media samples were harvested and frozen and stored at −80° C. until day of experiment.\n\n\nTo estimate the approximate IL-21 concentration in the T cell conditioned media samples, 1:4 serial dilutions were prepared and tested for induction of STAT3 phosphorylation in the Baf3/hIL-21R transfectants. Following the 10 minute pSTAT3 bioassay protocol outlined in Example 7, the relative concentration of IL-21 in each conditioned media sample was estimated by comparing the level of pSTAT3 to that generated using a titration of recombinant IL-21. Using these data, the concentration of IL-21 in each of the four conditioned media samples was determined to be between 5.0 and 10.0 ng/mL.\n\n\nTo demonstrate neutralization of native IL-21-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, 1:10 dilutions (final IL-21 concentrations between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL) of the four T cell conditioned media samples were preincubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. with a 1:4 serial dilution of IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44. The concentration of clone 362.78.1.44 ranged from 0.4 to 400 ng/mL. After 30 minutes, the conditioned media+IL-21 mAb samples were transferred to the Baf3/hIL-21R cell plate and incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 37° C. After 10 minutes, the reactions were stopped with cold wash buffer, cells lysed and amount of pSTAT3 measured using the method described in Example 7.\n\n\nIn all four conditioned media samples, the clone 362.78.1.44 IL-21 mAb effectively neutralized IL-21 activity (data summarized in Table 15). These data clearly demonstrate effective binding to and neutralization of native human IL-21 by clone 362.78.1.44.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralization of native IL-21 by IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 mAb Conc.\n\n\npSTAT3 induction (fold over background)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ng/mL)\n\n\n \nDonor\n 1\n\n\n \nDonor\n 2\n\n\n \nDonor\n 3\n\n\nDonor 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n69.49\n\n\n56.32\n\n\n61.11\n\n\n62.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n70.84\n\n\n61.73\n\n\n68.24\n\n\n65.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.25\n\n\n70.76\n\n\n10.46\n\n\n7.51\n\n\n60.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n1.62\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n168\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n1.59\n\n\n1.30\n\n\n1.14\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\n21A. Pilot Toxicity Study with IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nThe epitope specificity of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO is shared by humans, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (see Examples 17 and 17b), therefore tolerability and toxicity of IL-21 mAb was tested in cynomolgus monkeys, a relevant species for safety assessment.\n\n\nCynomolgus monkeys were treated with a single injection of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO and monitored for clinical signs for 4 to 8 weeks following treatment. The IL-21 mAb was delivered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection at doses of 5 or 100 mg/kg. No clinical signs were observed. No meaningful changes in body weight or coagulation were observed. No changes in serum chemistry or hematology attributable to drug toxicity were observed. The single treatment with IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO at 5 or 100 mg/kg was well tolerated by all of the animals.\n\n\nNecropsy was performed on the high-dose (100 mg/kg) animals. No gross anatomic changes were observed. Histopathology analysis of the high-dose animals showed minimal lymphoid hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis of lymphoid tissues showed a moderate increase in follicle size and in follicle-associated cell types. These changes could relate to the pharmacological activity of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO, since IL-21 is known to directly affect the development and egress of B cells from lymphoid follicles and to support class switch, affinity maturation and plasma cell development.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic behavior and bioavailability of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was monitored in a single dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. Eight male cynomolgus monkeys were treated with IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO. Three were treated by subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg and three were treated by intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg. Two were treated by intravenous injection of 100 mg/kg. Serum samples were taken for analysis of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO levels during four weeks following treatment for the 100 mg/kg group and during eight weeks following treatment for the two 5 mg/kg groups. Noncompartmental analysis of pharmacokinetic profiles showed that exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner with intravenous administration of 5 or 100 mg/kg IL-21 mAb. Bioavailability of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was approximately 50% following subcutaneous administration. The estimated terminal half-life for IL-21 mAb was 10-14 days. The estimated terminal half-life of IL-21 mAb *insert: 362.78-CHO in cynomolgus monkeys was 10-14 days.\n\n\n21B. Pilot Pharmacology Study with 362.78-CHO in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nThe epitope specificity of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO is shared by humans, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (see Examples 17 and 17b), therefore in vivo pharmacology of IL-21 mAb was tested in cynomolgus monkeys, a relevant species for pharmacodynamic assessment.\n\n\nCynomolgus monkeys were treated with a single injection of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO and monitored for clinical signs for 4 to 8 weeks following treatment. The IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was delivered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection at doses of 5 or 100 mg/kg. All animals were monitored for changes in peripheral blood leukocyte composition by flow cytometry. No treatment-related changes in monocyte or B cell concentration, and no changes in T cell CD4 and CD8 subsets, nor in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells, were observed. A reduction in the NK cell concentration was observed following IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO administration. In all treatment groups, peripheral blood NK cells were decreased at 24 h post-treatment, relative to the baseline values. In five of the eight animals, NK levels remained below 60% of the baseline value for at least two weeks. A confirmatory study with adequate controls for handling stress and other sources of variability in peripheral blood NK cell concentration will be required to confirm this observation.\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\nAnti-mIL-21 Antibody Decreases Disease Incidence and Progression in Mouse Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) Model\n\n\nMouse Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) Model:\n\n\nThere are several animal models for rheumatoid arthritis known in the art. For example, in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, mice develop chronic inflammatory arthritis that closely resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. Since CIA shares similar immunological and pathological features with RA, this makes it an ideal model for screening potential human anti-inflammatory compounds. The CIA model is a well-known model in mice that depends on both an immune response, and an inflammatory response, in order to occur. The immune response comprises the interaction of B-cells and CD4+ T-cells in response to collagen, which is given as antigen, and leads to the production of anti-collagen antibodies. The inflammatory phase is the result of tissue responses from mediators of inflammation, as a consequence of some of these antibodies cross-reacting to the mouse's native collagen and activating the complement cascade. An advantage in using the CIA model is that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis are known. The relevant T-cell and B-cell epitopes on type II collagen have been identified, and various immunological (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity and anti-collagen antibody) and inflammatory (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes) parameters relating to immune-mediated arthritis have been determined, and can thus be used to assess test compound efficacy in the CIA model (Wooley, \nCurr. Opin. Rheum. \n3:407-20, 1999; Williams et al., \nImmunol. \n89:9784-788, 1992; Myers et al., \nLife Sci. \n61:1861-78, 1997; and Wang et al., \nImmunol. \n92:8955-959, 1995). The potential efficacy of a rat anti-mouse IL-21 mAb produced at ZymoGenetics was tested in the CIA model, as described below.\n\n\nTen-week old male DBA/1J mice (Jackson Labs) were used for therapeutic dosing (i.e. as mice get established disease). On day −21, all animals were given an intradermal tail injection of 100 microliters of 1 mg/mL chick Type II collagen formulated in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (prepared by Chondrex, Redmond, Wash.), and three weeks later on \nDay\n 0 they were given the same injection except prepared in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. An anti-IL-21 antibody or vehicle (PBS) was administered as an intraperitoneal injection every other day for a total of 6 doses as soon as a mouse developed established disease. Mice (n=7 per treatment) received either 0.15 mg of an anti-IL-21 antibody per animal per dose, or the vehicle control, PBS (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Animals began to show symptoms of arthritis following the second collagen injection, with most animals developing inflammation within 1-2 weeks. The extent of disease was evaluated in each paw by using a caliper to measure paw thickness, and by assigning a clinical score (0-3) to each paw (see below).\n\n\nMonitoring Disease:\n\n\nAnimals can begin to show signs of paw inflammation soon after the second collagen injection, and some animals may even begin to have signs of toe inflammation prior to the second collagen injection. Most animals develop arthritis within 1-2 weeks of the boost injection, but some may require a longer period of time. Incidence of disease in this model is typically 90-100%, and 0-5 non-responders (determined after 6 weeks of observation) are typically seen in a study using 60 animals. Since this study only included mice with established disease, mice that did not develop arthritis were not used. Note that as inflammation begins, a common transient occurrence of variable low-grade paw or toe inflammation can occur. For this reason, an animal was not considered to have established disease until marked, persistent paw swelling had developed.\n\n\nAll animals were observed daily to assess the status of the disease in their paws, which was done by assigning a qualitative clinical score to each of the paws. Every day, each animal had its 4 paws scored according to its state of clinical disease. To determine the clinical score, the paw can be thought of as having 3 zones, the toes, the paw itself (manus or pes), and the wrist or ankle joint. The extent and severity of the inflammation relative to these zones was taken into account including: observation of each toe for swelling; torn nails or redness of toes; notation of any evidence of edema or redness in any of the paws; notation of any loss of fine anatomic demarcation of tendons or bones; evaluation of the wrist or ankle for any edema or redness; and notation if the inflammation extends proximally up the leg. A paw score of 1, 2, or 3 was based first on the overall impression of severity, and second on how many zones were involved. The scale used for clinical scoring is shown below.\n\n\nClinical Score:\n\n\n0=Normal\n\n\n0.5=One or more toes involved, but only the toes are inflamed\n\n\n1=mild inflammation involving the paw (1 zone), and may include a toe or toes\n\n\n2=moderate inflammation in the paw and may include some of the toes and/or the wrist/ankle (2 zones)\n\n\n3=severe inflammation in the paw, wrist/ankle, and some or all of the toes (3 zones)\n\n\nEstablished disease was defined as a qualitative score of paw inflammation ranking 1 or more, that persisted for two days in a row. Once established disease was present, the date was recorded and designated as that animal's first day with “established disease”.\n\n\nMice receiving an anti-m/L-21 antibody were characterized by a reductions in paw swelling over the course of the experiment and had an approximately 25% lower average arthritis score compared to mice receiving PBS. These results indicate that an anti-m/L-21 antibody reduced paw swelling and disease progression associated with this model of arthritis and suggest that an anti-IL-21 antibody may be efficacious in the treatment of human arthritis.\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\nExpression of IL-21R in Human Psoriatic Skin Samples\n\n\nExpression of IL-21R is generally limited to cells of hematopoietic origin. However, in settings of inflammatory disease, IL-21R expression on non-hematopoietic cells may provide a direct stimulus to cell types that mediate the functional changes in the affected tissues. In psoriasis, keratinocyte growth is dysregulated, with psoriaform epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant terminal differentiation, and incomplete development of the stratum corneum. The IL-21 produced by infiltrating Th1 and Th17 cells in psoriatic skin could promote functional changes in keratinocytes, including cell proliferation, production of chemokines, and altered differentiation. The presence of IL-21R on keratinocytes in psoriatic skin lesions was therefore investigated.\n\n\nMethods: Immunohistochemistry analysis of 18 skin biopsy samples from 4 normal human donors and 9 patients with psoriasis was performed, using a mouse IgG1 antibody against human IL-21R produced at ZymoGenetics. For the psoriasis patients, a subset (5) provided samples from both lesional and non-lesional skin. A high degree of epidermal hyperplasia was noted in histopathology examination of the lesional skin from all donors. Immunoreactivity (staining) of IL-21R on specific cell types was scored based on frequency of positive cells and intensity of staining.\n\n\nResults: In normal skin and in non-lesional skin of psoriasis patients, staining for IL-21R was positive on occasional intra-epidermal mononuclear (MNC), scattered macrophages and fibroblast-like cells. Positive staining for IL-21R was present on high numbers of MNC in all of the lesional samples from psoriasis patients. Samples stained with a mouse isotype control antibody were negative. Minimal or no staining for IL-21R was present on epidermal keratinocytes from normal skin. In non-lesional skin biopsies from psoriasis patients, mild staining was observed in epidermal keratinocytes in 4 samples, and moderate staining was observed in the stratum spinosum in the fifth sample. There was mild to strong staining of focal areas of keratinocytes in the lesional samples from 8 of the 9 psoriasis patients.\n\n\nConclusion: In psoriatic skin lesions, the expression of IL-21R is not limited to infiltrating leukocytes but is also up-regulated on epidermal keratinocytes. The presence of increased staining for IL-21R on epidermal keratinocytes in non-lesional skin from psoriasis patients, compared with normal controls, suggests that even in non-involved skin, the keratinocytes may respond aberrantly to IL-21 stimulation. In the presence of inflammation, increased IL-21R on infiltrating MNC and in the hyperplastic epidermal layer was noted. Treatment of psoriasis with an IL-21 blocking antibody may therefore inhibit inflammation by blocking IL-21 signals to both inflammatory cells and epidermal keratinocytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21R Immunoreactivity\n1 \nin Normal, Non-Lesional,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand Lesional Psoriatic Skin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSkin Type (N)\n\n\nEpidermis\n2\n \n\n\nMNC\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNormal (4)\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPsoriasis Non-Lesional (5)\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPsoriasis Lesional\n3 \n(9)\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1\nScale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = strong for IL-21R expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2\nMedian score of all samples tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\nFive of the samples had donor-matched non-lesional skin biopsies"

Alternatively, the reaction can proceed in the presence of a suitable catalyst (for example, palladium di-benzyl-acetone), in the presence of a base (for example, caesium carbonate) and in the presence of a suitable reaction facilitator (for example, xanthphos).\n\n\nIf one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy or amino, are or need to be protected in a compound of formula II or III, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.\n\n\nThe protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as substitution reaction or solvolysis. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove.\n\n\nSalts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.\n\n\nSalts can usually be converted to compounds in free form, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.\n\n\nStereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.\n\n\nIt should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals can include for example the solvent used for crystallization (present as solvates).\n\n\nThe compound of formula II used as starting materials may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula IV\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith a compound of formula V\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare as defined above, and Y\n1 \nand Y\n2 \nare identical or different leaving groups as defined above for Y. The reaction conditions are those mentioned above for the reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of formula III.\n\n\n\nThe compounds of formula IV and V are known or may be produced in accordance with known procedures.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro in cell-free kinase assays and in cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase, and are useful as pharmaceuticals to treat conditions caused by a malfunction of signal cascades connected with Focal Adhesion Kinase, in particular tumors as described hereinbelow.\n\n\nFocal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a key enzyme in the integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascade (D. Schlaepfer et al., Prog Biophys Mol Biol 1999, 71, 435-478). Interaction between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is transduced as intracellular signals important for growth, survival and migration through cell surface receptors, integrins. FAK plays an essential role in these integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascades. The trigger in the signal transduction cascade is the autophosphorylation of Y397. Phosphorylated Y397 is a SH2 docking site for Src family tyrosine kinases. The bound c-Src kinase phosphorylates other tyrosine residues in FAK. Among them, phosphorylated Y925 becomes a binding site for the SH2 site of Grb2 small adaptor protein. This direct binding of Grb2 to FAK is one of the key steps for the activation of down stream targets such as the Ras-ERK2/MAP kinase cascade.\n\n\nThe inhibition of endogenous FAK signalling results in reduced motility and in some cases induces cell death. On the other hand, enhancing FAK signalling by exogenous expression increases cell motility and transmitting a cell survival signal from ECM. In addition FAK is overexpressed in invasive and metastatic epithelial, mesenchymal, thyroid and prostate cancers. Consequently, an inhibitor of FAK is likely to be a drug for anti-tumor growth and metastasis. The compounds of the invention are thus indicated, for example, to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by a neoplastic disease, in particular breast tumor, cancer of the bowel (colon and rectum), stomach cancer and cancer of the ovary and prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of liver, melanoma, bladder tumor and cancer of head and neck.\n\n\nThe relation between FAK inhibition and immuno-system is described e.g. in G. A. van Seventer et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 2001, 31, 1417-1427. Therefore, the compounds of the invention are, for example, useful to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by immune system disorders, diseases or disorders mediated by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, mast cells and/or eosinophils e.g. acute or chronic rejection of organ or tissue allo- or xenografts, atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion due to vascular injury such as angioplasty, restenosis, hypertension, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CNS disease such as Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, infectious disease such as AIDS, septic shock or adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia/reperfusion injury e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, or traumatic shock. The agent of the invention are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes (type I and II) and the disorders associated with therewith, respiratory diseases such as asthma or inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders or illnesses, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis), inflammatory eye diseases, e.g. Sjoegren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis or uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are active in a FAK assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC\n50 \nin the range of 1 nM to 100 nM. Particularly active are the compounds Example No. 3-12 and No. 3-17 described hereinbelow showing IC\n50 \nvales in the range of 1 to 5 nM.\n\n\nSome of the compounds of the invention exhibit also ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein of 70 kD) protein tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity. ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase interaction of the agents of the invention may be demonstrated by their ability to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. LAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell) by human ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase in aqueous solution, as described in the Examples. The compounds of the invention are thus also indicated for the prevention or treatment of disorders or diseases where ZAP-70 inhibition inhibition play a role.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are active in a ZAP-70 assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC\n50 \nin the range of 1 μM to 10 μM, e.g. the compounds Example No. 2 and No. 3-2 described hereinbelow.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention are also good inhibitors of the IGF-IR (insulin like growth factor receptor 1) and are therefore useful in the treatment of IGF-1R mediated diseases for example such diseases include proliferative diseases, such as tumours, like for example breast, renal, prostate, colorectal, thyroid, ovarian, pancreas, neuronal, lung, uterine and gastro-intestinal tumours as well as osteosarcomas and melanomas. The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using a cellular “Capture ELISA”. In this assay the activity of the compounds of the invention against Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induced autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR is determined.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro in cell-free kinase assays and in cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of the Invention are inhibitors of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), and are useful as pharmaceuticals to treat conditions caused by a malfunction of signal cascades connected with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, in particular tumors as described hereinbelow.\n\n\nALK-mediated signaling could play a role in the development and/or progression of a number of common solid tumors (Pulford, K., et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 2004 June; 199(3):330-58). The compounds of the present invention also exhibit powerful inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its fusion proteins, particularly the fusion protein of NPM-ALK. This protein tyrosine kinase results from a gene fusion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), rendering the protein tyrosine kinase activity of ALK ligand-independent. NPM-ALK plays a key role in signal transmission in a number of hematopoetic and other human cells leading to hematological and neoplastic diseases, for example in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), specifically In ALK+NHL or Alkomas, in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and neuroblastomas. (Duyster J et al. 2001 Oncogene 20, 5623-5637). NPM-ALK has been shown to be a potent oncogene in vitro, being able to transform various cell lines and primary hematopoetic cells. Furthermore, NPM-ALK transduced bone marrow cells are able to induce a lymphoma-like disease after transplantation into irradiated recipient mice. Signaling pathways activated by NPM-ALK include ras, PLC and PI3K pathways and, in addition, STAT5 has been shown to be phosphorylated by NPM-ALK. In addition to NPM-ALK, other gene fusions have been identified in human hematological and neoplastic diseases; mainly TPM3-ALK (a fusion of nonmuscle tropomyosin 3 with ALK). Further, the ALK fusion protein CLTC-ALK, is associated with diseases that include classical T cell or null ALCL, ALK\n+\n DLBCL and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. CLTCL-ALK is also thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of large B-cell lymphomas.\n\n\nFurther, the ALK fusion protein CLTC-ALK is associated with diseases that include classical T cell or null ALCL, ALK\n+\n DLBCL and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. CLTCL-ALK is also thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of large B-cell lymphomas.\n\n\nAberrant activity of ALK is involved in the development of brain tumors and overexpression of ALK has been reported in neuroblastomas and several cell lines derived from neural tissue. ALK-mediated signaling could play a role in the development and/or progression of a number of common solid tumors (Pulford, K., et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 2004 June; 199(3):330-58).\n\n\nThe inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using known methods, for example using the recombinant kinase domain of the ALK in analogy to the VEGF-R kinase assay described in J. Wood et al. Cancer Res. 60, 2178-2189 (2000). In vitro enzyme assays using GST-ALK protein tyrosine kinase are performed in 96-well plates as a filter binding assay in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH=7.5, 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MnCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 μCi/assay (=30 μl) [γ-\n33\nP]-ATP, 2 μM ATP, 3 μg/ml poly (Glu, Tyr4:1) Poly-EY (Sigma P-0275), 1% DMSO, 25 ng ALK enzyme. Assays are incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. Reactions are terminated by adding 50 μl of 125 mM EDTA, and the reaction mixture is transferred onto a MAIP Multiscreen plate (Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA), previously wet with methanol, and rehydrated for 5 min with H\n2\nO. Following washing (0.5% H\n3\nPO\n4\n), plates are counted in a liquid scintillation counter. IC\n50 \nvalues are calculated by linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition. Compared with the control without inhibitor, the compounds of formula I inhibit the enzyme activity by 50% (IC\n50\n), for example in a concentration of from 0.001 to 0.5 μM, especially from 0.01 to 0.1 μM.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I potently inhibit the growth of human NPM-ALK overexpressing murine BaF3 cells (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The expression of NPM-ALK is achieved by transfecting the BaF3 cell line with an expression vector pCIneo™ (Promega Corp., Madison Wis., USA) coding for NPM-ALK and subsequent selection of G418 resistant cells. Non-transfected BaF3 cells depend on IL-3 for cell survival. In contrast NPM-ALK expressing BaF3 cells (named BaF3-NPM-ALK hereinafter) can proliferate in the absence of IL-3 because they obtain proliferative signal through NPM-ALK kinase. Putative inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase therefore abolish the growth signal and result in antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity of putative inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase can however be overcome by addition of IL-3 which provides growth signals through an NPM-ALK independent mechanism. [For an analogous cell system using FLT3 kinase see E Weisberg et al. Cancer Cell; 1, 433-443 (2002)]. The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula I is determined, briefly, as follows: BaF3-NPM-ALK cells (15,000/microtitre plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtitre plates. The test compounds [dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] are added in a series of concentrations (dilution series) in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1% (v/v). After the addition, the plates are incubated for two days during which the control cultures without test compound are able to undergo two cell-division cycles. The growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells is measured by means of Yopro™ staining [T Idziorek et al. J. Immunol. Methods; 185: 249-258 (1995)]: 25 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0, 26.8 mM sodium chloride, 0.4% NP40, 20 mM EDTA and 20 mM is added to each well. Cell lysis is completed within 60 min at room temperature and total amount of Yopro bound to DNA is determined by measurement using the Cytofluor II 96-well reader (PerSeptive Biosystems) with the following settings: Excitation (nm) 485/20 and Emission (nm) 530/25. IC\n50 \nvalues are determined by a computer-aided system using the formula:\n\n\n\nIC\n \n50\n=[(\nABS\n \ntest\n \n−ABS\n \nstart\n)/(\nABS\n \ncontrol\n \n−ABS\n \nstart\n)]×100. (ABS=absorbtion)\n\n\n\nThe IC\n50 \nvalue in those experiments is given as that concentration of the test compound in question that results in a cell count that is 50% lower than that obtained using the control without inhibitor. The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC\n50 \nin the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 μM.\n\n\nThe antiproliferative action of the compounds of formula I can also be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) [described in W G Dirks et al. Int. J. Cancer 100, 49-56 (2002)] using the same methodology described above for the BaF3-NPM-ALK cell line. The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC\n50 \nin the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 μM.\n\n\nThe action of the compounds of formula I on autophosphorylation of the ALK can be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line by means of an immunoblot as described in W G Dirks et al. Int. J. Cancer 100, 49-56 (2002). In that test the compounds of formula I exhibit an IC\n50 \nof approximately from 0.001 to 1 μM.\n\n\nAmong the compounds of formula I, 2-[5-chloro-2-(2-methoxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-ylamino]-N-methyl-benzamide is an especially potent ALK inhibitor, in that this compound inhibits the growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells with an IC\n50 \nof 97 nM. Further specifically preferred compounds that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the compounds described hereinafter in the examples 7A and 7B, as well as 7-2, 7-15, 19-5, 21-1, 26-3 and 28-5, respectively, all of which are having an IC\n50 \nwithin the range from <0.5 to 200 nM.\n\n\nFor the above uses in the treatment of neoplastic diseases and immune system disorders the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 2000 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent may be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms for oral administration contain, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active substance. Topical administration is e.g. to the skin. A further form of topical administration is to the eye.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes.\n\n\nPreference is given to the use of solutions of the active ingredient, and also suspensions or dispersions, especially isotonic aqueous solutions, dispersions or suspensions which, for example in the case of lyophilized compositions comprising the active ingredient alone or together with a carrier, for example mannitol, can be made up before use. The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilized and/or may comprise excipients, for example preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilizers, salts for regulating osmotic pressure and/or buffers and are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional dissolving and lyophilizing processes. The said solutions or suspensions may comprise viscosity-increasing agents, typically sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or gelatins, or also solubilizers, e.g. Tween 80® (polyoxyethylene(20)sorbitan mono-oleate).\n\n\nSuspensions in oil comprise as the oil component the vegetable, synthetic, or semi-synthetic oils customary for injection purposes. In respect of such, special mention may be made of liquid fatty acid esters that contain as the acid component a long-chained fatty acid having from 8 to 22, especially from 12 to 22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, brassidic acid or linoleic acid, if desired with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, β-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. The alcohol component of these fatty acid esters has a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and is a monovalent or polyvalent, for example a mono-, di- or trivalent, alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or pentanol or the isomers thereof, but especially glycol and glycerol. As fatty acid esters, therefore, the following are mentioned: ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, “Labrafil M 2375” (polyoxyethylene glycerol), “Labrafil M 1944 CS” (unsaturated polyglycolized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of apricot kernel oil and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester), “Labrasol” (saturated polyglycolized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of TCM and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester; all available from Gattefossé, France), and/or “Miglyol 812” (triglyceride of saturated fatty acids of chain length C\n8 \nto C\n12 \nfrom Hüls AG, Germany), but especially vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and more especially groundnut oil.\n\n\nThe manufacture of injectable preparations is usually carried out under sterile conditions, as is the filling, for example, into ampoules or vials, and the sealing of the containers.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained, for example, by combining the active ingredient with one or more solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, by the inclusion of additional excipients, to form tablets or tablet cores.\n\n\nSuitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations, and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and also binders, such as starches, for example corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Additional excipients are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol, or derivatives thereof.\n\n\nTablet cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings through the use of, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes or pigments may be added to the tablets or tablet coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration also include hard capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft, sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as corn starch, binders, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquid excipients, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols or fatty acid esters of ethylene or propylene glycol, to which stabilizers and detergents, for example of the polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester type, may also be added.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient and a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols.\n\n\nFor parenteral administration, aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example of a water-soluble salt, or aqueous injection suspensions that contain viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, if desired, stabilizers, are especially suitable. The active ingredient, optionally together with excipients, can also be in the form of a lyophilizate and can be made into a solution before parenteral administration by the addition of suitable solvents.\n\n\nSolutions such as are used, for example, for parenteral administration can also be employed as infusion solutions.\n\n\nPreferred preservatives are, for example, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, or microbicides, such as sorbic acid or benzoic acid.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered as the sole active ingredient or together with other drugs useful against neoplastic diseases or useful in immunomodulating regimens. For example, the agents of the invention may be used in accordance with the invention in combination with pharmaceutical compositions effective in various diseases as described above, e.g. with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, fludarabine, gemcitabine, cisplatinum, carboplatin, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide, irinotecan, paclitaxel, docetaxel, rituxan, doxorubicine, gefitinib, or imatinib; or also with cyclosporins, rapamycins, ascomycins or their immunosuppressive analogs, e.g. cyclosporin A, cyclosporin G, FK-506, sirolimus or everolimus, corticosteroids, e.g. prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprene, methotrexate, gold salts, sulfasalazine, antimalarials, brequinar, leflunomide, mizoribine, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate, mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualine, immuno-suppressive monoclonal antibodies, e.g. monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte receptors, e.g. MHC, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD25, CD28, CD40, CD45, CD58, CD80, CD86, CD152, CD137, CD154, ICOS, LFA-1, VLA-4 or their ligands, or other immunomodulatory compounds, e.g. CTLA4Ig.\n\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides:\n\n\n(1) A compound of the invention for use as a pharmaceutical,\n\n\n(2) a compound of the invention for use as a 5-Chloro-N*2*-{2-methoxy-4-[4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-phenyl}-N*4*-[2-(propane-2-sulfonyl)-phenyl]-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, for example for use in any of the particular indications hereinbefore set forth;\n\n\n(3) a pharmaceutical composition, e.g. for use in any of the indications herein before set forth, comprising a compound of the invention as active ingredient together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers;\n\n\n(4) a method for the treatment of any particular indication set forth hereinbefore in a subject in need thereof which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising same;\n\n\n(5) the use of a compound of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a disease or condition in which FAK and/or ALK and/or ZAP-70 and/or IGF-I activation plays a role or is implicated, preferably ALK;\n\n\n(6) the method as defined above under (4) comprising co-administration, e.g. concomitantly or in sequence, of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more further drug substances, said further drug substance being useful in any of the particular indications set forth hereinbefore;\n\n\n(7) a combination comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more further drug substances, said further drug substance being useful in any of the particular indications set forth hereinbefore;\n\n\n(8) use of a compound of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a disease which responds to inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase;\n\n\n(9) the use according to (8), wherein the disease to be treated is selected from lymphoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and neuroblastomas;\n\n\n(10) the use according to (8) or (9), wherein the compound is 2-[5-chloro-2-(2-methoxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-ylamino]-N-methyl-benzamide or 5-Chloro-N*2*-{2-methoxy-4-[4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-phenyl}-N*4*-[2-(propane-2-sulfonyl)-phenyl]-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or any of the compounds described hereinafter in the examples or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any one of these;\n\n\n(11) a method for the treatment of a disease which responds to inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, especially a disease selected from anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and neuroblastomas, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention, especially 2-[5-chloro-2-(2-methoxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-ylamino]-N-methyl-benzamide or 5-Chloro-N*2*-{2-methoxy-4-[4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-phenyl}-N*4*-[2-(propane-2-sulfonyl)-phenyl]-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n\nAdditionally preferred a compound according to the present invention that is useful as herein before described is a compound specifically mentioned in the examples.

Then, the selective Lck inhibitor PP2 (1-tert-butyl-3-(4-chloro-phenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine; Alexis Biochemicals) is added (final concentration 1.2 μM) and incubated for further 10 min. 10 μL of this solution is mixed with the 10 μL biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (1 μM) as substrate and 20 μL of serial dilutions of inhibitors and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The kinase reaction is terminated with 10 μL of a 10 mM EDTA solution in detection buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20). 50 μL europium-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu-PT66; final concentration 0.125 nM); and 50 μL streptavidin-allophycocyanine (SA-APC; final concentration 40 nM) in detection buffer are added. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature fluorescence is measured on the Victor2 Multilabel Counter (Wallac) at 665 nm. Background values (low control) are obtained in the absence of test samples and ATP and are subtracted from all values. Signals obtained in the absence of test samples are taken as 100% (high control). The inhibition obtained in the presence of test compounds is calculated as percent inhibition of the high control. The concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% inhibition (IC\n50\n) is determined from the dose-response curves. In this assay, the agents of the invention have IC\n50 \nvalues in the range of 10 nM to 2 μM, preferably from 10 nM to 100 nM.\n\n\nRecombinant ZAP-70 kinase is obtained as follows: A nucleic acid encoding full-length human ZAP-70 (GenBank #L05148) is amplified from a Jurkat cDNA library by RT-PCR and cloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, California, USA). The authenticity of the ZAP-70 cDNA insert is validated by complete sequence analysis. This donor plasmid is then used to construct a recombinant baculovirus transfer vector based on the plasmid pVL1392 (Pharmingen, California, USA) featuring in addition an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Following co-transfection with AcNPV viral DNA, 10 independent viral isolates are derived via plaque-purification, amplified on small scale and subsequently analyzed for recombinant ZAP-70 expression by Western Blot using a commercially available anti-ZAP-70 antibody (Clone 2F3.1, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, N.Y., USA). Upon further amplification of one positive recombinant plaque, titrated virus stocks are prepared and used for infection of Sf9 cells grown in serum-free SF900 II medium (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) under defined, optimized conditions. ZAP-70 protein is isolated from the lysate of infected Sf9 cells by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTAcolumn (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland).\n\n\nRecombinant His-tagged ZAP-70 is also available from PanVera LLC, Madison, Wis., USA.\n\n\nLAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell): The biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (Biotin-EEGAPDYENLQELN) used as a substrate in the ZAP-70 kinase assay is prepared in analogy to known methods of peptide synthesis. The N-α Fmoc group of Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-oxymethyl-4-phenoxymethyl-co(polystyrene-1%-divinyl-benzene), content of Asn approx. 0.5 mmol/g, is cleaved using piperidine, 20% in DMF. Four equivalents per amino-group of Fmoc-amino acid protected in their side chains [Asp(OtBu), Glu(OtBu), Asn(Trt), Gln(Trt) and Tyr(tBu)] are coupled using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF. After complete assembly of the peptide chain the terminal Fmoc-protecting group is removed with piperidine in DMF as before. L(+)-biotinyl-aminohexanoic acid is then coupled to the terminal amino group using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF using four equivalents of the reagents for four days at RT. The peptide is cleaved from the resin support and all side-chain protecting groups are simultaneously removed by using a reagent consisting of 5% dodecylmethylsulfide and 5% water in TFA for two hours at RT. Resin particles are filtered off, washed with TFA and the product is precipitated from the combined filtrates by the addition of 10 to 20 volumes of diethyl ether, washed with ether and dried. The product is purified by chromatography on a C-18 wide-pore silica column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 2% aqueous phosphoric acid. Fractions containing the pure compound are collected, filtered through an anion-exchange resin (Biorad, AG4-X4 acetate form) and lyophilized to give the title compound. MS: 1958.0 (M-H)\n−1 \n \n\n\nExample 56\n\n\nAnchorage-Independent Tumor Cell Growth Assay\n\n\nMouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells (5×10\n3\n) are plated in 96-well Ultra low Attachment plates (#3474, Corning Inc.) in 100 μL of Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% FBS. Cells are cultured for 2 h and inhibitors are added at various concentrations in a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO. After 48 h, cell growth is assayed with the cell counting kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemical), which uses a water soluble tetrazolium salt WST8. Twenty μL of the reagent is added into each well and cells are further cultured for 2 h. The optical density is measured at 450 nm. The concentration of compound causing 50% inhibition of growth is determined.\n\n\nExample 59 \n\n\nIn Vivo Activity in the Nude Mouse Xenograft Model\n\n\nfemale or male BALB/c nude mice (5-8 weeks old, Charles River Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) are kept under sterile conditions with water and feed ad libitum. Tumours are induced by subcutaneous injection of tumour cells (human epithelial cell line MIA PaCa-2; European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK, Catalogue Number 85062806; cell line from a 65 year old Caucasian male; undifferentiated human pancreatic carcinoma cell line) into left or right flank of mice under Forene® anaesthesia (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Treatment with the test compound is started when the mean tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm\n3\n. Tumour growth is measured two times per week and 1 day after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpendicular axis. The tumour volumes are calculated in accordance with published methods (see Evans et al., Brit. J. Cancer 45, 466-8, 1982). The anti-tumour efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumour volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tumour volume of the untreated animals (controls) and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as delta T/C [%]. Tumour regression is reported as the mean changes of tumor volume of the treated animals divided by the mean tumor volume at start of treatment and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as regression [%]. The test compound is orally administered daily with or without drug holidays.\n\n\nAs an alternative to cell line MIA PaCa-2, another cell line may also be used in the same manner, for example:\n\n \n \n \n \nthe 4T1 breast carcinoma cell line (ATCC Number CRL-2539; see also Cancer. 88(12 Supple), 2979-2988, 2000) with female BALB/c mice (injection into mammary fat pad).\n \n \n \n\n\nOn the basis of these studies, a compound of formula I according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against proliferative diseases responsive to an inhibition of a tyrosine kinase.\n\n\nExample 60\n\n\nTablets\n\n\nTablets comprising 50 mg of active ingredient, for example one of the compounds of formula I described in Examples 1 to 131, and having the following composition are prepared in customary manner:\n\n\nComposition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\n50\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwheat starch\n\n\n150\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlactose\n\n\n125\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncolloidal silicic acid\n\n\n12.5\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntalc\n\n\n22.5\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmagnesium stearate\n\n\n2.5\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal:\n\n\n362.5\n\n\nmg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: The active ingredient is mixed with a portion of the wheat starch, with the lactose and the colloidal silicic acid and the mixture is forced through a sieve. A further portion of the wheat starch is made into a paste, on a water bath, with five times the amount of water and the powder mixture is kneaded with the paste until a slightly plastic mass is obtained.\n\n\nThe plastic mass is pressed through a sieve of about 3 mm mesh size and dried, and the resulting dry granules are again forced through a sieve.
