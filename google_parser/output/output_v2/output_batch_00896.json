Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is generally directed to pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives and methods and compositions that employ such compounds. In particular embodiments, the compounds are useful as agonists of the DP\n1\n receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstaglandins (PGs), members of the prostanoid family, are formed by the actions of cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 on arachidonic acid. The biological activities of PGs include, for example, contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle, inhibition and enhancement of neurotransmitter release, inhibition of lipolysis, inhibition of gastric secretion, inhibition of inflammatory mediator release (\nColeman et al., Prostanoids and Their Receptors. In Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 3 Ed. J.C. Emmett, 643-714, Pergammon Press, Oxford, UK, 1990\n) that are mediated by different receptor subtypes. To date, there are at least 8 known receptors that mediate the action of PGs. PGE2 has 4 receptor subtypes (EP\n1\n-\n4\n receptors), whereas PGs D\n2\n, F\n2\n, I\n2\n, and thromboxane (TX) A2 each have a single receptor (DP, FP, IP, and TP receptors, respectively; \nNarumiya et al., Physiol Rev. 79:1193-1226 1999\n).\n\nFurther descriptions of these receptors may be found in e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,606,814\n \n and \n \n5,759,789\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies from knock-out mice lacking each type and sub-type of the EP receptor are instructive with respect to the roles of different prostaglandin receptors. For example mice lacking EP receptors showed different roles for the various different types and subtypes of EP receptors (\nUshikubi at al. Jpn. J. Pharmacol., 83, 279-285, 2000\n) in various mechanisms such as ovulation, blood pressure control, closure of ductus arteriosus and bone resorption. Additional roles of EP receptors have been reported such as smooth muscle relaxation in cat trachea for EP\n2\n, vasodilatation for EP\n4\n (\nGardinier, Br. J. Pharmac. 1986, 87, 45-56\n; \nColeman et al. 1994 Pharmacological Reviews 46 (2), 205-229\n) and anti-inflammatory activity for EP\n4\n (\nTakayama et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277, 46,44147-44154, 2002\n). Renal Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is crucial for normal renal function by dilating the glomerular microcirculation and vasa recta, supplying the renal medulla and modulating salt and water transport in the distal tubule. There are multiple (at least two) receptor types for DP. Studies similar to the EP receptor studies would be instructive on the roles of the different DP receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a natural ligand for all sub-types of the EP receptor. Consequently, selective effects on one of the sub-types of the EP receptor is difficult to achieve with the endogenous prostaglandins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain prostanoid receptors and modulators of those receptors have been largely reported (\nEicosanoids: From Biotechnology to Therapeutic Applications (Plenum Press, New York\n); \nJournal of Lipid Mediators and Cell Signalling 14: 83-87 (1996\n); \nThe British Journal of Pharmacology, 112: 735-740 (1994\n); \n \nWO 96/06822\n \n; \n \nWO 97/00863\n \n; \n \nWO 97/00864\n \n; \n \nWO 96/03380\n \n; \n \nEP 752421\n \n; \n \nUS 6,211,197\n \n, \n \nUS 4,211,876\n \n; \n \nUS 3,873,566\n \n; and \nBennett et al. J. Med. Chem., 19 (5): 715-717 (1976\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain prostaglandin ligands and analogs have been reported to provide biological activity associated with prostaglandins (\n \nU. S. 6,288,120\n \n; \n \nUS 6,211,197\n \n; \n \nUS 4,090,019\n \n; \n \nUS 4,033,989\n \n; \n \nUS 4,003,911\n \n). E-type prostaglandin effects have been reported to be mediated through interaction with the prostaglandin E receptor(s). Certain compounds also have been reported as EP\n4\n agonists (\n \nWO 02/24647\n \n, \n \nEP1110949A1\n \n, \n \nW003/009872\n \n and \n \nWO 03/007941\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUS Patents 4,156,730\n \n; \n \n4,138,407\n \n and \n \n4,299,970\n \n all deal with hydroxypyrrolidinone having anti-gastric secretion activity, anti-ulcer activity, cardiovascular activity, antihypertensive activity, platelet aggregation inhibition activity, bronchodilator activity, anti-fertility and smooth muscle activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object of the invention is to provide new compounds and use of these compounds for the treatment of diseases and disorders associated with the prostaglandin family of compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis is achieved by compounds that may be used as agonists of prostaglandin receptors.

Such property can be readily determined by those skilled in the art (for example, see \nBoie, Y. et al Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 340, 227-241\n or\n Abramovitz M. et al Biochim at Biophysica Acta 2000, 1483,285-293\n). A variety of such compounds are described and referenced herein. However, other prostaglandin DP\n1\n agonists will be known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary DP\n1\n agonists are disclosed as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"selective binding to the DP\n1\n receptor\" refers to compounds that are selective in comparison to the other prostaglandin receptors, particularly DP\n2\n, EP\n1\n and/or EP\n3\n, optionally EP\n2\n. Selectivity in this connection means that the affinity of the compounds of the invention for the DP\n1\n receptor is at least more than 2 times higher than the affinity for another prostaglandin receptor, more preferably, the affinity is at least 5 time higher, even more preferably the affinity is more than 10 times and in particular more than 100 or 1000 times the affinity for other prostaglandin receptors like EP\n1\n or EP\n3\n and at least more than 2 times, especially more than 10 times the affinity for the DP\n2\n receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"fertility condition(s)\" also refers to a condition, particularly infertility, of a female mammal, especially a female patient. This condition includes conditions where ovulation triggering is needed. Examples of female patients in such a condition are female undergoing a treatment for ovulation induction or an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"ovulation induction\" (OI), refers to the stimulation of release of an oocyte (occasionally two or three oocytes) into the fallopian tubes of a female patient, for in vivo fertilisation. OI is used in anovulatory patients [for example, WHO group I patients(hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) and WHO group II anovulation (hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction resulting in arrested or attenuated gonadal function), including patients suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)]. It is usually desired to stimulate the release of a single oocyte, in order to avoid the risks associated with multiple pregnancies. In a typical ovulation induction regimen, the patient is administered FSH, an analogue of FSH or a molecule stimulating endogenous FSH production to stimulate follicular growth for several days until at least one follicle is observed (by ultrasound) with a mean diameter of approximately 17 mm or greater. At this stage, an ovulation trigger (hCG) is given to stimulate rupture of the follicle and release of an oocyte into the fallopian tube (\"ovulation triggering\"). The molecules of the invention can replace or supplement the ovulation triggering dose of hCG in an OI regimen. Combination therapies using a combination of the compound of the present invention and one or more of the compounds traditionally employed in an OI regimen is specifically contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Assisted Reproduction Technology\" includes for example, in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Oocytes are harvested from mature follicles immediately before rupture, and graded before being fertilised in vitro by combination with sperm. The resulting embryos are graded for quality, and usually 2 to 3 are selected for placement in the uterus (remaining embryos can be cryopreserved for future attempts).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of the many factors involved in establishing an ongoing pregnancy, many patients must have oocytes placed in the uterus multiple times before success is achieved. Because of this, in contrast to 01 regimens, for ART it is desired to harvest multiple oocytes, in order to maximise the chances of successful pregnancy. The controlled development of multiple preovulatory follicles by administration of exogenous agents capable of inducing follicular growth (such as FSH) is called controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). When there are at least 3 follicles with a mean diameter greater than 16mm, ovulation is triggered (hCG bolus). Oocytes are usually recovered from pre-ovulatory follicles, by aspiration. The molecules of the invention can replace or supplement the ovulation triggering dose of hCG in an ART regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will be described below by means of the following Examples.\n\n\n \n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are hereinafter used in the accompanying examples: min (minute), hr (hour), i. p.

Swem oxidation of the primary alcohol gave the aldehyde intermediate \n9.\n Wittig reaction using the desired phosphonate followed by the esterification of the acid intermediate yielded the intermediate \n10.\n Catalytic hydrogenation of the double bond under acidic conditions gave the alcohol intermediate \n11.\n Saponification of the ester group gave in almost quantitative yield the desired pyrrolidin-2-one derivative.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional preferred syntheses of compounds of the invention are detailed in the examples provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred uses of the invention include inhibiting undesired smooth muscle contraction, including undesired prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction.

The compounds of the present invention are preferably specific for the DP\n1\n receptor. Both the DP\n1\n and the DP\n2\n receptors are well known to those of skill in the art and have been described e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,395,499\n \n; \nHawcroft et al.,(Cancer Lett. 2004 Jul 8;210(1):81-4\n, describing expression of prostaglandin D2 receptors DP\n1\n and DP\n2\n by human colorectal cancer cells); \nHammad et al., (J Immunol. 2003 Oct 15;171(8):3936-40\n; describing activation by prostaglandin D2 of DP\n1\n receptor in airway dendritic cell migration and function); \nMonneret et al., (Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1942-8\n), describing DP\n2\n receptors in human eosinophils). Other prostaglandin receptors that may be used to test the activity of the present compounds include EP\n1\n, EP\n2\n, EP\n3\n, EP\n4\n, FP, IP and TP\n\n\n \n\n\n5.1 Stable Expression of Prostanoid Receptors in Cell Line\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProstanoid receptor cDNAs corresponding to full length coding sequences are well known to those of skill in the art and may be subcloned into the appropriate sites of mammalian expression vectors and transfected into any host cell commonly used for stable transfection. Such cells include e.g., VERO cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, COS cells (such as COS-7), W138, BHK, HepG2, 3T3, RIN, MDCK, A549, PC12, K562 and HEK 293 cells. A preferred cell line for use in such embodiments is the human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) that hasve been transfected with and express the EBNA-1 protein. Upon tranfection, the HEK 293(ebna) cells expressing the individual cDNAs are grown under selection and individual colonies are isolated after 2-3 weeks of growth using the cloning ring method and subsequently expanded into clonal cell lines.\n\n\n \n\n\n5.2 Prostanoid Receptor Binding Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHEK 293(ebna) cells or other cells stably transfected with the appropriate receptor are maintained in culture, harvested and membranes are prepared by differential centrifugation, following lysis of the cells in the presence of protease inhibitors, for use in receptor binding assays. Prostanoid receptor binding assays are performed in 10 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.0) (EPs, FP and TP) or 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) (DP and IP), containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM divalent cation and the appropriate radioligand for the given receptor. The reaction is initiated by addition of membrane protein. Typically, the ligands are added in a solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1% (v/v) in all incubations. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 1 µM of the corresponding non-radioactive prostanoid. Incubations are conducted for 60 min at room temperature or 30°C and terminated by rapid filtration. Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding. The residual specific binding at each ligand concentration is calculated and expressed as a function of ligand concentration in order to construct sigmoidal concentration-response curves for determination of ligand affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another protocol, compounds of the invention are tested in DP\n1\n receptor binding assay of the following protocol. A mixture containing 20µg of DP\n1\n receptor membranes, 0.5 mg of wheat germ agglutinin coated PVT-SPA beads, plus or minus a test compound of the invention (25 µl per well) or 10 µM of cold PGE2 at 1 % DMSO and 20 nM radiolabeled ligand for the receptor(e.g., tritiated-PGE2) in assay buffer containing 25 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.0 are incubated in Coming 3600 plates on a plate shaker for 2 hrs at room temperature. Binding of the radiolabeled ligand binding is evaluated by counting the plates on the top count using the 3H SPA dpm2 program. % Binding and Ki value for inhibitors are calculated based on the one site competition parameter using the Graphpad® prism program. Such an assay may be modified by employing the different receptors and their specific ligands to assess the activity of the compounds of the present invention against such receptors. Using such an assay, the DP\n1\n Ki values for a number of exemplary compounds of the present invention were calculated and are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from the Table below, a comparison of the Ki values against DP\n1\n as compared to Ki values of these compounds against DP\n2\n, shows that exemplary agonists of the present invention are specific for DP\n1\n as compared to these other prostaglandin receptors (K\ni\n values for h-EP\n2,\n h-EP\n3\n and h-EP\n4\n of > 10000 nM).\n\n \n \nTable 1:\n Inhibition of DP\n1\n \n \n \n \nExample #\n \nH-DP\n1\n K\ni\n \n \nH-DP\n1\n EC\n50\n \n \nh-DP\n2\n K\ni\n \n \n \n \n(nM)\n \n(nM)\n \n(nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nn=2\n \n \n \n \n \nPGD2\n \n \n4.1\n \n0.3\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBW245C\n \n \n \n \n0.031\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n2.4\n \n0.00072\n \n>10000\n \n \n \n \n2\n \n \n10.5\n \n0.71\n \n>10000\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n1.8\n \n0.037\n \n>10000\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \n47.2\n \n1.38\n \n>10000\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.3 Whole cell second messenger assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhole cell second messenger assays measuring stimulation (EP\n2\n, EP\n4\n, DP\n1\n, DP\n2\n and IP in HEK 293(ebna) cells) or inhibition (EP\n3\n in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells) of intracellular cAMP accumulation or mobilization of intracellular calcium (EP\n1\n, FP and TP in HEK 293(ebna) cells stably transfected with apo-aequorin) are performed to determine whether receptor ligands are agonists or antagonists. For cAMP assays, cells are harvested and resuspended in HBSS containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Incubations contain 100 µM RO-20174 (phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor, available from Biomol) and, in the case of the EP\n3\n inhibition assay only, 15 µM forskolin to stimulate cAMP production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples are incubated at 37°C for 10 min, the reaction is terminated and cAMP levels are then measured. For calcium mobilization assays, cells are charged with the co-factors reduced glutathione and coelenterazine, harvested and resuspended in Ham's F12 medium. Calcium mobilization is measured by monitoring luminescence provoked by calcium binding to the intracellular photoprotein aequorin. Ligands are added in dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1% (v/v) in all incubations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor agonists, second messenger responses are expressed as a function of ligand concentration and both EC50 values and the maximum response as compared to a prostanoid standard are calculated. For antagonists, the ability of a ligand to inhibit an agonist response is determined by Schild analysis and both KB and slope values are calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another exemplary protocol, HEK293-EBNA cells transfected with the appropriate receptors are seeded in 96 well opaque plate (Costar #3917) at 4x10\n4\n cells per well in 100 µl of culture medium (D- MEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 nM L-glutamine, and 250 µg/ml of hygromycin; all from GibcoBRL) and incubated at 37°C. After overnight incubation, the medium was removed from each well and replaced with 45 µl of assay medium consisted of phenol red free D-MEM/F-12, 0.1 % BSA (GibcoBRL) and 0.1 mM 3 isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (Sigma). After 15 minutes of incubation at 37°C, 16-16-dimethyl PGE-2 or compounds at desired concentrations in 20 µl of assay medium were added to cells and further incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Total cAMP (intra-and extracellular) was measured by using a cAMP-screen ELISA System (Tropix #CS1000).\n\n\n \n\n\n5.4 In vivo ovulation assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOvulation triggering activity of compounds of the invention are tested in a mature mouse ovulation induction model. Mature 10-week-old CD-mice are used. Reagents are prepared as follows: PMSG (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin) (Calbiochem, cat #367222) and hCG (Serono) are diluted in PBS. PGE2 (Cayman, Ann Arbor MI) is dissolved in ethanol and diluted with 0.154 M NaHCO\n2\n Buffer (pH 8. 0) to final concentration of ethanol of less than 3 percent. A test compound (based on solubility) is pre-dissolved in ethanol, DMSO or other reagents. Test compound is then diluted with saline or other diluents such as PBS or NP3S (5% N-methyl-pyrrolidinone/30% PEG-400/25% PEG-200/20% Propylene Glycol in saline). PMSG serves to stimulate follicle growth and maturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMature follicles will ovulate when an ovulation triggering dose of hCG or an hCG replacement is administered. The following test protocol was employed for the test animals (typically 5 animals per test group).\n\nDay 1: Inject 5IU PMSG in 200 UL PBS (i. p. 15: 00 PM)\n\nDay 2: No administration\n\nDay 3: Inject an ovulation triggering dose of hCG (i.p.) or hCG replacement (PGE2 or compound of the invention, s.c., i.v. or oral route), 15:00 PM\n\nDay 4: Eighteen hours after injections of ovulation triggers, animals were sacrificed by CO\n2\n asphyxiation and abdominal cavities were opened using fine scissors and forceps. Uterus, oviducts and ovaries were collected and placed in pre-labeled dishes containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The collected tissues were transferred to the laboratory and intact oviduct carefully dissected out from uterus and ovary under the dissection microscope. The dissected oviducts were placed on the glass microscopic slide and covered with another slide. Two slides were taped on two edges. The numbers of ovulated ova in the oviducts were counted using upright microscope with 4x objective and recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor evaluating the oral activity of this compound, two experiments were conducted, the first experiment was conducted with non-fasted animals and the second experiment was conducted in 24 h fasted animals (water provided). The compounds of the invention, according to their solubility are pre-dissolved in ethanol, DMSO or other reagents. The compounds of the invention are then diluted with saline or other diluents such as PBS or NP3S before oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may be tested in the in vivo ovulation induction model as described above in order to assess the ability of those compounds to trigger ovulation via subcutaneous(sc), oral (po) and intravenous (iv) routes of administration. Test groups may be assessed as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGroups\n \n \n \nPriming\n \n \n \nTreatments\n \n \n \n \n \nGroup 1\n \n5IU PMSG\n \nControl Vehicle\n \n \n \nGroup 2\n \n5IU PMSG\n \nHCG (0.12 mg/kg i. p. )\n \n \n \nGroup 3\n \n5IU PMSG\n \nPGE2 (13.5 mg/kg)\n \n \n \nGroup 4\n \n5IU PMSG\n \nTest compound (10 mg/kg)\n \n \n \nGroup 5\n \n5IU PMSG\n \nTest compound (30 mg/kg)\n \n \n \nGroup 6\n \n5IU PMSG\n \nTest compound (90 mg/kg)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing test groups as set forth above, it is possible to determine the number of ova obtained from each group and thereby assess the effects of the compounds on stimulation of ovulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonists of DP\n1\n are selected using the assays described above on the basis of their Ki and/or EC\n50\n values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are then tested in the in vivo ovulation induction model as described above in order to calculated the ED\n50\n for subcutaneous (s. c. ) and oral (po) routes of administration. Data also may be obtained for reference compounds (sulprostone and butaprost) that do not fulfill the selection criteria for DP\n1\n agonists in order to provide a comparison of activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn exemplary embodiments, oral activity in the in vivo model of ovulation induction is evaluated for other compounds of the invention at the single dose of 20 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is desirable that the compounds of the invention are able to stimulate ovulation induction in mature mice in at least one of the routes of administration. Preferably, the compounds are able to stimulate ovulation in all three routes of administration (sc, iv, and po).\n\n\n \n\n\n5.5. In vivo inhibition of Guinea Pig broncho-constriction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGuinea pig pulmonary-cholinergic in vivo model is generally used to test the materials for the treatments of asthma in human (\nFleisch at al. 1985, K. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 233: 148-157\n). Compounds of the invention are tested in this model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroups of 3 Duncan Hartley derived male or female guinea pigs weighing 250±50 g are anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p., plus an additional 15 mg/kg i.p. if required) and succinylcholine chloride (2 mg/animal i. p.) is subsequently administered to prevent spontaneous respiration. Body temperature is maintained at 37°C to 38°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe trachea is cannulated and the guinea pig is ventilated with a Harvard rodent respirator in a closed system. Tracheal pressure is recorded through a side-arm of the cannula connected to a P23ID Statham transducer. Respiratory rate is set at 50 strokes/minute with a stroke volume (approximately 1 ml/100 g) sufficient to produce a baseline tracheal pressure of 6 cmH\n2\n0. Mean arterial pressure (BP) is monitored from a cannulated carotid artery, and heart rate (HR) is obtained from chest electrodes arranged for lead II. The jugular vein is cannulated for i. v. vehicle or drug administration in a volume of 1 ml/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCholinergic-induced bronchoconstrictor responses, reflected as increases in tracheal pressure (cm H\n2\nO), are elicited by administration of methacholine hydrochloride (10 µg/kg base weight i. v. ). In vehicle-treated control animals, methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction ranges from 70 to 90 percent of its own maximum response (about 40 to 65 percent of maximum possible bronchoconstriction obtained by tracheal occlusion).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are also tested via intratracheal (IT) route of administration. In this other experiment, a test compound of the invention, reference compound or vehicle is administered IT 10 (5 min for experiment 1 and 2) minutes before methacholine chloride (10 µg/kg i. v. ) induced bronchoconstriction. Tracheal pressure (ITP), blood pressure and heart rate are measured immediately as indicated in the material and methods sections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMED (medium effective dose) is measured. A 50 percent or greater(≥50%) inhibition of the induced bronchoconstriction relative to vehicle treated control animals is considered significant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are administered i. v. (10 mg/kg) 5 minutes before subministration of the methacoline hydrochloride challenge in 3 guinea pigs. A 50 percent or more(≥50) inhibition of the induced bronchoconstriction relative to vehicle treated control animals is considered significant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compounds of the invention are injected i. v. to different concentrations from 3 x 10\n5\n mg/kg up to 0.3 mg/kg. From such studies, the concentration at which methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction (> 50%) inhibitions are observed may readily be calculated and the in vivo effective dose(ED\n50\n) determined. Preferably, although not necessarily, the compounds do not alter blood pressure or heart beat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn these model studies the doses may be varied. For examplem the compound may be tested at 0.04, 0.4, 4.0 and 40 µg/guinea pig. Reference material e.g., salbutamol (40 µg/animal) and vehicle control were also may be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConducting the above studies demonstrates the ability of the compounds of the invention to produce dilation of bronchiolar muscles, which resulted in inhibition of methacholine-induced bronchomuscle constriction.\n\n\n \n \n5.5. In vivo inhibition of LPS-induced TNF\nα \nrelease in mice.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe agonists of the invention may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents, whereby the agonists act as inhibitors of inflammation mediated through prostaglandin receptors, and especially through DP\n1\n receptor and/or the DP\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndotoxins are the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) constituents of the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria. Response to LPS has been shown to involve the activation of different cell populations and to lead to the expression of various inflammatory cytokines that include tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interferon gamma(IFN-γ).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-inflammatory activity of compounds of the invention may be assessed after a LPS challenge using the following protocol:\n\n \n \n \nEight weeks old C3H/HEN mice (IFFA-CREDO, L'arbresle, France) receive an oral treatment with compounds of the invention at e.g., 6 different doses (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 or 3 and 10 mg/kg in 0.5% CMC/0.25% tween-20). Six mice are used by group. Fifteen minutes later, endotoxins (O111: B4 Sigma, 0.3 mg/kg) areintraperitoneally injected. Heparinized whole blood is collected by decapitation. TNFα level is determined in plasma by ELISA (R & D Systems, Abdingdon, UK). Control animals receive 0.5% CMC/0.25% tween-20 (10 ml/kg) as vehicle. Data obtained from experiments are expressed as the mean ± SEM and analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed byDunnett's t-test.\n \nThe activity of the compounds of the invention is expressed as a percentage of inhibition of TNF release and the Inhibitory Dose at 50% of the maximum effect (ID\n50\n) is calculated in mg/kg. Using such an experimental protocol, data are generated to show whether the compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNF alpha in a LPS-challenge model.\n \nThe following additional assays also may be performed to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds of the invention. The compounds may be assessed for efficacy against: edema using a rat paw edema assay as described in e.g., \nChan et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 274: 1531-1537, 1995\n); LPS-induced pyrexia in conscious rats as described in e.g., \nChan et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 274: 1531-1537, 1995\n); LPS-induced pyrexia in conscious squirrel monkeys as described in e.g., \nChan et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 327: 221-225, 1997\n); acute inflammatory hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan in rats as described in e.g., \nBoyce et al. (Neuropharmacology 33: 1609-1611, 1994\n).\n \n\n\n\n\n5.6 In vivo effect on penile corpus cavernosum tissue relaxation.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPenile erection is based on three main physiological events: an increase in the arterial blood flow, a relaxation of the expansive tissue of the corpora carvernosa and the corpus spongiosum, and an obstruction of the venous return by mechanicak compression of the veins caused by the expansive tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPGE 1 is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction to relax smooth muscle and therefore to promote the development of erection. The administration of PGE1 is performed by local injection into the cavernous tissue of the penis. However, PGE1 has a low selectivity for prostanoid receptors and has irritant effects. Selective agonists of EP\n2\n and/or EP\n4\n have been developed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (\n \nWO 9902164\n \n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of compounds of the invention on the relaxation of penile corpus cavernosal tissue strips may be assayed for example in an assay on human or rabbit tissue as described below:\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman tissue procurement\n. Cavernosal tissue is obtained from patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation surgery for treatment of erectile dysfunction. In the operating room, biopsies of the corpora cavernosa are immediately placed in chilled (4 °C) physiologic salt solution and transported to the laboratory. Tissue strips, measuring approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 10 mm, are cut and prepared for organ bath studies.\n \n \nRabbit tissue procurement\n. Adult male New Zealand White rabbits (4.5-5.0 kg) are sedated with ketamine (35 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) and euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg body weight). Following exsanguination, the penis is excised and cleaned by removing the corpus spongiosum and urethra. Corpus cavernosum tissue strips are dissected away from the surrounding tunica albuginea and prepared for organ bath studies.\n \n \nPreparation of compound stock solutions and dose responses\n. PGE\n1\n (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) is stored at-20 °C in solid form until the day of use. Stock solutions are made by adding 1 ml of 70% DMSO to a vial containing 1 mg of PGE\n1\n. Compounds of the invention are dissolved in 1 ml of 70% DMSO, divided into 100 µl aliquots and stored at-20 °C until use. For dose responses in organ baths, stock solutions of PGE\n1\n and compounds of the invention are diluted with 70% DMSO to make the highest concentration and then serially diluted with 2% DMSO for all other doses. In a typical dose response curve, the concentration of DMSO is checked to remain below 0.1 % in the 25 ml bath and to not exceed 0.5% at the highest dose.\n \n \nOrgan bath studies\n. Human or rabbit cavemosal tissue strips are mounted onto a fixed support with silk ties and attached to a tension transducer (model FT03; GrassTelefactor, Astro-Med, Inc. West Warwick, RI) with a rigid metal wire. After mounting, tissue strips are immersed in 25 ml baths of physiologic salt solution (PSS; 118.3 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 0.6 mMMgSO\n4\n, 1.2 mMKH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.5 mMCaCl\n2\n, 25 mMNaHCO\n3\n, 0.026 mM CaNa\n2\nEDTA, 11.1 mM glucose). The solution is gassed with 95% air/5% CO\n2\n to attain a pH of 7.4 and the temperature is maintained at 37 °C. All tissue strips are treated with 3 µM indomethacin to inhibit endogenous prostanoid production and minimize spontaneous contractile activity.\n\nThe corpus cavernosum tissue is stretched incrementally and the optimal resting isometric tension for contraction is determined. After every 3-4 stretches (1 g tension/stretch), the tissue is contracted with 1µM phenylephrine. When the amplitude of the phenylephrine-induced contraction is within 10% of the previous contraction, that tension is considered optimal for isometric contraction. All tissue strips are extensively washed with fresh PSS. Tissue strips are then contracted with 1 µM phenylephrine. After stable tone is achieved, tissue strips are exposed to increasing concentrations of PGE\n1\n or compounds of the invention.\n \n \nData analysis\n. At the end of each experiment, all tissue strips are treated with 10µM papaverine and 10µM nitroprusside to induce maximal relaxation (100%). The total amount of relaxatory response over the range of drug concentrations tested is determined by the area under the plotted curves. EC\n50\n values are calculated using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). For final analysis of data, relaxation parameters are compared using ANOVA. If the ANOVA p-value is less than 0.05, paired post-test comparisons is carried out using the Tukey-Kramer test.\n \nTable 2 summarizes results of the organ bath studies. Compound #1 caused a dose-dependent relaxation of human penile cavemosal tissue strips after contraction with phenylephrine. DP receptor agonist BW245C (reference molecule) caused relaxation with comparable potency (EC\n50\n = 59nM). However, the extent of relaxation (maximal effect) was greater for compound #1 than for BW245C. Both compounds were more potent than PGE\n1\n (EC\n50\n = 210 nM). PGE\n1\n is currently used for men who are unresponsive to PDE5 inhibitors. The endogenous DP receptor agonist PGD\n2\n caused dose-dependent relaxation of human cavemosal tissue through 0.3 µM, but caused contraction at higher concentration. This response profile formed the rationale for further in-vivo evaluation of DP agonists in animals.\n \n\n\n \n \nTable 2:\n Relaxation of human penile cavemosal tissue strips after contraction with phenylephrine\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \n \n \nEC\n50\n [nM]\n \n \n \n \n \n#1\n \n29 nM\n \n \n \nBW 245C\n \n59 nM\n \n \n \nPGE\n1\n \n \n210 nM\n \n \n \nPGD\n2\n \n \n0.3\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nIn vivo experiments (rabbit): Intracavernosal injection\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDP agonists were solubilized in 40 % propylene glycol and administered by intracavernosal injection to deliver the indicated dose in 0.1 ml total volume. Since penile intracavernosal pressure (ICP) is ultimately limited by the systemic arterial pressure (SAP), all erectile responses were normalized by calculating the ration of ICP/SAP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn rabbits, intracaveronsal injections of compound #1 caused either sustained periods of penile tumescence or transient episodes that lasted 1-3 minutes. The arterial pressure remained constant. In one rabbit, repeated and transient episodes of spontaneous penile tumescence were recorded after intracavernosal administration of highest dose (5µg) of compound #1. In a separate animal, intracaveronsal injection of highest dose (5µg) of compound #1 resulted in the recordal of arterial pressure waves that were clearly transmitted into the cavemosal compartment, indicating that the penile resistance arteries were fully dilated. Compared to vehicle (40% propylene glycol), compound #1 consistently caused dose-dependant increases in the ICP/SAP, as determined by the peak response or the \"area-under the curve\" (AUC). Similar pro-erectile responses were also observed in rats. Intracavernosal injection of BW245C in rats resulted in similar pro-erectile activity to compound #1. In rabbits no overt changes in systemic blood pressure were noted after administration of any dose of compound #1. All data suggest that DP1 receptors mediate cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation in multiple species and that intracavernosal administered compound #1 is a potent agonist that shows efficacious activity in initiating erections in humans. Currently, PGE\n1\n is used for men who are unresponsive to PDE5 inhibitors either because extent of local penile tissue damage or because neural damage prevents use of PDE5 inhibitors as a therapeutic option. However, PGE\n1\n causes local fibrotic responses with injection, leading to a gradually increasing severity of cavemosal fibrosis and further dysfunction. Therefore, compound #1 may be used as a useful alternative to intracavernosal injections of prostaglandin E1 (PGE\n1\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n5.7 In vivo effect on bone loss prevention.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe activity of compounds of the invention as a bone anabolic agent can be tested for example in a rat ovariectomy model such as follows. Virgin female Sprague Dawley rats are randomized into treatment groups based on pre-dose body weight measurements. The aim is to achieve approximately the same average body weight for every treatment group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSurgery:\n Animals are sedated with ketamine and xylazine (SOP ST-AEP007). The hair on the dorsal abdominal surface is shaved and prepped for aseptic surgery. A single incision is made along the midline, starting just anterior to the lumbar region of the spine. The underlying musculature on both sides of the dorso-lateral region of the abdomen is exposed. An incision is made through the musculature to gain access to the abdominal cavity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a group of animals (\"Ovx\"), the ovary is located and cut at the junction of the uterine horn and removed. The uterus is replaced and the muscles sutured. Repeat on the contra-lateral side.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a control group of animals (\"Sham\"), the ovaries are located and exteriorized, but not removed. The uterus and ovaries are replaced into the abdominal cavity and the muscles sutured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe muscle layers are closed with suture and the skin incision closed using wound clips.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDosing:\n Dosing is commenced one day after the surgery is performed.\n\nThe animals receive daily subcutaneous injections for 6 weeks following surgery. The doses of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 mg/kg of compounds of the invention are used. A control group receives daily subcutaneous injections of 17 βestradiol (Sigma Chemicals) of 30 µg/kg for 6 weeks following surgery. Control groups of animal (the \"sham\" group and an \"Ovx\" group) are injected s. c. vehicle (saline).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFluorochrome Labels:\n To enable the performance of dynamic histomorphometry, two injections of calcein (10 mg/kg, i. p. ) are given 6 and 2 days prior to the necropsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBody Weights and Clinical Observations:\n Body weights are recorded weekly, beginning one week prior to the commencement of treatment and continuing until the conclusion of the treatment period. In addition, the rats are observed daily for signs of ill health or reaction to treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBlood and Urine Biochemistry:\n An eighteen-hour urine specimen is collected from each animal prior to the sacrifice using metabolic cages. At sacrifice, blood samples are collected from each rat, under inhalation anesthesia (ether) from the retro-orbital sinus. Following parameters are measured in urine and serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nParameter Method:\n Urinary deoxypyridinoline is measured by Immuno-assay (Pyrilinks-D Quidel, Mt. View,CA); Urinary creatinine is measured by COBAS chemistry instrument (Creatinine Reagent Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN); Serum osteocalcin is measured by Immune-assay (Rat OSU IRMA, Immunotopics San Clemente, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nNecropsy:\n Upon completion of dosing and urine/blood collection, animals are euthanized using carbon dioxide asphyxiation. All animals are subjected to the following procedure. Terminal body weights are recorded. A gross examination is performed and a check for abnormalities is performed. The following investigation are performed, as detailed:\n\n \n \n \n \nBone Mineral Density Scans:\n L2-L4 lumbar vertebrae is subjected to DXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan using aPIXImus instrument (Lunar Corp. Madison, WI). Bone mineral content, area and density are determined from the PIXI scan. Bone mineral density measurements by DXA are described in \nFormica et al. 1998, Osteoporosis International, 8 (5), 460-467\n.\n \nRight femur is subject to pQCT (peripheral quantitative computed tomography) scan using a Stratec XCT RM and associated software (StratecMedizinteclmik Gmbh, Pforzheim, Germany. Software version 5.40 C). The femur is scanned at two sites, 20% of the distal femur and 50% of the mid-femur.\n\nThe position is verified using scout views and scan results from one 0.5 mm slice perpendicular to the long axis of the femur shaft is recorded. Total bone mineral content, total bone area, total bone mineral density, trabecular bone mineral content, trabecular bone area and trabecular bone mineral density are analyzed from the scan of the distal femur. For the midshaft femur, total bone mineral content, total bone area, total bone mineral density, cortical bone mineral content, cortical bone area, cortical bone mineral density, periosteal perimeter and endosteal perimeter are analyzed.\n \nBone mineral density measurements by pQCT are described in \nFormica et al. 1998, Osteoporosis International, 8 (5), 460-467\n and in \nTsugeno 2002, Osteoporosis International 13(8), 650-656\n.\n \n \nBiomechanical Testing of Lumbar Vertebrae and Femurs:\n L5 Lumbar vertebra is isolated from L5-L6 and prepared for mechanical testing by removing the vertebral arch and pedicle using a low-speed diamond saw. The cranial and caudal ends of each vertebral body are also removed to produce a vertebral body specimen with two parallel surfaces and a height of approximately 4 mm. The width of the vertebral body in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions is measured using electronic digital calipers. These values are recorded and used in the calculation of cross-sectional area. The height of the vertebral body specimen is also taken with an electronic caliper and recorded. The specimens are then placed between two platens and load applied at a displacement rate of 6 mm/min until failure in an Instron Mechanical Testing Instrument (Instron 4465, retrofitted to 5500).\n \nThe load and displacement are recorded by: Instron Instrument Software (Merlin II, Instron) and the locations for maximum load at failure, stiffness and energy absorbed are selected manually from the load and displacement curve.\n\nThe intrinsic properties, stress, elastic modulus and toughness are then calculated from maximum load, stiffness, energy absorbed, cross-sectional area, and height.\n \nAfter the pQCT scan, the anterior to posterior diameter at the midpoint of the femoral shaft is taken with an electronic caliper and recorded. Femur is then placed on the lower supports of a three point bending fixture with anterior side facing downward in an Instron Mechanical Testing Instrument (Instron 4465, retrofitted to 5500). The span between the two lower supports is set at 14 mm. The upper loading device aligned to the center of the femoral shaft. The load is applied at a constant displacement rate of 6mm/min until the femur breaks. The locations of maximal load, stiffness and energy absorbed are selected manually and values calculated by instrument's software (Merlin II, Instron). The intrinsic properties, stress, elastic modulus and toughness are calculated from maximum load, stiffness, energy absorbed, anterior-posterior diameter, and moment of inertia.\n \nAfter the three point bending test, a 3-mm segment of the distal femoral metaphysis is cut directly proximal to the femoral condyle with a low-speed diamond saw. The load is applied with a cylindrical indenter (with a flat testing face of 1.6 mm diameter (d)) to the center of marrow cavity on the distal face of the segment. The indenter is allowed to penetrate the cavity at a constant displacement rate of 6 mm/min to a depth of 2 mm before load reversal. The locations of maximum load, stiffness and energy absorbed is selected manually from load displacement curve and then calculated by the instrument's software (Merlin II, Instron). Stress is calculated by dividing the maximum load by the indenter area.\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBone Histology and Dynamic Histomorphometry\n:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDehydration, embedding and sectioning\n Formalin-fixed samples of proximal tibia are dehydrated in a series of ascending ethanol concentration. Following dehydration, bone samples are infiltrated and embedded in methyl methacrylate-based plastic. Embedded samples of the proximal tibia are sectioned longitudinally using a Leitz motorized rotary microtome equipped with a tungsten-carbide microtome knife. Once the blocks are trimmed, 4 µm sections are stained with Goldner's trichrome stain for microscopy. The 8 µm sections are left unstained for epifluorescence microscopy.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHistomorphometric determinations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStatic and dynamic histomorphometry of the proximal tibia is performed. The measurement includes the secondary spongiosa (area that is 1.05 from the lowest point of the growth plate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBone histomorphometry is performed using an OsteoMeasure software program (OsteoMetrics, Inc. Atlanta, GA) interfaced with a Nikon Eclipse E400 light/epifluorescent microscope and video subsystem. Histomorphometry is read in a blinded manner. Total tissue area, trabecular bone area, trabecular bone perimeter, and osteoclast perimeter is measured on 4 µm thick Goldner's trichrome stained sections. Percent trabecular bone area, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation and osteoclast perimeter as a percentage of bone surfaces are then calculated according to standardized formulae. For dynamic parameters, single-labeled calcein perimeter, double-labeled calcein perimeter, and interlabel width (label thickness) is measured on 8µm thick unstained sections, and the mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate-surface referent is calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\n5.8 In vivo effect on adjuvant induced arthritis in rats.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds also may be monitored for their efficacy against adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. In an exemplary such assay, female Lewis rats (body weight about 146-170 g) are weighed, ear marked, and assigned to groups (a negative control group in which arthritis is not induced, a vehicle control group, a positive control group administered indomethacin at a total daily dose of 1 mg/kg and four groups administered with a test compound at total daily doses of 0.10-3.0 mg/kg) such that the body weights are equivalent within each group. Six groups of 10 rats are each injected into a hind paw with 0.5 mg of Mycobacterium butyricum in 0.1 mL of light mineral oil (adjuvant), and a negative control group of 10 rats that has not been injected with adjuvant. Body weights, contralateral paw volumes (determined by mercury displacement plethysmography) and lateral radiographs (obtained under Ketamine and Xylazine anesthesia) are determined before (day -1) and 21 days following adjuvant injection, and primary paw volumes are determined before (day - 1) and on days 4 and 21 following adjuvant injection. The rats are anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 0.03-0.1 mL of a combination of Ketamine (87 mg/kg) and Xylazine (13 mg/kg) for radiographs and injection of adjuvant. The radiographs are made of both hind paws on day 0 and day 21 using the Faxitron (45 kVp, 30 seconds) and Kodak X-OMAT TL film, and are developed in an automatic processor. Radiographs are evaluated for changes in the soft and hard tissues by an investigator who is preferably blinded to experimental treatment. The radiographic changes may be graded numerically according to severity e.g., increased soft issue volume (0-4), narrowing or widening of joint spaces (0-5) subehondral erosion (0-3), periosteal reaction (0-4), osteolysis (0-4) subluxation (0-3), and degenerative joint changes (0-3). Specific criteria can be used to establish the numerical grade of severity for each radiographic change. The maximum possible score per foot may be set at a value determined by the investigator, e.g., 26. A test compound at total daily doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day, indomethacin at a total daily dose of 1 mg/kg/day, or vehicle (0.5% methocel in sterile water) are then administered per os b.i.d. beginning post injection of adjuvant and continuing for 21 days. The compounds are prepared weekly, refrigerated in the dark until used, and vortex mixed immediately prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the compositions and/or uses disclosed and claimed herein can be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure. While the compositions and methods of this invention have been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that variations may be applied to the compositions and/or methods and in the steps or in the sequence of steps of the method described herein.
