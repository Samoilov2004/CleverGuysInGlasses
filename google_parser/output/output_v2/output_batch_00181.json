    "text": "Sh2 domain profiling to characterize tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in cancer AbstractA phosphoproteomic method termed SH2 profiling to characterize phosphotyrosine (pTyr) signaling in lung cancer. This method provides quantitative values for the phosphorylated binding sites for Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains, which the cell uses to relay signals from tyrosine kinases. Lung cancer cell lines with known mutational status of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ras were profiled. Changes in SH2 domain binding were characterized in response to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, and the SRC/multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Cell lines grouped based on SH2 binding patterns. Clusters correlated with EGFR mutation status or MET activation. Binding of specific SH2 domains correlated with EGFR mutation and erlotinib sensitivity. SH2 domain profiling identifies subsets of lung cancer cells with distinct patterns of pTyr signaling and provides a powerful molecular diagnostic tool for classification and biomarker identification. This analysis has therapeutic importance for personalized use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer. Claims\n\n\n\n\nWhat is claimed is: \n\n\n\n\n 1.

The Government has certain rights in the invention. \n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n This application claims priority to currently pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 /242,423, entitled, \"Characterizing Tyrosine Phosphorylation Signaling in Lung Cancer Using SH2 Domain Profiling\", filed September 15, 2009, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION \n\n\n This invention relates to cancer therapy. More specifically, this invention relates to classification and biomarker identification in cancer cells leading to tailored cancer diagnosis and therapy. \n\n\n BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nLung cancer accounts for over 160,000 deaths per year in the U.S., more than breast, colon, prostate and pancreatic cancer combined [Jemal A, et al., Cancer statistics, 2008. CA Cancer J Clin (2008) 58: 71 -96]. There is therefore an important unmet need to better identify key drivers of lung cancer that can be therapeutically exploited. Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases represent an important class of drug targets for the treatment of lung cancer. These key signaling proteins regulate many activities important for cancer, including cell proliferation, survival, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis [Blume-Jensen P, et al., Nature (2001 ) 41 1 : 355-65]. In lung cancer, the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently elevated, and this can drive numerous downstream signaling pathways responsible for lung cancer growth and survival. Inhibition of EGFR through the small molecule inhibitor erlotinib can extend survival in patients with advanced lung cancer refractory to chemotherapy [Shepherd FA, et al. N Engl J Med (2005) 353: 123-32]. \n\n Eriotinib is representative of a large class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) now being developed. In addition to EGFR, a number of other important tyrosine kinases have been proposed as therapeutic targets in lung cancer. These include MET receptors, insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGFR), SRC kinases, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ephrin (EPH) receptors, and others [Rikova K, et al. Cell (2007) 131 : 1 190-203; Davies H, et al. Cancer Res (2005) 65: 7591 -5; Johnson FM, et al, Clin Cancer Res (2005) 1 1 : 6924-32; Morgillo F, et al, Clin Cancer Res (2007) 13: 2795-803; Puri N, et al. Cancer Res (2007) 67: 3529-34; Song L, et al. Cancer Res (2006) 66: 5542-8; Soda M, et al. Nature (2007) 448: 561 -6; Brannan JM, et al, Clin Cancer Res (2009) 15: 4423-30; Fischer H, et al, Mol Cancer Ther (2008) 7: 3408-19]. \n\n\n Despite the promise shown by TKIs for the treatment of lung cancer, it has been difficult to predict which patients will benefit from these new drugs. This is an important parameter to resolve because a large group of patients receiving TKIs receive no benefit from treatment and costs of these agents are substantial. The present invention addresses this shortcoming, along with a number of other unresolved needs in the effective treatment of cancer, as will become apparent. \n\n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a critical role in driving the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. A novel phosphoproteomic method, termed \"SH2 profiling\", has been applied to characterize phosphotyrosine (pTyr) signaling in lung cancer. This method provides quantitative values for the phosphorylated binding sites for Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains, which are used by the cell to relay signals from tyrosine kinases. To validate the method, lung cancer cell lines with known mutational status of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ras were profiled. Changes in SH2 domain binding were characterized in response to the EGFR inhibitor eriotinib and the SRC/multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. The results show cell lines could be grouped based on SH2 binding patterns and that some clusters correlated with EGFR mutation status or MET activation. Binding of specific SH2 domains, most prominently the Ras pathway activators Grb2 and ShcA, correlated with EGFR mutation and eriotinib sensitivity. Groups of SH2 domains were responsive to eriotinib or dasatinib, suggesting both common core and unique pTyr signaling affected by these inhibitors. Finally, the results show that SH2 domain profiles can identify lung cancer cells driven by cooperative EGFR and MET signaling as well as by PDGFR signaling. Accordingly, SH2 domain profiling can identify subsets of lung cancer cells with distinct patterns of pTyr signaling and provides a powerful molecular diagnostic tool for classification and biomarker \n\n identification.

Roughly 100 tyrosine kinases have been identified in the human genome. [Koomen, JM et al., Mol Cell Proteomics, (2008) 7(10) :1780-94]. Some of the tyrosine kinases are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, while others may have an undiscovered role. The tryrosine kinases targeted for therapy include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET receptors, insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGFR), SRC kinases, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ephrin (EPH) receptors, and others. \n\n\nA key question in the field of tyrosine kinase therapy for lung cancer is which patients will benefit from these new drugs, an important consideration since a large group of patients receive no benefit from treatment and costs of these agents are substantial. An important breakthrough was the discovery of activating somatic mutations in EGFR that enhance receptor signaling and predict sensitivity to TKIs that target the EGFR, such as erlotinib and gefitinib [Lynch TJ, et al., N Engl J Med (2004) 350: 2129-39; Paez JG, et al., Science (2004) 304: 1497-500; Pao W, et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A (2004) 101 :13306-1 1 ]. In patients who harbor these mutations, response rates to EGFR TKIs can be high and the survival of patients is better than that seen with cytotoxic agents [Sequist LV, et al, J Clin Oncol (2008) 26:2442-9]. Nonetheless, some patients who do not have EGFR mutation can still benefit from EGFR inhibitors, and markers such as EGFR gene amplification, autocrine TGFD production, or gene expression profiles could identify these subsets of lung cancer patients [Cappuzzo F, et al, J Natl Cancer Inst (2005) 97: 643-55; Balko JM, et al, BMC genomics\n\n\n(2006) 7: 289; Yonesaka K, et al, Clin Cancer Res (2008) 14: 6963-73]. In addition, resistance mechanisms such as secondary mutations in EGFR or MET amplification can rapidly lead to drug resistance and tumor growth [Bean J, et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\n\n\n(2007) 104:20932-7; Engelman JA, et al. Science (2007) 316:1039-43; Pao W, et al, PLoS Med (2005) 2:1 -1 1 ]. Finally, some tumor cells are likely to be driven by multiple tyrosine kinases, and methods to identify these cooperative drivers of signaling is critical [Stommel JM, et al. Science (2007) 318: 287-90]. \n\n\nProteomic strategies, which examine global patterns of protein expression or phosphorylation, can be used to identify subsets of tumors [Kikuchi T, et al, Respirology (2007) 12:22-8]. Mass spectrometry coupled with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies can be used to identify different patterns of tyrosine kinase signaling in lung cancer cells and tumors. This approach was used to identify cells driven by oncogenic EGFR, PDGFR, and ALK [Rikova K, et al. Cell (2007) 131 : 1 190-203]. Other studies using the same approach found patterns of tyrosine \n\n phosphorylation associated with mutant EGFR signaling [Guha U, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A {2008) 105:141 12-7; Guo A, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A (2008) 105:692-7]. It is shown herein that the characterization of global tyrosine phosphorylation patterns can provide key information for classifying lung cancers and demonstrates that multiple kinases can be active in a single cancer cell. \n\n\nAs a complement to cataloguing tyrosine phosphorylated proteins using MS-based approaches, a novel phosphoproteomic method, termed \"SH2 profiling\", can be used to profile phosphotyrosine (pTyr) signaling in cancer cells [Dierck K, et al., Nat Methods (2006) 3:737-44; Machida K, et al., Mol Ce// (2007) 26: 899-915]. SH2 profiling uses the cell's own phosphotyrosine signal response apparatus to interrogate the state of pTyr signaling. One of the most important consequences of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is regulation of protein- protein interactions [Pawson T., Cell (2004) 1 16:191 -203(29)] Many tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins serve as high-affinity binding sites for proteins containing modular pTyr-specific binding domain, which serve to couple tyrosine phosphorylation to the assembly of signaling complexes and the relocalization of signaling proteins. By far the most abundant such module in humans is the Src Homology 2 or SH2 domain [Machida K, and Mayer BJ., Biochim Biophys Acta Proteins and Proteomics (2005) 1747:1 -25]. There are 120 SH2 domains encoded by the human genome and each SH2 domain has binding specificity for a unique spectrum of tyrosine phosphorylated sites [Liu BA, et al., Mol Cell (2006) 22: 851 -68; Machida K, et al., Mol Cell (2007) 26: 899-915]. Because SH2 domains are what the cell actually uses to respond to or \"read\" changes in tyrosine phosphorylation during signaling, the extent of binding of different SH2 domains to a cell sample can provide a great deal of information about the signaling state and its underlying mechanisms. Differences in SH2 profiles (and therefore pTyr signaling) were discernable in cells transformed by distinct oncogenic tyrosine kinases, and allowed classification of different types of leukemia [Dierck K, et al., Nat Methods (2006) 3:737-44; Machida K, et al., Mol Cell (2007) 26: 899-915]. \n\n\n SH2 profiling provides a tool to characterize and classify complex tumor types, such as lung cancer, where multiple tyrosine kinases drive downstream signaling pathways and maintain tumor growth. SH2 profiling is applied herein to lung cancer cells to show that patterns of pTyr could be identified and related to known features of the cells including EGFR mutation status and sensitivity to EGFR TKI. Changes in SH2 domain binding (and therefore pTyr signaling) were examined in cells treated with either EGFR or SRC TKI. Finally, we show SH2 domain binding patterns can identify cells driven by RTK other than EGFR. Thus, SH2 profiling itself provides a means to classify tumors for prediction/prognosis, and allows for screening to identify specific biomarkers that might be more amenable to a clinical test. \n\n\nOverview \n\n Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a critical role in driving the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. SH2 profiling was applied to characterize phosphotyrosine (pTyr) signaling in lung cancer. This method provides quantitative values for the phosphorylated binding sites for Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains, which are used by the cell to relay signals from tyrosine kinases. Lung cancer cell lines with known mutational status of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ras were profiled. Changes in SH2 domain binding were characterized in response to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, and the SRC/multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. The results show that cell lines could be grouped based on SH2 binding patterns, and that some clusters correlated with EGFR mutation status or MET activation. Binding of specific SH2 domains, most prominently the Ras pathway activators Grb2 and ShcA, correlated with EGFR mutation and erlotinib sensitivity. Groups of SH2 domains were responsive to erlotinib or dasatinib, suggesting both common core and unique pTyr signaling affected by these inhibitors. Finally, the results show that SH2 domain profiles can identify lung cancer cells driven by cooperative EGFR and MET signaling as well as by PDGFR signaling. The results indicate that SH2 domain profiling can identify subsets of lung cancer cells with distinct patterns of pTyr signaling and provide a powerful molecular diagnostic tool for classification and biomarker identification. This type of analysis has therapeutic importance for personalized use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer. \n\n\n The results demonstrate that SH2 domains are useful as a biomarker for response to EGFR TKI, that they give additional biologic and mechanistic insights into mutant EGFR biology, that SH2 domains can serve as the basis for classification of tumors with potential prognostic and/or predictive value, and that SH2 domains can provide insights into driver tyrosine kinases and hierarchy of tyrosine kinases that provide growth and/or survival signals in lung cancer cells. \n\n\n One important observation was that patterns of pTyr signaling (as measured by SH2 profiling) appear driven by EGFR mutation. Higher binding was found in EGFR mutant cells with Brk, Grap2, Grb2, ShcA, and Txk SH2 domains. These results, using cell lines that originated from different patients, show that binding sites for a group of SH2 domains are consistently increased in cells with activating EGFR mutations. Nonetheless, it was also observed that mutant EGFR does not drive the entire tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in lung cancer cells, as cells with mutant EGFR can form distinct clusters. The rich abundance of tyrosine kinases (MET, IGFR, SRC, ALK, and PDGFR, etc.) involved in the biology of lung cancer may explain these results. This global characterization is consistent with the distinct mutant allelles of EGFR leading to measurable differences in tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. SH2 profiling therefore reveals heterogeneity of signaling despite common genomic properties (EGFR mutation) and provides additional predictive or prognostic information in tumor classification. \n\n Classification based on SH2 profiles correlated closely with two other molecular markers, such as MET activation and K-RAS activation. In the case of MET, both rosette and far- western SH2 profiling clearly distinguished a cluster of cells with MET activation (assayed by activating phosphorylation and p85 SH2 binding). Therefore, in lung cancer, global changes in tyrosine phosphorylation are likely to be at least as dependent on MET signaling as they are on EGFR activation. This result is an indication of the value of nonbiased, global proteomic approaches for analysis of cancer. Second, far-western-based SH2 profiling showed a strong correlation between pTyr pattern and activating K-Ras mutations. This is somewhat surprising, as one might think that constitutive Ras activation would render cells independent of pTyr-based signals, e.g. from activated receptors. The fact that K-Ras mutant cells cluster together indicates that there are common patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation associated with cells in which Ras activity is decoupled from receptor activation, perhaps through feedback loops that normally down-regulate pTyr signaling after Ras activation. \n\n\n Data obtained through SH2 profiling can generate additional insights regarding the biology of EGFR mutations. For example, the present analysis identified specific HSH2 SH2 domain binding to EGFR on far western (FIG. 2C) yet this interaction has not been reported in lung cancer cells. Tyrosine phosphorylated peptides on HSH2 have been identified in lung cancer cells with activating EGFR mutations. In addition, HSH2 tyrosine phosphorylation is a feature in cells stimulated with EGF. HSH2 modulates apoptotic response through mitochondrial signaling and thus could have a hitherto unknown role in EGFR mediated survival. Little evidence exists for a role of TXK in lung cancer, with prior data linking it to expression in T- cells. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the reduction in CSK SH2 domain binding to mutant EGFR could explain SRC activation in these cells and hypersensitivity of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells to SRC TKI. \n\n\n The present results also indicate that SH2 domains can be used as a biomarker for EGFR TKI sensitivity. Signaling from EGFR can be mediated by different mechanisms including activating mutations, overexpression, and autocrine stimulation. A key event is coupling of EGFR activation to downstream signaling events via protein tyrosine phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domain containing proteins. Fourteen SH2 domains are shown whose binding correlated with erlotinib sensitivity and reflect engagement of downstream MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. It is significant that binding sites for known Ras pathway activators, Grb2 and She, are associated both with activating EGFR mutations and with erlotinib sensitivity. Ras activation is associated with proliferative signals, and Ras itself is activated by mutation in a large number of human cancers. By examining pTyr signaling in an unbiased fashion on a global scale, these results evidence the central importance of Ras signaling in lung cancer, and indicate that particularly strong activation of Ras provides a hallmark of cancers driven by EGF receptor mutants, and of those that are \n\n most likely to respond to EGFR inhibitors. Thus, SH2 domains could be used to read upstream EGFR activity occurring through diverse mechanisms. Further work with SH2 domains will provide additional information beyond known predictors of EGFR TKI response, such as EGFR mutation status, gene amplification, gene expression profiles, autocrine signaling. Such work can be accompanied by evaluation in animal tumor models or human specimens. \n\n\n Importantly, SH2 domain profiling can directly interrogate signal transduction by diverse tyrosine kinases. Similarly to the key roles for RTK, other than EGFR in lung cancer, for example MET, ALK, and PDGFRD , SH2 profiles are useful as a global assay to define kinase dependency. SH2 profiling interrogates the entire tyrosine kinome, as opposed to approaches where each component must be assayed individually. Furthermore, it provides a read-out of the actual in vivo activity of all tyrosine kinases in the cell, in their native milieu. In other words, rather than having to assay for expression/amplification/mutation of multiple tyrosine kinases, SH2 profiles reveal strong signaling emanating from multiple kinases. The analysis taught herein finds examples of cells driven both by EGFR and MET that would require dual EGFR and MET blockage for abrogation of downstream signaling. Treatment with either EGFR or MET TKI alone resulted in modest reductions in phosphorylated AKT, while combined treatment with both agents resulted in complete inhibition of phosphorylated Akt along with more substantial inhibition of cell growth compared to either agent alone. As with the H820 cell, SH2 domains can also interrogate potential resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKI by identifying activation of other RTK (MET). In addition to EGFR and MET, SH2 domain profiling also identified cells dependent on PDGFR. Thus, information provided by far WB using SH2 probes can be useful for guiding therapeutic decisions. \n\n\n SH2 profiling can be applied to human tumor samples to evaluate the similarity of patterns observed in lung cancer cell lines. SH2 profiling adds additional information reflecting tyrosine kinase signaling that is prognostic or predictive of response to TKI. With the current approach using rosette assays, it is possible to profile the level of binding for virtually all SH2 domains in the genome using minimal amounts of protein sample (less than 100 micrograms total protein). A multiplexed SH2 profiling platform, based on tagging of SH2 domains with specific oligonucleotides, has also been developed and validated. After binding of probes to immobilized sample and washing, oligonucleotides are amplified by linear polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantified. The PCR amplification step makes the assay extremely sensitive, and this platform provides one basis for a standardized clinical SH2 profiling assay for molecular diagnostics. \n\n\n SH2 profiling can be evaluated against other current methods for analyzing global tyrosine phosphorylation patterns. Currently, the use of phosphospecific antibodies and mass \n\n spectrometry are most prevalent. Phosphospecific antibodies (to specific tyrosine phosphorylated sites) can be sensitive and specific, but have the disadvantage that they require knowledge of the relevant phosphorylated sites, and they are available and validated for only a small fraction of known sites. Mass spectrometry (with or without initial enrichment by pull-down or immunoprecipitation) can be used to identify specific phosphorylated sites in a sample, but has the disadvantages that coverage and sensitivity are modest, relatively large amounts of sample are required, and absolute quantification of individual sites is difficult. Compared to these approaches, SH2 profiling combines the benefits of being comprehensive, highly sensitive, and quantitative. In addition, the limited number of SH2 domains in human genome (-100) reduces the computational complexity and reagent cost. \n\n\nThus, SH2 domains can recognize distinct patterns of EGFR signaling in lung cancer cells, but also provide additional ability to classify tumors beyond EGFR mutation status. A set of SH2 domains is correlated with EGFR TKI sensitivity and is useful in reading EGFR signaling in human tumors. In addition to EGFR, SH2 domains can also identify tumor cells dependent on MET and PDGFR for control of downstream signaling events. These results are important in therapeutic decisions regarding TKI in lung cancer and provide an additional approach to tumor classification. \n\n\n Exemplary Indications, Conditions.

Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present disclosure. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. \n\n\n Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Furthermore, when numerical ranges of varying scope are set forth herein, it is contemplated that any combination of these values inclusive of the recited values may be used. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"comprising\" is intended to mean that the products, compositions and methods include the referenced components or steps, but not excluding others. \"Consisting essentially of\" when used to define products, compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other components or steps of any essential significance.

In reference to cancers or other unwanted cell proliferation, an effective amount comprises an amount sufficient to cause a tumor to shrink and/or to decrease the growth rate of the tumor (such as to suppress tumor growth) or to prevent or delay other unwanted cell proliferation. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to delay development. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to prevent or delay occurrence and/or recurrence. An effective amount can be administered in one or more doses. In the case of cancer, the effective amount of the drug or composition may: (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; (vi) prevent or delay occurrence and/or recurrence of tumor; and/or (vii) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. \n\n\nThe term \"treating cancer\" or \"treatment of cancer\" refers to administration to a mammal afflicted with a cancerous condition and refers to an effect that alleviates the cancerous condition by killing the cancerous cells, but also to an effect that results in the inhibition of growth and/or metastasis of the cancer. \n\n\n As used herein, \"treatment\" refers to obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results.

The methods of the invention contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment. \n\n\n A \"subject in need of treatment\" is a mammal with cancer that is life-threatening or that impairs health or shortens the lifespan of the mammal. \n\n\n A \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" component is one that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. \n\n\n A \"safe and effective amount\" refers to the quantity of a component that is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. \n\n\n\"Therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount of a compound of the present invention alone or an amount of the combination of compounds claimed or an amount of a compound of the present invention in combination with other active ingredients effective to treat the diseases described herein. \n\n\n As used in relation to the invention, the term \"treating\" or \"treatment\" and the like should be taken broadly. They should not be taken to imply that a subject is treated to total recovery. Accordingly, these terms include amelioration of the symptoms or severity of a particular condition or preventing or otherwise reducing the risk of further development of a particular condition. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"pretreating\", or \"pretreatment\", is intended to mean that a first treatment is administered prior to, or in conjunction with, a second treatment.

Murray, The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, N.J.). \n\n\n The invention is described below in examples which are intended to further describe the invention without limitation to its scope. \n\n\n Example 1 - Global SH2 domain profiles identifies subsets of lung cancer cell lines \n\n\nA group of 22 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with known EGFR mutation status, K-Ras mutation status, MET activation status, and sensitivity to EGFR TKI erlotinib was selected for study (Table 1 and Figures 20 and 21 ). The overall approach for the studies is shown in FIG. 1. Two approaches to generate SH2 profiles were examined. The first uses a reverse-phase (RP) protein array method in which multiple protein samples are spotted in arrays in register with the wells of a 96-well chamber apparatus. Each well is then filled with a solution containing a different GST-SH2 domain probe, and after incubation and washing, the bound probe is detected by chemiluminescence and quantified. The quantitative value for binding of the GST-SH2 probe depends both on the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated binding sites for that SH2 domain present in the sample, and on the affinity of those sites. With this rapid and quantitative approach, which we term the \"rosette\" assay, it is possible to profile the level of binding for virtually all SH2 domains in the genome using minimal amounts of protein sample. \n\n Table 1 \n\n\n IC50(nM)\n\n\nRAS IC\n50\n(n ) of of\n\n\nCell Histology EGFR Status Status Other Erlotinib Dasatinib\n\n\nHCC827 Adeno del exon 19 WT 3.69\n*\n 57.2\n\n\nPC9 Adeno del exon 19 WT 7.5\n*\n 244.5\n\n\nH4006 Adeno del exon 19 WT 2.79* 137.7 \n\n\n PTEN \n\n\n H1650 Adeno del exon 19 WT loss 12700 2000\n\n\nH1975 Adeno L858R/T790M WT T790M 5600 329.7 \n\n\n HER3 \n\n\n H2279 Adeno del exon 19 WT loss 5300 62.7 \n\n\n T790M, \n\n\n H820 Adeno del exon 19 WT MET >2000 61 .6\n\n\nH292 Squamous WT WT 28.4\n\n\nH358 BAC WT Mut exonl 199.1 27.4\n\n\nH441 Adeno WT Mut exon2 6290 >2000\n\n\nA549 Adeno WT Mut exonl 10970 413.3\n\n\nH460 Large Cell WT Mut exon2 8880 >2000\n\n\nH1299 Large Cell WT WT 8300 31 .6\n\n\nH1648 Adeno WT WT 75.8\n\"\n 20.9\n\n\nH2122 Adeno WT Mut exonl 747.8 485.5\n\n\nH226 Squamous WT WT 45400 708.7\n\n\nH157 Squamous WT Mut exonl 19600 48.9\n\n\nH322 BAC WT WT \n:::::::\n 1 1 .6\n\n\nH23 Adeno WT Mut exonl 7800 >2000\n\n\nH596 Adeno/Squam WT WT 5000 77.9\n\n\nH2172 ?

The mean values for four replicate spots (from at least two separate experiments) were used for clustering analysis. Results are shown in heat map format in FIG. 2. Data with low signal/background were discarded, and remaining data were normalized; darkly shaded boxes indicate higher than average binding, darkly shaded boxes lower than average. A web- based viewer for these data was also developed. Note that cell lines harboring mutant EGFR cluster together in distinct sub-clusters, while two large clusters consist entirely of cells with wildtype (wt) EGFR. In addition, a cluster of cells with MET activation that co-cluster amongst the cells with EGFR mutations was found. These results evidence that SH2 domain profiles can identify subsets of lung cancer cells, and that such clusters correlate to EGFR mutation and MET activation status. \n\n The second approach uses far-Western blotting to obtain more detailed information about the relative abundance and size of phosphoproteins that bind different SH2 domain probes. In this approach, protein samples are separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis and transferred to membranes, which are then probed with labeled SH2 domains. SH2 binding proteins are revealed as bands, and the apparent molecular weight of these bands may suggest their identity. We developed software tools that allow SH2 binding data from far- western blots to be quantified in \"bins\" by apparent molecular weight, e.g. 20 distinct bins per lane. The data from each bin (corresponding to phosphoproteins of a particular molecular weight range that bind to the SH2 probe) can then be used as the basis for classification of samples. Thus, instead of a single value for each sample and SH2 domain, as in the rosette assay, quantitative far-Western blotting provides at least 20 different data points, greatly increasing the potential discrimination between tumor samples. \n\n\n When this type of analysis was applied to NSCLC cell lines (FIG. 3), the samples clustered into 3 distinct classes, plus two outliers. One of the clusters (cluster 3) consists entirely of cells with wt EGFR. In contrast, clusters 1 and 2 are enriched for cells that have EGFR mutations; within each of these clusters, cells with wt and mutant EGFR are clearly segregated. These data indicate that SH2 profiling data can functionally classify lung cancers, and predict EGFR mutation status. \n\n\n We also compared clustering based on SH2 profiling with other known biological properties of these cell lines including sensitivity to erlotinib and dasatinib and K-Ras mutation status, as activating mutations in K-Ras occur frequently in lung cancer and could be important for targeted therapy efficacy. A number of interesting features are apparent. For example, in both the rosette and far-western assays, two core clusters of cell lines with wt EGFR are apparent (one consisting of H157, HH460, H1299, and UK29, the other of H292, H322, H596, and H2172). The first of these consists entirely of cell lines resistant to erlotinib, and may represent a wt, resistant pTyr phenotype. The second group contains cell lines both sensitive to and resistant to erlotinib, and thus represents a phosphorylation pattern associated with erlotinib sensitivity despite apparently wt EGFR status. Second, there is an interesting apparent correlation between clustering based on SH2 profiles and K-RAS mutation status. This is particularly clear in the case of far-western blotting, where two major clusters consist entirely of cells with wt K-Ras, whereas a third major cluster consists almost entirely of cells with wt EGFR but mutant K-Ras. All cell lines in this cluster are resistant to erlotinib. These data suggest tyrosine phosphorylation patterns can sub-classify cells with wt EGFR based on Ras mutation status. \n\n\n Further analysis of SH2 binding patterns in far-western blots revealed a number of interesting relationships. For example, the H358 and H441 cells cluster tightly; the H358 cell is sensitive \n\n to EGFR TKI while the H441 generally is resistant. The similarity in SH2 profiles suggests that both have active EGFR signaling but some other component of signal transduction maintains H441 cell growth in the presence of EGFR inhibition. Second, the H820 and H1648 cells cluster tightly. The H820 cell has an activating EGFR mutation coupled with MET amplification [Bean J, et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2007) 104: 20932-7. The H1648 cell has wt EGFR and has also been recently shown to have MET amplification [Nakamura Y, et al., Cancer science (2008) 99: 14-22]. These results suggest that in these particular cell lines, downstream signaling may be driven by both EGFR and MET. Finally, a third cluster consists of H2279, H1650. and H1975 cells that harbor activating EGFR mutations but are insensitive to EGFR TKI. H1975 has a secondary gatekeeper mutation (T790M) that results in drug insensitivity while H1 650 was recently shown to have PTEN loss [Pao W, et al., PLoS Med (2005) 2: e73; Sos ML, et al., Cancer research (2009) 69: 3256-61 ]. Nonetheless, these results may also suggest other mechanisms of resistance in these cells. \n\n\n Inspection of actual far-western blotting results provides clues to the identity of some major SH2 binding sites. Grb2, Grb7, HSHS2, and Vav2 SH2 domains appear relatively specific for the H ER family bands at approximately ~194 kD. GAP SH2 domains appear to bind ~145 kD bands likely representing activated MET. The P85 SH2 domains bind both H ER and MET bands consistent with known roles of these kinases in control of PI3K/Akt signaling [Stommel JM, et al. Science (2007) 318: 287-90]. \n\n\n Example 2 - A set of SH2 probes demonstrates enhanced binding in cells harboring activating EGFR mutations and MET activation \n\n\n Studies were then conducted to investigate if any probes are highly associated with cells harboring activating EGFR mutations. Such probes could in the future serve as the basis for simpler molecular diagnostic tests. Eight SH2 domains corresponding to 7 proteins were identified that were statistically significant in relation to EGFR mutation status in rosette binding experiments. These include Brk, Grap2, Grb2, Grb2 (SH23) (which contains Grb2 SH3 domains in addition to the SH2), ShcA, Cbl, CbIB and Txk (FIGS. 4-6; Tables 2 and 3). To examine the biological significance of these results, these domains were input into PPI Spider, a tool for interpreting proteomics data in the context of protein-protein interaction networks (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppispider/). This analysis finds 3 proteins (ShcA, Grb2, and Brk) with reported direct interactions to EGFR while Grap2 is potentially linked to EGFR signaling through ShcA (FIG. 22). The fact that binding sites for Grb2 and ShcA, in addition to the close Grb2 relative Grap2, are closely associated with EGFR inhibition is significant, as increased binding of these SH2 domains is predicted to lead to the direct activation of the Ras signaling pathway [Gale NW, et al. Nature (1993) 363: 88-92; Rozakis-Adcock M, et al., Nature (1992) 360: 689-92]. Thus, the results from the global SH2 \n\n profiling capture known interactions with EGFR signaling providing biological validation and relevance to the results. \n\n\nTable 2 \n\n\nEGFR Mutant-related SH2 Domains \n\n\nSH 2 Domai n D val ue c I val ue \n\n\n Grb2 0.001 0.023 \n\n\n ShcA(ptb) 0.001 0.023 \n\n\n Grap2 0.006 0.085 \n\n\n Brk 0.009 0.085 \n\n\n Txk 0.009 0.085 \n\n\n CbI B 0.011 0.085 \n\n\n CbIA 0.011 0.085 \n\n\nA similar analysis was performed using data obtained from far-western blotting of specific SH2 domain probes. Specific bands on far-western blots were found to correlate significantly with mutant EGFR (FIG. 7). It is interesting to consider bands whose binding tends to increase in EGFR mutant cells (dark shaded) versus those whose binding tends to decrease in EGFR mutants (light shaded). For all probes predicted a priori to be associated with stimulation of the Ras pathway (Grb2 and She), bands with increased binding are seen for EGFR mutant cells, while probes predicted to be associated with downregulation of tyrosine kinase signaling, including CbIB (a ubiquitin E3 ligase that ubiquitinates tyrosine phosphorylated substrates and targets them for lysosomal degradation), Csk (the kinase that inhibits Src family kinases), RAS-GAP (which inactivates Ras) and Shp2 (a tyrosine phosphatase that inactivates Stat3 signaling), bands with decreased binding are associated with EGFR mutation. \n\n\n A similar analysis was performed examining SH2 domains correlated with MET phosphorylation. Fourty-nine SH2 domains were found associated with MET phosphorylation (FIG. 8). \n\n Table 3 \n\n\n Met Activation-related SH2 Domains \n\n\n SH2 Domain D value a value SH2 Domain D value a value \n\n\n Sue 0.000006 0 000060 Hck 0.003310 0.006073\n\n\nLck 0.000006 0 000060 Chi men n1 0.003694 0.006326 p85b(NC) 0.000006 0 000060 Csk 0.003713 0.006326\n\n\nSH P-2(NC) 0.000006 0 000060 Fes 0.007002 0.011518\n\n\nCrkL 0.000006 0 000060 Fer 0.008521 0.013549\n\n\nShi 2 0.000013 0 000085 Fy nB 0.009478 0.014583\n\n\nArg 0.000013 0 000085 SH2-B 0.010251 0.015281\n\n\nAbl 0.000025 0 000149 Sh3bp2 0.012680 0.018329\n\n\nLnk 0.000044 0 000209 Plcg2(NC) 0.015943 0.022367\n\n\n\\&v1 0.000044 0 000209 Cten 0.018504 0.025218\n\n\nSH P-2(N) 0.000151 0 00051 5 Grb7 0.019652 0.026038\n\n\nYes 0.000151 0 00051 5 atk/Lsk 0.026498 0.033262\n\n\nFy nA 0.000151 0 00051 5 ShcA(ptb) 0.026498 0.033262\n\n\nPlcgl(NC) 0.000151 0 00051 5 ShcD 0.037048 0.045313\n\n\nSck/ShcB 0.000173 0 000526 Mist/Gink 0.042149 0.050263\n\n\nShcA 0.000198 0 000526 GST 0.047278 0.054050\n\n\nGap(SH23) 0.000199 0 000526 HSh2 0.047592 0.054050 p55g(NC) 0.000199 0 000526 CbIC 0.051 620 0.057262 p85a(NC) 0.000260 0 00061 9 Grb2(SH23) 0.059374 0.064004\n\n\nGk 0.000260 0 00061 9 Fg r 0.060381 0.064004\n\n\nEat 2 0.000726 0 001575 SH E 0.065128 0.067535\n\n\n\\fev2 0.000726 0 001575 Grap2 0.070420 0.071469\n\n\nPtk70/Srms 0.001176 0 002439 Slp76 0.094116 0.092497\n\n\nNap4 0.001 500 0 002982 Grb2 0.095018 0.092497\n\n\nBrk 0.002896 0 005525 Rin 1 0.108630 0. 103632 \n\n\nSH2 domains that correlate with Ras mutation status were also examined. In contrast to EGFR mutation and MET phosphorylation, no SH2 domains were found correlating with Ras mutation status. This could be secondary to predominant serine and threonine phosphorylation downstream of Ras signaling or lack of statistical power. \n\n\n Example 3 - A set of SH2 probes is correlated with sensitivity of lung cancer cells to EGFR TKI \n\n\n The correlation of a set of SH2 domain binding with sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines to eriotinib was investigated. For each cell line, data from rosette assays and far-western blotting were examined in relationship to the IC\n50\n for eriotinib. These assays were performed with the actual cell lines used for profiling, at the same time and under the same culture conditions. This was performed as an exploratory analysis given that the sample size was low (22 cell lines), confounding effects of EGFR mutation (which is an independent predictor of \n\n sensitivity), and cells were included that possess EGFR activation yet are nonetheless resistant because of other alterations (gatekeeper mutation (H1975), PTEN loss (H 1650), and MET amplification (H820)). \n\n\n Fourteen probes were identified corresponding to 12 proteins correlated with eriotinib IC\n50\n (Tables 4 and 5). These include Grb2, Grb2 (SH23), ShcA, ShcA (ptb), p85B (NC), Cis1 , Arg, Eat2. Plcgi (NC), Ptk70/Srms, Fes, Lnk, Tem6, and Btk. Network analysis confirms reports of direct interactions between EGFR and Grb2, ShcA, p85B. Cis1 , Arg, Plcgi , Fes, and Btk (FIG. 1 1 ). The results are consistent with a model where eriotinib sensitivity is associated with particularly strong signaling from activated EGFR to two core downstream effector pathways: MAPK (Grb2 and ShcA) and PI3K/Akt (p85B). Enhanced Grb2 and ShcA SH2 binding was observed both in context of EGFR mutation and eriotinib sensitivity. Finally, use of far western with the SH2 probes also identifies patterns that correlated with eriotinib sensitivity (FIG. 12). While in principle the analysis could be confounded by cells with EGFR mutation, which independently predicts sensitivity, a number of cells that are resistant to eriotinib despite having activating EGFR mutations (H1975, H820, H2279, and H1650) were included in the analysis, as were cell lines with wild-type EGFR that are sensitive to eriotinib (H292, H358, H 1648, H2122, and H322). Thus, it does not appear that EGFR mutation is solely driving this signature. \n\n\nTable 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tern 6 0, 50\n\n\nBtk 0.53 \n\n Example 4 - SH2 domain binding characterizes global tyrosine phosphorylation state perturbed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors \n\n\n SH2 domain profiling was examined to investigate changes in global tyrosine phosphorylation in cells exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Four lung cancer cell lines (H292, H441 , H358 and HCC827) were briefly exposed to erlotinib, an inhibitor of EGFR, and dasatinib, a SRC inhibitor that has broad effects on multiple tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases [Karaman MW, et al. Nature biotechnology (2008) 26: 127-32; Hantschel O, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2007) 104: 13283-8; Rix U, et al. Blood (2007) 1 10: 4055-63]. In HCC827 cells with activating EGFR mutation, both inhibitors induce apoptosis; in H358 and H292 cells with wild- type EGFR, both agents induce cell cycle arrest; H441 cells are resistant to both agents with neither apoptosis nor growth arrest observed [Song L, et al., Cancer Res (2006) 66: 5542-8; and data not shown]. SH2 domain binding was again examined using the rosette assay and far-western blotting for select probes. Using rosette assays, changes of all domains were quantified and the data plotted as waterfall plots ranking changes in SH2 binding compared to control. In the HCC827 cells, erlotinib results in complete collapse of phosphotyrosine signaling as large decreases in SH2 binding amongst almost all probes is observed. The most significant reductions in binding occurred with Grb2, Grap2, Vav2, and Vav1 SH2 domains consistent with strong loss of binding to activated EGFR with erlotinib therapy. Similar changes were observed with dasatinib (R=0.70) suggesting a generalized overlap of mechanism, yet fold changes were less in Grb2, Grap2, and Vav probes consistent with less potent effects on EGFR phosphorylation [Song L, et al., Cancer Res (2006) 66: 5542-8]. H358 cells demonstrated a marked reduction in almost all SH2 domain binding probes, similar to that observed with HCC827 cells, and more significant overlap existed between erlotinib and dasatinib (R=0.94). These results indicate that phenotypic effects of both agents occur through near identical signaling networks. In H441 cells reductions in SH2 binding intensity were similar between erlotinib and dasatinib (R=0.86), however a group of SH2 domains that demonstrate increased binding in the presence of both inhibitors compared to control cells was also identified. This could suggest activation of a tyrosine kinase or shift of SH2 domain containing proteins to other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that could account for resistance to these inhibitors. Finally, the H292 cell had the least dramatic fold changes in SH2 domain binding intensity and greater differences between erlotinib and dasatinib profiles were observed compared to the other cell lines tested (R=0.55). This could suggest that the targets of the drugs are less overlapping in H292 cells, and despite similar phenotypic effects on cell proliferation, the mechanism of action of the inhibitors is different. Thus, SH2 domains can detect a core phosphoproteome changing in response to both tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as distinct changes unique to each individual inhibitor. \n\n In addition to examining cells in response to EGFR TKI, studies were performed stimulating the EGFR with exogenous ligand (EGF). The data suggest differential binding patterns (data not shown). The experiments can be improved through an examination of kinetics would be instructive since EGFR activation and deactivation can occur rapidly and are dependent on cell context such as EGFR mutation status. \n\n\nExample 5 - SH2 profiles can identify lung cancer cells dependent on both EGFR and MET for downstream signaling and growth \n\n\n One particular strength of SH2 profiling is the identification of cells with hyperactivated tyrosine kinases that act in concert to drive downstream signaling. We noted that the H1648 cell line clustered tightly with the H820 cell line that has been previously characterized and found to have an activating EGFR mutation along with MET amplification [Bean J, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2007) 104: 20932-7.] A closer examination of the far-western results of both H820 and H1648 cells probed with p85 SH2 domains demonstrates strong binding near ~190 kDa corresponding to HER family members and ~150 corresponding to activated MET (FIG 5A). These results suggest that H 1648 cells may be similar to H820 cells in having downstream signaling driven by dual EGFR and MET signaling. To test this, we exposed H1648 cells to inhibitors of EGFR (erlotinib), MET (PHA665752) or the combination and examined downstream Akt and ERK phosphorylation (FIG 5B). We observed modest reductions in phosphorylated Akt in response to either inhibitor alone but marked inhibition of phosphorylated Akt with dual EGFR and MET inhibition. The effects on cell growth mirrored the signaling responses as combination of both agents resulted in enhanced inhibition of cell growth (FIG 5C). Further examination of the p85 far-western blots identified a number of other cell lines with a strong band at -150 kDa corresponding to activated MET. These are HCC827, H4006, H358, and H441. Remarkably, in both rosette and far-western SH2 profiling, all these cell lines with presumptive MET activation cluster in a distinct, tight group (the lone exception is H358, which is an outlier in the rosette assay clustering). Thus global pTyr patterns, assayed by SH2 profiling, predict MET activation in these cell lines. \n\n\n In addition, we examined p85A SH2 domain binding in H1703 lung cancer cells that were previously reported to be dependent on PDGFR for growth and survival [Rikova K, et al., Cell (2007) 131 : 1 190-203]. Imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor, inhibited cell growth in concert with a reduction in phosphorylated Akt. This indicates that PDGFR is driving the Akt pathway, likely by regulating PI3K activity. H 1703 cells were exposed to imatinib for 1 hr and lysates used to perform far-western blotting with purified p85A SH2 domains. Blots were also probed with PDGFR antibody to align the bands. As shown in FIG. 5D, untreated H1703 cells have a single p85A SH2 binding band at the exact mobility of PDGFR and this binding is abolished by treatment with imatinib. These results highlight the ability of SH2 domain profiling to \n\n identify cooperation of receptor tyrosine kinases in control of distal signaling and cellular growth. \n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n\nCell lines and Reagents \n\n\n Human lung cancer cell lines H292, H358, H441 , A549, H460, H1703 and H1299 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HCC827 cells were provided by Dr. Jon Kurie (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), H 1648, H2122, H226 and H157 cells were provided by Dr. John Minna (UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), H322 were provided by Dr. Paul Bunn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO), H23 cells were provided by Dr. Gerald Bepler (Moffitt Cancer Center. Tampa, FL), and UKY cells were provided by Dr. Penni Black (University of Kentucky). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) except H292 and H441 cells, which were grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 1 .5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 .0 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% NCS. Erlotinib was provided by OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, NY), dasatinib by Bristol Myers Oncology (Princeton, NJ), imatinib was provided by Novartis (Cambridge, MA), and PHA665752 by Pfizer (San Diego, CA) [Christensen JG, et al., Cancer research (2003) 63: 7345-55]. Stock solutions in 100% DMSO were diluted directly in the media to indicated concentrations. \n\n\n SH2 Domain Profiling \n\n\n The high throughput SH2/PTB domain binding assay was performed as described [Machida K, et al, Mol Cell (2007) 26: 899-915; Dierck K, et al. In: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, NJ 2009) 527: 131 -55, ix]. Briefly, lung cancer cell lysates were spotted in duplicate on a nitrocellulose membrane in register with the wells of a 96-well chamber plate. The membrane was dried, blocked, and incubated with purified GST-SH2 or PTB domains at concentrations of -100 nM for 2 hours. Probe binding was detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer) and digitally captured with Kodak Image Station (Kodak). The binding assay was performed four times, including at least two separate experiments, and the average signal intensity for each spot was manually quantified using densitometry (ImageJ v1.40). Far-Western analysis for lung cancer cell lysates was performed as described [Machida K, and Mayer BJ. In: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, NJ 2009; 536: 313-29; Nollau P, and Mayer BJ. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2001 ) 98: 13531 -6]. Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane replicas were incubated with various labeled GST-SH2 domains for 2 hours, and bands were detected by chemiluminescence and captured with Kodak Image Station. Blots were stripped and reprobed several times with additional SH2 domains and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY100, Cell Signaling). To quantify bands on multiple blots derived from different gels, SH2 \n\n blot images were aligned in reference to corresponding anti-phosphotyrosine blots with Adobe Photoshop CS3 software (Adobe). The aligned blot images from two independent experiments were quantified using a custom-made plug-in written for ImageJ densitometry (H. Zhang, J. Maddox, and D.G. Shin, University of Connecticut). \n\n\n Protein Expression Analysis \n\n\nCells were washed with ice-cold PBS and extracted with chilled lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 60 mM KCI, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% N P-40, 10 mM Na\n3\nV0\n4\n, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, ^g/ml aprotinin, 1 μg /ml leupeptin, ^g /ml pepstatin). Total cellular proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies used in these studies consisted of rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for pTyr 1344/45 MET, pThr202/Tyr204-p44/42 ERK , pSer473- AKT, and PDGFR from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) and β-actin antibody from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Standard detection of proteins was accomplished using horseradish-peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) purchased through Amersham (Piscataway, NJ). \n\n\nCell Viability, Proliferation, and Apoptosis Assays \n\n\n Cell viability assays (MTT) were performed according to the manufacturers recommendations of Cell Proliferation Kit from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). Cells were plated at 2-5 x10\n3\n cells per well in 96-well plates, incubated overnight, exposed to a serial dilution of dasatinb or erlotinib) in 5% NCS complete media, and viability assessed following 5 days of incubation. The IC\n50\n was calculated by non-linear regression analyses using MATLAB scripts that pair data points with sigmoidal curves that predict a signal response based on a four-parameter fit. Data presented represents three separate experiments with 8 data points separating each dose per condition. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. \n\n\n EGFR and K-Ras Genotyping \n\n\nGenomic DNA extraction from each NSCLC cultured cell lines was performed using DNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Sequencing of exon 19, 20, and 21 of EGFR was performed as previously described. For K-RAS, the primers were K-Ras exon 1 (forward), 5' TTAACCTTATGTGTGACATGTTCTAA-3' and (reverse) 5'-AGAATGGTCCTGCACCAGTAA- 3', which generates a fragment of 225 bp, and K-Ras exon 2 (forward), 5'- TCAAGTCCTTTGCCCATTTT-3' and (reverse) 5'-TGCATGGCATTAGCAAAGAC-3', which generates a fragment of 374 bp. PCR amplification for K-Ras exon 1 consisted of 40 cycles (95°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s and 72°C for 45 s) and for K-Ras exon 2 consisted of 40 cycles (95°C for 45 s, 52°C for 45 s and 72°C for 45 s), and then followed by incubation at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were separated on a 1 % agarose gel and purified by DNA Gel Extraction \n\n Kit (Millipore). DNA sequence was analyzed using the Applied Biosystems 3130X1 Genetic analyzer (HITACHI) and data analysis was done using Lasergene software V7.2. \n\n\n Network Analysis \n\n\n To examine the biological significance and provide improved visualization of these results, we input SH2 domains into PPI Spider, a tool for interpreting proteomics data in the context of protein-protein interaction networks (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppispider/). Analysis were run with 100 random networks and only proteins that directly connect to each other through no more than one edge were allowed for visualization. Networks were subsequently input into Cytoscape for visualization. \n\n\n Statistical Analysis \n\n\nRosette Assay: The quantified intensity for each assay was assessed by examining for batch effects using ANOVA and calculating coefficient of variation (CV) for each probe across replicates. Individual probes were characterized using a positive and negative control and probes with low signal and small differences between controls were excluded from clustering analysis. \n\n\nTwo-group Comparisons Domains were identified as statistically significant with respect to dichotomous characteristics (EGFR Mutation, RAS Mutation or Met Activation) using a Mann- Whitney test applied to each domain. The false discovery rates (q values) were calculated using the Q Value package in Bioconductor (Storey et al) and a 10% FDR was considered significant. \n\n\nCorrelation to Erlotinib sensitivity: Erlotinib IC50 values for the 22 cell lines were log transformed and the Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed for each domain. Domains were considered correlated with | R|≥0.5 (R\n2\n≥ 0.25). \n\n\n Far Western Clustering. Data from individual grids was combined across the two replicates using the mean. Domain-specific bands were filtered with a standard deviation > 5, and at least 1 1 of 22 cell lines having intensity above 10.0 for a specific domain-specific band. There were 188 domain-specific bands remaining after the filtering step. The data was clustered using Cluster 3.0 and visualized using Java Treeview. For visualization purposes, the intensities were scaled so that light shaded represents below 10.0 (approximately the mean intensity of the data) and dark shaded above 10.0. \n\n\nFar Western differences with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Data from individual grids was quantified and domain-specific bands were filtered with a standard deviation > 5, and at least 3 of 8 cell lines/conditions having intensity above 10.0 for a specific domain-specific band. There were 197 domain-specific bands remaining after the filtering step. \n\n All references cited in the present application are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference to the extent not inconsistent herewith. \n\n\n It will be seen that the advantages set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained and since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. \n\n\n It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.

Description\n\n\n\n\n GPR1 19 MODULATORS \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The invention relates to a new class of ring fused pyrrolidines, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their use to modulate the activity of the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR1 19. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n Diabetes mellitus are disorders in which high levels of blood glucose occur as a consequence of abnormal glucose homeostasis. The most common forms of diabetes mellitus are Type I (also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and Type II diabetes (also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). Type II diabetes, accounting for roughly 90% of all diabetic cases, is a serious progressive disease that results in microvascular complications (including for example retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy) as well as macrovascular complications (including for example accelerated atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke). \n\n\n Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. Standard treatments for the disease are limited, and focus on controlling blood glucose levels to minimize or delay complications. Current treatments target either insulin resistance (metformin or thiazolidinediones) or insulin release from beta cells (sulphonylureas, exanatide). Sulphonylureas and other compounds that act via depolarization of the beta cell promote hypoglycemia as they stimulate insulin secretion independent of circulating glucose concentrations. One approved drug, exanatide, stimulates insulin secretion in the presence of high glucose, but must be injected due to a lack of oral bioavailablity. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, is a drug that increases blood levels of incretin hormones, which can increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion and have other less well characterized effects. However, sitagliptin and other dipeptidyl peptidases IV inhibitors may also influence the tissue levels of other hormones and peptides, and the long-term consequences of this broader effect have not been fully investigated. \n\n\n In Type II diabetes, muscle, fat and liver cells fail to respond normally to insulin. This condition (insulin resistance) may be due to reduced numbers of cellular insulin receptors, disruption of cellular signaling pathways, or both. At first, the beta cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Eventually, however, the beta cells become unable to produce sufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels (euglycemia), indicating progression to Type II diabetes. \n\n In Type II diabetes, fasting hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance combined with beta cell dysfunction. There are two aspects of beta cell defect dysfunction: 1 ) increased basal insulin release (occurring at low, non-stimulatory glucose concentrations). This is observed in obese, insulin-resistant pre-diabetic stages as well as in Type II diabetes, and 2) in response to a hyperglycemic challenge, a failure to increase insulin release above the already elevated basal level. This does not occur in pre-diabetic stages and may signal the transition from normo-glycemic insulin- resistant states to Type II diabetes. Current therapies to treat the latter aspect include inhibitors of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel to trigger the release of endogenous insulin stores, and administration of exogenous insulin. Neither achieves accurate normalization of blood glucose levels, and both carry the risk of eliciting hypoglycemia. \n\n\n Thus, there has been great interest in the discovery of agents that function in a glucose-dependent manner. Physiological signaling pathways which function in this way are well known, including gut peptides GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones signal via cognate G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate production of cAMP in pancreatic beta-cells. Increased cAMP, apparently, does not result in stimulation of insulin release during the fasting or pre-prandial state. However, a number of biochemical targets of cAMP, including the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, voltage-sensitive potassium channels and the exocytotic machinery, are modulated such that insulin secretion due to postprandial glucose stimulation is significantly enhanced. Therefore, agonist modulators of novel, similarly functioning, beta-cell GPCRs, including GPR1 19, would also stimulate the release of endogenous insulin and promote normalization of glucose levels in Type II diabetes patients. It has also been shown that increased cAMP, for example as a result of GLP- 1 stimulation, promotes beta-cell proliferation, inhibits beta- cell death and, thus, improves islet mass. This positive effect on beta-cell mass should be beneficial in Type II diabetes where insufficient insulin is produced. \n\n\n It is well known that metabolic diseases have negative effects on other physiological systems and there is often co-occurrence of multiple disease states (e.g. Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, inadequate glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, \n\n\ndyslipidemia, obesity or cardiovascular disease in \"Syndrome X\") or secondary diseases which occur secondary to diabetes such as kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, there exists a need for new treatments of the diabetic condition. \n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n In accordance with the invention, a new class of GPR1 19 modulators has been discovered. These compounds may be represented by formula I, as shown below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I wherein: \n\n\n X is A \n\n\n\n\n\n A B \n\n\n Y is O or a bond; \n\n\nR\n1\n is -C(0)-0-R\n3\n or - N= V/ \nR4\n \n;\n \n\n\n R\n2\n is hydrogen, cyano, C1-C6 alkyl, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n3\n is C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl substituted with C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, CrCefluoroalkyl, halo, or hydroxy, with the proviso that the halo, C1-C6 alkoxy, or hydroxy groups are not attached at the carbon atom connected to O in R\n1\n; \n\n\n R\n4\n is C1-C6 haloalkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, halo, cyano, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n5\n is hydrogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6 fluoroalkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 fluoroalkoxy, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n6\n is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 fluoroalkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, or C1-C6 alkyl substituted with C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, or hydroxyl with the proviso that the Cr C6 alkoxy or hydroxyl groups is not attached to the carbon connected to the pyrazole nitrogen; \n\n\n R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are each independently hydrogen, fluoro, or C1-C6 alkyl; and \n\n R , R , R , and R\nBa\n are each independently hydrogen, C C\n6\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, or d-Ce alkyl substituted with hydroxy or C.,- C\n6\n alkoxy; \n\n\n or R\n8a\n and R\n8b\n may be taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to form a C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n or R\n8c\n and R\n8d\n may be taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to form a C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n or R\n8a\n and R\n8c\n may be taken together to form a fully saturated two carbon bridge with the proviso that R\n8a\n and R\n8c\n are on the same plane of the ring system to which they are attached; \n\n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I modulate the activity of the G-protein-coupled receptor.

Unless specified otherwise, it is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the invention. In addition, the invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and transforms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. \n\n\n Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization, distillation, sublimation. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into \n\n a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) column. \n\n\n It is also possible that the intermediates and compounds of the invention may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term \"tautomer\" or \"tautomeric form\" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. A specific example of a proton tautomer is the imidazole moiety where the proton may migrate between the two ring nitrogens. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. The equilibrium between closed and opened form of some intermediates (and/or mixtures of intermediates) is reminiscent of the process of mutarotation involving aldoses, known by those skilled in the art. \n\n\n In addition, the compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention. The compounds may also exist in one or more crystalline states, i.e. polymorphs, or they may exist as amorphous solids. All such forms are encompassed by the claims. \n\n\n The invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\n0, \n17\n0, \n18\n0, \n31\n P, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n123\nl, \n125\nl and \n36\nCI, respectively. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. \n\n\nTritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such \n\n as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as \n15\n0, \n13\nN, \n11\nC, and \n18\nF are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non- isotopically-labeled reagent. \n\n\n Some of the compounds of formula I contain an 3-oxa-7-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring bonded to a pyrimidine ring via an ether linkage as depicted below. This \n\n\nazabicyclo-nonane will exist as a geometric isomer and may be present as either the syn or nti isomer as depicted below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment of a compound having formula I, X is A and R\n1\n is -C(0)-0-R\n3\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n8a\n, R\n8b\n, R\n8c\n, and R\n8d\n are each hydrogen and R\n3\n is C3-C6 cycloalkyl substituted with C1-C3 alkyl. \n\n\n In another embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are each independently hydrogen, fluoro, or C1-C3 alkyl. \n\n\n In a further embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n2\n is hydrogen and R\n5\n is C1-C6 alkyl. \n\n\nSynthesis \n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well-known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wl) or are readily prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, New York (1967-1999 ed.), or Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, \n\n Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database). \n\n\n For illustrative purposes, the reaction schemes depicted below provide potential routes for synthesizing the compounds of the invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I can be prepared using methods analogously known in the art for the production of ethers. The reader's attention is directed to texts such as: 1 ) Hughes, D. L; Organic Reactions 1992, 42 335-656 Hoboken, NJ, United States; 2) Tikad, A.; Routier, S.; Akssira, M.; Leger, J.-M.l; Jarry, C; Guillaumet, G. Synlett 2006, 12, 1938-42; and 3) Loksha, Y. M.; Globisch, D.; Pedersen, E. B.; La Colla, P.; Collu, G.; Loddo, R.J. Het. Chem. 2008, 45, 1 161-6 which describe such reactions in greater detail. \n\n\n Scheme I, immediately below, illustrates alternative methodologies for assembling the compounds of formula I. The central portion of the molecule is an optionally substituted pyrimidine ring. The compounds of formula I are produced by forming both an ether linkage and an amino linkage with the pyrimidine as depicted below. It is not critical in what order this reaction sequence is carried out except in cases where R\n5\n is cyano or nitro. In such cases, Steps l-B and l-C are used to assemble compounds of formula I. \n\n\nSCHEME I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting material in reaction Scheme I, is the dihydroxy-pyrimidine of structure compound 1-1 in which R\n2\n and R\n5\n, are typically represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product, as described herein. Methods for producing such pyrimidines are known in the art. \n\n\n The chlorination reaction of step l-A is carried out as is known in the art. A compound of structure 1-1 is allowed to react with a chlorinating reagent such as POCU (phosphorous oxychloride) (Matulenko, M. A. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2007, 15, 1586-1605) used in excess or in solvents such as toluene, benzene or xylene with or without additives such as triethylamine, A/JV-dimethylaniline, or N,N- diisopropylethylamine . This reaction may be run at temperatures ranging from room temperature (about 23 degrees Celsius) to about 140 degrees Celsius, depending on the choice of conditions. Alternative chlorinating reagents may consist of PCI3, \n\n\n(phosphorous trichloride), POCI3/PCI5 (phosphorous pentachloride), thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride or phosgene to give a dichloropyrimidine of structure I-2. In some cases the dichloropyrimidine of structure I-2 may be obtained from commercial sources. \n\n Optionally, the dichloropyrimidine of structure 1-2 may be isolated and recovered from the reaction and further purified as is known in the art. Alternatively the crude material may be used in Step l-B described below. \n\n\n In Step l-B of Scheme I, an amino linkage is formed between the \n\n\ntetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole of structure 1-3 and the dichloropyrimidine of structure I- 2. In the fused pyrrolidine of structure 1-3, R\n6\n ,R\n8a\n, R\n8b\n, R\n8c\n, and R\n8d\n will typically be represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product, as described herein. Such tetrahydropyrrole^, 4-c]pyrazole derivatives are known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art (Heterocycles, 2002, 56, 257-264). The amino linkage is formed by reacting equivalent amounts of the compounds of structure 1-2 and 1-3 in a polar protic solvent such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol at temperatures ranging from about 0 to 120 degrees Celsius, depending on which solvent is used, for 0.5 to 24 hours. Typical conditions utilized for this reaction are the use of isopropanol as the solvent heated at 108 degrees Celsius for one hour. Alternatively, an amine base such as triethylamine or diethylisopropylamine or inorganic bases such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate may be added to this reaction. In the case of the use of one of the above amine or inorganic bases, the solvent may be changed to a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, A/JV-dimethyl formamide (\"DMF\"), tetrahydrofuran (\"THF\") or 1 ,4-dioxane at about 0 to 100 degrees Celsius for 0.5 to 24 hours. Typical conditions utilized for this reaction include the use of diethylisopropylamine in acetonitrile at room temperature for three hours. Also, the use of hydrochloric acid in polar protic solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol or propanol alone or in combination may be used for this transformation at temperatures of about 0 to 1 10 degrees Celsius. Typical conditions are the use of water in ethanol at 78 degrees Celsius. The intermediate of structure I-5 may be isolated and recovered from the reaction and further purified as is known in the art. Alternatively the crude material may be used in Step l-C described below. \n\n\n In Step l-C of Scheme I, an ether linkage is formed between the intermediate of structure I-5 and the alcohol of structure I-4 to form the compound of formula I. In the alcohol of structure I-4, X will be A, B, or C and R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n will be represented by the same substituent as found in the desired final product. The substituents represented by R\n1\n may be manipulated after the core of formula I is produced. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art and should be considered part of the invention. In Step l-C, equivalent amounts of the reactants are reacted in the presence of a base such as \n\n sodium hydride; sodium and potassium tert-butoxide; sodium, potassium, and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and sodium, potassium and lithium tert-amyloxide in solvents such as DMF, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, 1 ,4-dioxane, A/,/V-dimethylacetamide, or dimethylsulfoxide (\"DMSO\"). Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in 1 ,4-dioxane at about 105 degrees Celsius for one hour. \n\n\n After the reaction is completed the desired compound of formula I may be recovered and isolated as known in the art. It may be recovered by evaporation, extraction, etc. as is known in the art. It may optionally be purified by chromatography, recrystallization, distillation, or other techniques known in the art. \n\n\n In the alternative synthesis depicted above in Reaction Scheme I, the dichloro- pyrimidine of structure I-2 is initially reacted with the alcohol of structure I-4 to form the intermediate depicted by structure I-6. As with Step l-C, structure I-4 will be an alcohol where X is A, B, or C dependent upon the desired final product. In these heterocyclic rings, R\n1\n and R\n4\n will typically be represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product or R\n1\n may manipulated after the core of formula I is produced. \n\n\n Equivalent amounts of the compounds of structure I-2 and structure I-4 are allowed to react in the presences of a polar aprotic solvent and a base to form intermediates of structure I-6 as depicted in step l-D. Suitable systems include bases such as sodium hydride, sodium and potassium tert-butoxide, sodium, potassium, and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and sodium, potassium and lithium tert-amyloxide in solvents such as DMF, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, 1 ,4-dioxane, N,N- dimethylacetamide, or DMSO at temperatures of 0 to 140 degrees Celsius. Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of potassium tert-butoxide in THF at about 0 degrees Celsius to room temperature for 14 hours. The intermediate of structure I-6 may be isolated and recovered from the reaction and further purified as is known in the art. Alternatively the crude material may be used in Step l-E, described below. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I may then be formed by reacting the intermediate of structure I-6 with the fused tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole derivatives I-3, described above. Typically, equivalent amounts of the fused pyrrolidine of structure I-3 are allowed to react with the chloro intermediate of formula I-6 in the presence of a base. Suitable bases can be sodium hydride, sodium or potassium te/t-butoxide, sodium or potassium or lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and sodium or potassium or lithium tert-amyloxide in solvents such as DMF, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, 1 ,4-dioxane, N,N- \n\n dimethylacetamide, or DMSO or mixtures thereof. These reactions may be carried out in temperature ranges of about -10 to 150 degrees Celsius depending on the solvent of use. Typically, the reaction will be allowed to proceed for a period of time ranging from about 15 minutes to 24 hours under an inert atmosphere. Suitable conditions include sodium bis(dimethylsilyl)amide in 1 ,4-dioxane at 105 degrees Celsius for one hour. \n\n\n Alternatively, this reaction may be carried out by heating the intermediate of structure I-6 and tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole derivatives of structure I-3 in a polar protic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol for 0.5 to 24 hours. Typical conditions for this transformation are heating in isopropanol at 108 degrees Celsius for two hours. \n\n\n This reaction may also by carried out using transition metal catalysts to form the key substituted amine linkage found in the compounds of formula I. Transition metal catalysts may consist of but are not limited to triphenylphosphine) Palladium \n\n\n(Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n), Palladium(ll) chloride (PdCI\n2\n), Palladium(ll) acetate (Pd(OAc)\n2\n), \n\n\n(tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(O) (Pd\n2\n(dba)3), Copper(l) iodide (Cul), Copper(ll) acetate (Cu(OAc)\n2\n) and Copper(ll) trifluoromethane (Cu(OTf)\n2\n). A base is typically utilized in these reactions. A suitable base for use with palladium catalysts may be sodium tert-butoxide, potassium terf-butoxide, potassium tert-amyloxide or K\n3\nP0\n4\n in an appropriate solvents such as 1 ,4-dioxane, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane or toluene. For the use of copper catalysts, a suitable base may consist of alkali bases such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate in an appropriate solvents such as DMF, DMSO or dimethylacetamide. \n\n\n Typically ligands can be added to facilitate the amine formation reaction. Ligands for palladium catalyzed reactions may include but are not limited to 9,9-dimethyl-4,5- bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (Xantphos), 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1 ,1 '- binaphthyl (BINAP), 1 , 1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF), 2,8,9-triisobutyl- 2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1 -phosphabicyclo[3.3.3]undecane (P[N(/-Bu)CH\n2\nCH\n3\n]\n3\nN), tri-te/t- butylphosphine (te/?-Bu3P), (biphenyl-2-yl)bis(te/?-butyl)phosphine (JohnPhos), Pd- PEPPSI™-SIPr: (1 ,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene) (3- chloropyridyl) palladium(ll) dichloride. Suitable ligands for copper catalyzed reactions may include but are not limited to /.-proline, N-methylglycine, diethylsalicyclamide. Suitable conditions for formation of compounds of formula I are the use of Pd\n2\n(dba)3 with sodium tert-butoxide in toluene at 120 degrees Celsius for 12 hours. \n\n\n After the reaction is completed the desired compound of formula I may be recovered and isolated as known in the art. It may be recovered by evaporation, \n\n extraction, etc. as is known in the art. It may optionally be purified by chromatography, recrystallization, distillation, or other techniques known in the art prior. \n\n\n As is also readily apparent to one skilled in the art, many of the substituents represented by R\n1\n may be manipulated after the core of formula I is produced. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art and should be considered part of the invention. \n\n\n Scheme II \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scheme II describes a method for the production of alcohols of structure 11-14 and 11-15 which corresponds to X is B in formula I of the invention. R\n3\n, R\n6\n, R\n7a\n, and R\n7b\n are typically represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product, as described herein. Syntheses of compounds of structure II-8 from compounds of structure II-7 are known in the art. These transformations (Step ll-A) are taught in the literature and are exemplified in: J. Org. Chem., 1981 , 46, 3196-3204, JP2009096744, WC035303, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 5654-5655, and Org. Lett., 2006, 3, 430-436. In Step ll-B of Scheme II, the carbonyl group of the ketone is reduced using standards protocols known in the art such as the use of sodium borohydride in an alcoholic solvent like methanol at a temperature ranging from about 0 degrees Celsius to room \n\n\ntemperature. Step ll-D, the removal of the benzyl protecting group from structure 11-10 to provide 11-1 1 , can be accomplished via hydrogenolysis. Typical conditions for this reaction include utilizing hydrogen and a palladium catalyst including 5 to 20% \n\n palladium on carbon or 10 to 20% palladium hydroxide. A typical solvent for this reaction is ethanol, methanol, tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate. \n\n\n If a pyrimidine substituent is desired in the final product, then structure 11-14 may be formed via the addition of compound 11-1 1 to an appropriately substituted 2- chloropyrimidine as depicted by structure 11-12 in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate or Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine in a protic solvent such as ethanol or methanol, or a polar aprotic solvent such as 1 ,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N,N- dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide. These reactions can be conducted at temperatures ranging from about room temperature to about 1 10 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, compounds of structure 11-1 1 and structure 11-12 can be heated together in the presence of base such as Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine without solvent, or where compound 11-1 1 is used in excess without base or solvent. \n\n\n If a carbamate substituent is desired in the final product then equivalent amounts of the alkyl haloformate of structure 11-13 is reacted with the compound of structure 11-1 1 in the presence of a base such as Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine , triethylamine or pyridine in dichloromethane or chloroform. Alternatively, compounds of structure 11-15 can formed from compounds of structure 11-1 1 via the use of dialkyldicarbonates such as di- tert-butyl dicarbonate (BOC anhydride) or di-isopropyl dicarbonate in the presence of amine bases such as Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine , pyridine, 2,6-lutidine or triethylamine in solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or tetrahydrofuran. In addition, when R\n3\n = 1-methyl-cyclopropyl or 1 -difluoromethyl-cyclopropyl, the carbamate functionality can be introduced using carbonate 11-13' (see WO09105717 and WO09005677) in a solvent like dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran in presence of a base like triethylamine, Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine and the like at temperature ranging from about zero degrees Celsius to about ambient temperature. \n\n\n Final structure 11-14 or 11-15 may be isolated and purified as is known in the art. If desired, it may be subjected to a separation step to yield the desired syn- or anti- isomer. \n\n\n Alternatively, unsymmetrical structures of formula 11-10 where at least one of R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n is hydrogen, may be accessed via a double Mannich reaction between bis- aminol ether derivatives II-9 and ketone II-7, followed by reduction of the ketone carbonyl and functional group manipulation to provide structures of type 11-10. It is recognized that in certain instances R\n9a\n will preferably be an alpha-methyl-benzyl group rather than the benzyl group shown in structure 11-10. Suitable R\n9b\n groups include methyl or ethyl. The use of the double Mannich reaction to yield structures of formula II- \n\n 8 has been published in the chemistry literature (Tetrahedron 2005 61, 5876-5888; Org. Lett. 2006 8, 3399-3401 ) and can be attained by those skilled in the art. Similarly, structures of formula 11-10 where both R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are fluoro, can be accessed starting from readily available starting material using protocols known in chemical literature for the formation of cis- or trans- difluoro-2,6 cyclohexanone {Tetrahedron 1970 26, 2447). \n\n\n Scheme III describes the preparation of compounds of formula 111-19 which correspond to X is A in formula I. \n\n\n Scheme III \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As shown in Scheme III compounds of formula 111-19 where R\n3\n is as described herein and at least one R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are hydrogen, can be prepared starting with commercially available A/-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone (Aldrich) or from 4- piperidone followed by carbamate formation. Compounds for the formula 111-19 are prepared by reduction of compounds of the formula 111-16 or 111-18 by reduction of the ketone carbonyl as indicated by Step lll-A. Suitable conditions for this include the use of sodium borohydride in a mixture of an alcoholic solvent, such as ethanol, and THF. Compounds of the formula 111-19 where at least one of R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n is fluoro can be prepared by enolization of the ketone, trapping as the silyl enol ether and reaction with the appropriate electrophilic fluoro source as described in J. Org. Chem. 2003 68, 3232 and J. Org. Chem. 2002 67, 8610. Compounds of formula 111-18 where at least one of R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n is an alkyl group can be similarly prepared using the appropriate \n\n\nelectrophilic alkyl group such as alkyl halides or sulfonates. In addition, structures of formula 111-19 where both R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are halo, such as fluoro, can be accessed from readily available A/-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone using similar protocols known in the chemical literature {Tetrahedron, 1970, 26, 2447). It is also recognized that when X is A in formula I of the invention that such piperidine compounds are commercially available, \n\n are known in the literature or can be prepared from commercial (Aldrich) N-tert- butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone or other suitably N-protected piperidones. \n\n\n It is recognized that the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (R\n3\n is tert-butyl) can be removed at many stages in the synthesis using acid such as hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and the resulting free amine can be converted to an alternative carbamate or pyrimidine using general conditions described in respectively step ll-E' and ll-E in scheme II. The preparation of compounds of formula 111-19 are also described in WO2009014910. \n\n\n Scheme IV describes the synthesis of compounds of formula IV-23. \n\n\nScheme IV \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IV-20 IV-21 IV-23\n\n\nTetrahydropyrrolo-pyrazoles of the formula IV-23 in Scheme IV can be prepared from compounds of the formula IV-21 by addition/cyclodehydration with the appropriate hydrazine of formula IV-22 (Step IV-B), followed by deprotection of the tert- butyloxycarbonyl group (Step IV-C). Compounds of the formula IV-21 can be prepared from compounds of the formula IV-20 of Scheme IV by a formylation reaction (Step IV- A). Suitable conditions for Step IV-A in Scheme IV include heating of compound IV-20 in the presence of A/,A/-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA). Compounds of formula IV-20 in Scheme IV are commercially available (Aldrich), are known in the literature or can be readily prepared by one skilled in the art. \n\n\n Examples where R\n8a\n and R\n8b\n or R\n8c\n and R\n8d\n may be taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to form a C3-C6 cycloalkyl are found in Journal of Organic Chemistry 2004 69, 2755-2759 and Journal of Organic Chemistry 1962 27, 2901 -5. An example where R\n8a\n and R\n8c\n may be taken together to form a fully saturated two carbon bridge where R\n8a\n and R\n8c\n are on the same plane of the ring system to which they are attached include (1 R,4S)-tert-butyl 2-oxo-7-azabicylclo [2.2.1 ]heptane-7- carboxylate (commercially available from Brother Chemistry Co. CAS number 16513- 98-2). Racemic forms of this compound are also known in the literature (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2003 46, 921-924; Journal of Organic Chemistry 1994 59, 1771-8, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2008 18, 4651-4654). \n\n As is readily apparent to one skilled in the art, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, /-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) and 9- fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a \"hydroxy-protecting group\" refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. \n\n\nSuitable hydroxyl-protecting groups (O-Pg) include for example, allyl, acetyl, silyl, benzyl, para-methoxybenzyl, trityl, and the like. The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991 . \n\n\n As noted above, some of the compounds of this invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable cations. Some of the compounds of this invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable anions. All such salts are within the scope of this invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, nonaqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds are obtained in crystalline form according to procedures known in the art, such as by dissolution in an appropriate solvent(s) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures. \n\n\n The invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\n0, \n17\n0, \n18\n0, \n31\n P, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n123\nl, \n125\nl and \n36\nCI, respectively. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Certain isotopically-labeled ligands including tritium, \n14\nC, \n35\nS and \n125\nl could be useful in radioligand binding assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution \n\n with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as \n15\n0, \n13\nN, \n11\nC, and \n18\nF are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine receptor occupancy. Isotopically- labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non-isotopically-labeled reagent. \n\n\n Certain compounds of the invention may exist in more than one crystal form (generally referred to as \"polymorphs\"). Polymorphs may be prepared by crystallization under various conditions, for example, using different solvents or different solvent mixtures for recrystallization; crystallization at different temperatures; and/or various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallization. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound of the invention followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques. \n\n\nMedical Uses \n\n\n Compounds of the invention modulate the activity of G-protein-coupled receptor GPR1 19.

(Milwaukee, Wl), Lancaster Synthesis, Inc. (Windham, NH), Acros Organics (Fairlawn, NJ), Maybridge Chemical Company, Ltd. (Cornwall, England), Tyger Scientific (Princeton, NJ), and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (London, England), Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg NJ); EMD \n\n\n(Gibbstown, NJ). \n\n\nGeneral Experimental Procedures- NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity™ 400 (DG400-5 probe) or 500 (DG500-5 probe - both available from Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at room temperature at 400 MHz or 500 MHz respectively for proton analysis.

The source of supply is provided in parenthesis. \n\n\nIn -Vitro Functional Assays \n\n\nβ-lactamase: \n\n\n The assay for GPR1 19 agonists utilizes a cell-based (hGPR1 19 HEK293-CRE beta-lactamase) reporter construct where agonist activation of human GPR1 19 is coupled to beta-lactamase production via a cyclic AMP response element \n\n\n(CRE). GPR1 19 activity is then measured utilizing a FRET-enabled beta-lactamase \n\n substrate, CCF4-AM (Live Blazer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen cat # \n\n\nK1027). Specifically, hGPR1 19-HEK-CRE- beta-lactamase cells (Invitrogen 2.5 x 10\n7\n/mL) were removed from liquid nitrogen storage, and diluted in plating medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM; Gibco Cat # 1 1995-065), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Sigma Cat # F4135), 1 X MEM \n\n\nNonessential amino acids (Gibco Cat # 15630-080), 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630-080), 200 nM potassium clavulanate (Sigma Cat # P3494). The cell concentration was adjusted using cell plating medium and 50 microL of this cell suspension (12.5 x 10\n4\n viable cells) was added into each well of a black, clear bottom, poly-d-lysine coated 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One cat# 781946) and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. After 4 hours the plating medium was removed and replaced with 40 microL of assay medium (Assay medium is plating medium without potassium clavulanate and HIFBS). Varying concentrations of each compound to be tested was then added in a volume of 10 microL (final DMSO < 0.5%) and the cells were incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 15 minutes. 10 microL of 6 X CCF4/AM working dye solution (prepared according to instructions in the Live Blazer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen cat # K1027) was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark. Fluorescence was measured on an EnVision fluorimetric plate reader, excitation 405 nm, emission 460 nm/535 nm. EC\n5\no determinations were made from agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose-response equation. cAMP: \n\n\n GPR1 19 agonist activity was also determined with a cell-based assay utilizing an HTRF (Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence) cAMP detection kit (cAMP dynamic 2 Assay Kit; Cis Bio cat # 62AM4PEC) that measures cAMP levels in the cell.\n\n\nThe method is a competitive immunoassay between native cAMP produced by the ceils and the cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a Mab anti- cAMP labeled with Cryptate. The specific signal (i.e. energy transfer) is inversely proportional to the concentration of cAMP in either standard or sample. \n\n\n Specifically, hGPR1 19 HEK-CRE beta-lactamase cells (Invitrogen 2.5 x 10\n7\n/ml; the same cell line used in the beta-lactamase assay described above) are removed \n\n from cryopreservation and diluted in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM; Gibco Cat # 1 1995-065), 1 % charcoal dextran treated fetal bovine serum (CD serum; HyClone Cat # SH30068.03), 1x MEM Nonessential amino acids (Gibco Cat # 15630-080) and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630- 080)). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1 .5 x 10\n5\n cells/ml and 30 mis of this suspension was added to a T-175 flask and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 16 hours (overnight), the cells were removed from the T-175 flask (by rapping the side of the flask), centrifuged at 800 x g and then re-suspended in assay medium (1 x HBSS +CaCI\n2\n + MgCI\n2\n (Gibco Cat # 14025-092) and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630-080)). The cell \n\n\nconcentration was adjusted to 6.25 x 10\n5\n cells/ml with assay medium and 8 μΙ of this cell suspension (5000 cells) was added to each well of a white Greiner 384-well, low-volume assay plate (VWR cat # 82051 -458). \n\n\n Varying concentrations of each compound to be tested were diluted in assay buffer containing 3-isobutyl-1-methyixanthin (IBMX; Sigma cat # I5879) and added to the assay plate wells in a volume of 2 microL (final IBMX concentration was 400 microM and final DMSO concentration was 0.58%). Following 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, 5 microL of labeled d2 cAMP and 5 microL of anti-cAMP antibody (both diluted 1 :20 in cell lysis buffer; as described in the manufacturers assay protocol) were added to each well of the assay plate. The plates were then incubated at room temperature and after 60 minutes, changes in the HTRF signal were read with an Envision 2104 multilabel plate reader using excitation of 330 nm and emissions of 615 and 665 nm. Raw data were converted to nM cAMP by interpolation from a cAMP standard curve (as described in the manufacturer's assay protocol) and EC50 determinations were made from an agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-paramter logistic dose response equation. \n\n\n It is recognized that cAMP responses due to activation of GPR1 19 could be generated in cells other than the specific cell line used herein. β-Arrestin: \n\n\n GPR1 19 agonist activity was also determined with a cell-based assay utilizing DiscoverX PathHunter β-arrestin cell assay technology and their U20S hGPR1 19 β-arrestin cell line (DiscoverX Cat # 93-0356C3). In this assay, agonist activation is determined by measuring agonist-induced interaction of β-arrestin with activated GPR1 19. A small, 42 amino acid enzyme fragment, called ProLink was appended to the \n\n C-terminus of GPR1 19. Arrestin was fused to the larger enzyme fragment, termed EA (Enzyme Acceptor). Activation of GPR1 19 stimulates binding of arrestin and forces the complementation of the two enzyme fragments, resulting in formation of a functional β-galactosidase enzyme capable of hydrolyzing substrate and generating a \n\n\nchemiluminescent signal. \n\n\n Specifically, U20S hGPR1 19 β-arrestin cells (DiscoverX 1 x 10\n7\n/ml) are removed from cryopreservation and diluted in growth medium (Minimum essential medium (MEM; Gibco Cat # 1 1095-080), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Sigma Cat # F4135-100), 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma Cat # S8636), 500 microg/mL G418 (Sigma Cat # G8168) and 250 microg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen Cat # 10687-010). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1.66 x 10\n5\n cells/ml and 30 mis of this suspension was added to a T-175 flask and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 48 hours, the cells were removed from the T- 175 flask with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco cat # 13151-014), centrifuged at 800 x g and then re-suspended in plating medium (Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen/BRL Cat # 31985-070) and 2 % charcoal dextran treated fetal bovine serum (CD serum; HyClone Cat # SH30068.03). The cell concentration was adjusted to 2.5 x 10\n5\n cells/ml with plating medium and 10 microL of this cell suspension (2500 cells) was added to each well of a white Greiner 384-well low volume assay plate (VWR cat # 82051 -458) and the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. \n\n\n After 16 hours (overnight) the assay plates were removed from the incubator and varying concentrations of each compound to be tested (diluted in assay buffer (1x HBSS +CaCI\n2\n + MgCI\n2\n (Gibco Cat # 14025-092), 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630-080) and 0.1 % BSA (Sigma Cat # A9576)) were added to the assay plate wells in a volume of 2.5 microL (final DMSO concentration was 0.5 %). After a 90 minute incubation at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide, 7.5 microL of Galacton Star β-galactosidase substrate (PathHunter Detection Kit \n\n\n(DiscoveRx Cat # 93-0001 ); prepared as described in the manufacturers assay protocol) was added to each well of the assay plate. The plates were incubated at room temperature and after 60 minutes, changes in the luminescence were read with an Envision 2104 multilabel plate reader at 0.1 seconds per well. EC50 determinations were made from an agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose response equation. \n\n Expression of GPR119 Using BacMam and GPR1 19 Binding Assay \n\n\n Wild-type human GPR1 19 (Figure 1 ) was amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Pfu Turbo Mater Mix, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pIRES-puro- hGPR1 19 as a template and the following primers: \n\n\nhGPR1 19 BamH1 , Upper \n\n\n 5'-TAAATTGGATCCACCATGGAATCATCTTTCTCATTTGGAG-3' \n\n\n(inserts a BamHI site at the 5' end) hGPR1 19 EcoRI, Lower \n\n\n 5'-TAAATTGAATTCTTATCAGCCATCAAACTCTGAGC-3' \n\n\n(inserts a EcoRI site at the 3' end) \n\n\nThe amplified product was purified (Qiaquick Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with BamHI and EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The vector pFB-VSVG-CMV-poly (Figure 2) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose gel; the fragments were excised from the gel and purified (Qiaquick Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The vector and gene fragments were ligated (Rapid Ligase Kit, Roche, Pleasanton, CA) and transformed into OneShot DH5alpha T1 R cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Eight ampicillin-resistant colonies (\"clones 1 -8\") were grown for miniprep (Qiagen Miniprep Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced to confirm identity and correct insert orientation. \n\n\n The pFB-VSVG-CMV-poly-hGPR1 19 construct (clone #1 ) was transformed into OneShot DHI OBac cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturers' protocols. Eight positive (i.e. white) colonies were re-streaked to confirm as \"positives\" and subsequently grown for bacmid isolation. The recombinant hGPR1 19 bacmid was isolated via a modified Alkaline Lysis procedure using the buffers from a Qiagen Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, pelleted cells were lysed in buffer P1 , neutralized in buffer P2, and precipitated with buffer N3. Precipitate was pelleted via centrifugation (17,900xg for 10 minutes) and the supernatant was combined with isopropanol to precipitate the DNA. The DNA was pelleted via centrifugation (17,900xg for 30 minutes), washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 50 μ\\- buffer EB (Tris-HCL, pH 8.5). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with commercially available primers (M13F, M13R, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to confirm the presence of the hGPR1 19 insert in the Bacmid. \n\n Generation of hGPR1 19 Recombinant Baculovirus \n\n\nCreation of P0 Virus Stock \n\n\n Suspension adapted Sf9 cells grown in Sf900ll medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were transfected with 10 microL hGPR1 19 bacmid DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cellfectin, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After five days of incubation, the conditioned medium (i.e. \"P0\" virus stock) was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.22 μΠΊ filter (Steriflip, Millipore, Billerica, MA). \n\n\nCreation of Frozen Virus (BMC) Stocks \n\n\n For long term virus storage and generation of working (i.e. \"P1 \") viral stocks, frozen BMC (Baculovirus Infected Insect Cells) stocks were created as follows: suspension adapted Sf9 cells were grown in Sf900ll medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and infected with hGPR1 19 P0 virus stock. After 24 hours of growth, the infected cells were gently centrifuged (approximately 100 x g), resuspended in Freezing Medium (10% DMSO, 1 % Albumin in Sf900ll medium) to a final density of 1 x 10\n7\n cells/ml and frozen according to standard freezing protocols in 1 ml. aliquots. \n\n\nCreation of Working (\"Ρ1 Ί Virus Stock \n\n\n Suspension adapted Sf9 cells grown in Sf900ll medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were infected with a 1 :100 dilution of a thawed hGPR1 19 BMC stock and incubated for several days (27 degrees Celsius with shaking). When the viability of the cells reached 70%, the conditioned medium was harvested by centrifugation and the virus titer determined by ELISA (BaculoElisa Kit, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) \n\n\nOver-expression of hGPR1 19 in Suspension-Adapted HEK 293FT Cells \n\n\nHEK 293FT cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were grown in a shake flask in \n\n\n293Freestyle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 microg/mL neomycin and 10mM HEPES (37C, 8% carbon dioxide, shaking). The cells were centrifuged gently (approximately 500xg, 10 minutes) and the pellet resuspended in a mixture of \n\n\nDulbecco's PBS(minus Mg++/-Ca++) supplemented with 18% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich) and P1 virus such that the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 10 and the final cell density was 1.3 x 10\n6\n/ml (total volume 2.5 liters). The cells were transferred to a 5 liter Wave Bioreactor Wavebag (Wave Technologies, MA) and incubated for 4 hours at 27 degrees Celsius (17 rocks/min, 7 degrees platform angle); at the end of the incubation period, an equal volume(2.5 liters) of 293Freestyle medium supplemented \n\n with 30mM sodium butyrate (Sigma Aldrich) was added (final concentration = 15 mM), and the cells were grown for 20 hours (37 degrees Celsius, 8% C02 [0.2 liters/min}, 25 rocks/ minute, 7 degrees platform angle). Cells were harvested via centrifugation (3,000xg, 10 minutes), washed once on DPBS (minus Ca++/Mg++), resuspended in 0.25M sucrose, 25mM HEPES, 0.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4 and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. \n\n\nMembrane Preparation for Radioligand Binding Assays \n\n\n The frozen cells were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 700 x g (1400 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml phosphate- buffered saline, and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES (Gibco #15630), pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA (BioSolutions, #BIO260-15), 1 mM EGTA (Sigma, #E-4378), 0.01 mg/ml benzamidine (Sigma #B 6506), 0.01 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma #B 0125), 0.005 mg/ml leupeptin (Sigma #L 851 1 ), 0.005 mg/ml aprotinin (Sigma #A 1 153)) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Cells were then lysed with 15 gentle strokes of a tight-fitting glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 x g (2200 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was transferred into fresh centrifuge tubes on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and \n\n\ncentrifuged again at 1000 x g (2200 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius after which the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in homogenization buffer. This process was repeated a third time, after which the supernatants were combined, Benzonase (Novagen # 71206) and MgCI\n2\n (Fluka #63020) were added to final concentrations of 1 U/ml and 6 mM, respectively, and incubated on ice for one hour. The solution was then centrifuged at 25,000 x g (15000 rpm) for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh homogenization buffer (minus Benzonase and MgCI\n2\n). After repeating the 25,000 x g centrifugation step, the final membrane pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Pierce reagents A #23223 and B #23224). \n\n Synthesis and Purification of r\n3\nH1Cmpd A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A (\"Cmpd A\", isopropyl 4-(1 -(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1 H- pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-yloxy)piperidine-1 -carboxylate, as shown above) (4 mg, 0.009 mmol) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of dichloromethane, and the resulting solution was treated with (1 ,5-cyclooctadiene)(pyridine)(tricyclohexylphosphine)-iridium(l) hexaflurophosphate (J. Organometal. Chem. 1979, 168, 183) (5 mg, 0.006 mmol). The reaction vessel was sealed and the solution was stirred under an atmosphere of tritium gas for 17 hours. The reaction solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was dissolved in ethanol.

Baker #922401 ). 2 microL of each dilution was added to appropriate wells of a 96-well plate (each concentration in triplicate). Unlabeled Cmpd A, at a final concentration of 10 microM, was used to determine non-specific binding. \n\n\n \n3\nH-Cmpd A was diluted in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, (Sigma #T7443), 10 mM MgCI\n2\n (Fluka 63020), 1 mM EDTA (BioSolutions #BIO260-15), 0.15% bovine serum albumin (Sigma #A751 1 ), 0.01 mg/ml_ benzamidine (Sigma #B 6506), 0.01 mg/mL bacitracin (Sigma #B 0125), 0.005 mg/mL leupeptin (Sigma #L 851 1 ), 0.005 mg/mL aprotinin (Sigma #A 1 153)) to a concentration of 60 nM, and 100 microL added to all wells of 96-well plate (Nalge Nunc # 267245). \n\n\n Membranes expressing GPR1 19 were thawed and diluted to a final concentration of 20 μg/100 microL per well in Binding Buffer, and 100 microL of diluted membranes were added to each well of 96-well plate. \n\n\n The plate was incubated for 60 minutes w/shaking at room temperature (approximately 25 degrees Celsius). The assay was terminated by vacuum filtration onto GF/C filter plates (Packard # 6005174) presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenamine, using a Packard harvester. Filters were then washed six times using washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5 kept at 4 degrees Celsius). The filter plates were then air-dyed at room temperature overnight. 30 μΙ of scintillation fluid (Ready Safe, Beckman Coulter #141349) was added to each well, plates were sealed, and radioactivity associated with each filter was measured using a Wallac Trilux MicroBeta, plate-based scintillation counter. \n\n\n The Kd for \n3\nH-Cmpd A was determined by carrying out saturation binding, with data analysis by non-linear regression, fit to a one-site hyperbola (Graph Pad Prism). IC50 determinations were made from competition curves, analyzed with a proprietary curve \n\n fitting program (SIGHTS) and a 4-parameter logistic dose response equation.

The resulting solution was heated at 80 degrees Celsius overnight and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and heptane. The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with heptane. The combined heptane layers were washed sequentially with water and brine and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product as a yellow oil. The oil was purified by passing it through a plug of silica gel in 90:10 heptane/ethyl acetate to give the title compound as a colorless oil (33.6 g, 82%). \n1\n H NMR (400 MHz, deuterochloroform) delta 4.78 (br s, 1 H), 3.86 (br s, 2H), 3.51 (t, 2H), 2.09 (br s, 2H), 1.45 (s, 9H), 0.18 (s, 9H). \n\n Step B. te/t-Butyl-3-fluoro-4-oxopiperidine-1 -carboxylate (3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To a stirred solution of ieri-butyl-4-[(trimethylsilyl)oxy]-3,6-dihydropyridine-1 (2H)- carboxylate (28.8 g, 0.1 1 mol) in acetonitrile (300 mL) at room temperature was added\n\n\nSelectfluor™ (41 .4 g, 0.12 mol).

The resulting mixture was stirred at 0 degrees Celsius for 2 hours and then allowed to warm to room temperature. Saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (200 mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate.

Synthesis of 7-benzyl-3-oxa-7-azabicvclor3.3.1 lnonan-9-one - hydrochloride salt (2): \n\n\n A solution of tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one 1 (60.0 g, 0.60 mol), benzylamine (63.4 g, 0.60 mol) and glacial acetic acid (35.9 g, 0.60 mol) in dry methanol (1 .2 L) was added to a stirred suspension of paraformaldehyde (39.6 g, 1 .3 mol) in dry methanol (1 .2 L) over a period of 75 minutes at 65 degrees Celsius. A second portion of paraformaldehyde (39.6 g, 1 .3 mol) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 65 degrees Celsius. The reaction was quenched with water (1 .2 L) and 1 M aqueous potassium hydroxide solution (600 ml_). The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 L 3). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 20:1 ~ 2:1 ) to afford a brown oil. The residue was diluted with 6 M anhydrous hydrochloric acid in 1 ,4-dioxane (500 ml_), and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and acetone (500 ml.) was added. The resulting mixture was sonicated for 30 minutes causing a white precipitate to form. The mixture was filtered, and the solid was washed with acetone and then dried under vacuum to afford the desired product as a white solid (21 g, 13%): \n\n \n1\n H NMR (400 MHz, deuterium oxide) delta 7.43 - 7.42 (m, 5H), 4.66 (s, 2H), 3.95 - 3.90 (m, 4H), 3.54 - 3.47 (m, 4H); 1 .96 (bs, 2H); LCMS (ES+): 232.0 (M + 1 ). \n\n\nStep B of Scheme B.

The mixture was cooled with an ice bath, and sodium borohydride (1 .5 g, 37.3 mmol) was added in one portion. The mixture was allowed to warm slowly over 4 hours to room temperature. The reaction was then concentrated in vacuo to remove most of the ethanol and tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was partitioned between methyl te/t-butyl ether and aqueous 1 .0 M sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was stirred for 30 minutes followed by separation of the two layers. The aqueous layer was extracted with methyl terf-butyl ether. The organic extracts were combined, washed with brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give a clear oil, which partially solidified on standing to an oily white solid (3.71 g, 94 %).
