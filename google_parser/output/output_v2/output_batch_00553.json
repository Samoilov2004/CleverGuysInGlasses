Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/866,120 filed Nov. 16, 2006.\n\n\nThe present disclosure is generally directed to antiviral compounds, and more specifically directed to compounds which inhibit the function of the NS3 protease (also referred to herein as “serine protease”) encoded by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), compositions comprising such compounds, and methods for inhibiting the function of the NS3 protease.\n\n\nHCV is a major human pathogen, infecting an estimated 170 million persons worldwide—roughly five times the number infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. A substantial fraction of these HCV infected individuals develop serious progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n\nPresently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha-interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in 40% of patients. Recent clinical results demonstrate that pegylated alpha-interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy. However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load. Thus, there is a clear and unmet need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection.\n\n\nHCV is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Based on a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence and the extensive similarity in the 5′ untranslated region, HCV has been classified as a separate genus in the Flaviviridae family. All members of the Flaviviridae family have enveloped virions that contain a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins via translation of a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame.\n\n\nConsiderable heterogeneity is found within the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence throughout the HCV genome. Six major genotypes have been characterized, and more than 50 subtypes have been described. The major genotypes of HCV differ in their distribution worldwide, and the clinical significance of the genetic heterogeneity of HCV remains elusive despite numerous studies of the possible effect of genotypes on pathogenesis and therapy.\n\n\nThe single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a co-factor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A is essential for efficient polyprotein processing, enhancing the proteolytic cleavage at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.\n\n\nThe present disclosure provides peptide compounds that can inhibit the functioning of the NS3 protease, e.g., in combination with the NS4A protease.

Ingredients listed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth \ned., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1999) for example, may be used.\n\n\nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable risk/benefit ratio.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” means the total amount of each active component that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, e.g., a sustained reduction in viral load. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously.\n\n\nThe terms “treat” and “treating” refers to: (i) preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a patient which may be predisposed to the disease, disorder and/or condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting its development; and/or (iii) relieving the disease, disorder or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease, disorder and/or condition.\n\n\nWhere used in naming compounds of the present disclosure, the designations P1′, P1, P2, P2*, P3, and P4, as used herein, map the relative positions of the amino acid residues of a protease inhibitor binding relative to the binding of the natural peptide cleavage substrate. Cleavage occurs in the natural substrate between P1 and P1′ where the nonprime positions designate amino acids starting from the C-terminus end of the peptide natural cleavage site extending towards the N-terminus; whereas, the prime positions emanate from the N-terminus end of the cleavage site designation and extend toward the C-terminus. For example, P1′ refers to the first position away from the right hand end of the C-terminus of the cleavage site (i.e. N-terminus first position); whereas P1 starts the numbering from the left hand side of the C-terminus cleavage site, P2: second position from the C-terminus, etc.). (see Berger A. & Schechter I., Transactions of the Royal Society London series (1970), B257, 249-264].\n\n\nAsymmetric centers exist in the compounds of the present disclosure. For example, the compounds may include P1 cyclopropyl element of formula\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein C\n1 \nand C\n2 \neach represent an asymmetric carbon atom at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclopropyl ring.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIt should be understood that the disclosure encompasses all stereochemical forms, or mixtures thereof, which possess the ability to inhibit HCV protease.\n\n\n\nCertain compounds of the present disclosure may also exist in different stable conformational forms which may be separable. Torsional asymmetry due to restricted rotation about an asymmetric single bond, for example because of steric hindrance or ring strain, may permit separation of different conformers. The present disclosure includes each conformational isomer of these compounds and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nCertain compounds of the present disclosure may exist in zwitterionic form and the present disclosure includes each zwitterionic form of these compounds and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nWhen it is possible that, for use in therapy, therapeutically effective amounts of a compound of formula (I), as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be administered as the raw chemical, it is possible to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the disclosure further provides pharmaceutical compositions, which include therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are as described above. The carrier(s), diluent(s), or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 250 milligram per kilogram (“mg/kg”) body weight per day, preferably between about 0.05 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day of the compounds of the disclosure are typical in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending on the condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound employed, the duration of treatment, and the age, gender, weight, and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compound is most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford antivirally effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects.\n\n\nWhen the compositions of this disclosure comprise a combination of a compound of the disclosure and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agent, both the compound and the additional agent are usually present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 150%, and more preferably between about 10 and 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual, or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, intravenous, or intradermal injections or infusions) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s).\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions.\n\n\nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing, and coloring agent can also be present.\n\n\nCapsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.\n\n\nMoreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, betonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitable comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelating, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or and absorption agent such as betonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage, or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc, or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present disclosure can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.\n\n\nOral fluids such as solution, syrups, and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners, or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added.\n\n\nWhere appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax, or the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phopholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phophatidylcholines.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates, and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, or oils.\n\n\nFor treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in oil base.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges, pastilles, and mouth washes.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a course powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered, dose pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, or insufflators.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and soutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.

Compounds may be instrumental in providing research tools for designing of viral replication assays, validation of animal assay systems and structural biology studies to further enhance knowledge of the HCV disease mechanisms. Further, the compounds of the present disclosure are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other antiviral compounds, for example, by competitive inhibition.\n\n\nThe compounds of this disclosure may also be used to treat or prevent viral contamination of materials and therefore reduce the risk of viral infection of laboratory or medical personnel or patients who come in contact with such materials, e.g., blood, tissue, surgical instruments and garments, laboratory instruments and garments, and blood collection or transfusion apparatuses and materials.\n\n\nThis disclosure is intended to encompass compounds having formula (I) when prepared by synthetic processes or by metabolic processes including those occurring in the human or animal body (in vivo) or processes occurring in vitro.\n\n\nChemical abbreviations commonly used to identify chemical compounds disclosed herein include Bn: benzyl; Boc: tert-butyloxycarbonyl {Me\n3\nCOC(O)}; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CDI: carbonyldiimidazole; DBU: 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene; CH\n2\nCl\n2\n=DCM: methylene chloride; TBME: tert-butyl methyl ether; DEAD: diethylazodicarboxylate; DIAD: diisopropylazodicarboxylate; DIEA: diisopropylethylamine; DIPEA: diisopropylethylamine; 4-DMAP: 4-dimethylaminopyridine; DCC: 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; DMF: dimethylformamide; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide; DPPA: diphenylphosphoryl azide; Et: ethyl; EtOH: ethanol; EtOAc: ethyl acetate; Et\n2\nO: diethyl ether; Grubb's Catalyst: bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)benzylidene ruthenium (IV) dichloride; Grubb's 2\nnd \nGeneration Catalyst: tricyclohexylphosphine[1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene][benzylidene]ruthenium (IV) dichloride; HATU: [O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HBTU: [O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HOBT, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; HOAT, 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole; HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography; MS: mass spectrometry; Me: methyl; MeOH: methanol; NMM: N-methylmorpholine; NMP: N-methylpyrrolidine; Pr: propyl; PPA: polyphosphoric acid; TBAF: tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride; 1,2-DCE or DCE: 1,2-dichloroethane; TFA: trifluoroacetic acid; THF: tetrahydrofuran.\n\n\nThe starting materials useful to synthesize the compounds of the present disclosure are known to those skilled in the art and can be readily manufactured or are commercially available.\n\n\nThe following methods set forth below are provided for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. It will be recognized that it may be necessary to prepare such a compound in which a functional group is protected using a conventional protecting group then to remove the protecting group to provide a compound of the present disclosure. The details concerning the use of protecting groups in accordance with the present disclosure are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 1, intermediates of the present disclosure such as dipeptide (1), can be used for the preparation of compounds of formula (I). In the first step of this process the Boc protected nitrogen of (1) is deprotected using an acid such as HCl in a solvent such as ether, to provide the corresponding free amine 2. Amine (2) can be subsequently coupled to amino acid (3) using a coupling agent such as HATU in a solvent such as dichloromethane to provide the tripeptide intermediate (4). It should be noted that in some cases intermediates like (3) are commercially available, and alternatively such compounds can be readily prepared in racemic or chiral fashion by methods known in the art. A key transformation in the construction of compounds of formula (I) is the macrocyclization process wherein intermediates of general structure (4) are converted into intermediates of general structure (5). In the general example cited, the conversion of intermediate (4) into (5) can be affected by an intramolecular olefin metathesis reaction. This class of reactions is well established in the art and as such, a number of olefin-metathesis-catalysts have been developed and are commercially available. For example the conversion of diene (4) to macrocycle (5) could be affected by the treatment of (4) with a sufficient quantity of Grubb's first-generation olefin metathesis catalyst, in a solvent such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane. In some examples for the conversion of (4) to (5), it may be necessary to heat the reaction mixture in order to effect this cyclization process. Intermediate (5) is then converted to compounds of formula (I) such as (7) by a two step process. In the first step of this process, the ester functionality of intermediate (5) is hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid (6). This transformation can be accomplished by a saponification reaction wherein (5) is treated with a base such as lithium hydroxide in a mixture of THF, methanol and water. The resulting acid (6) can be converted to a compound of formula (I) by a simple coupling reaction with a sulfonamide derivative as shown. For example, it is well established in the art that treatment of a carboxylic acid like (6), with CDI in a solvent such as methylene chloride, generates in situ a reactive intermediate which when treated with a sulfonamide provides for (7), a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, in the above final coupling process, that is in the conversion of (6) to (7), the R\n7\nSO\n2\nNH\n2 \nentity is a sulfamide derivative, as for example R\na\nR\nb\nNSO\n2\nNH\n2\n, then an alternative coupling procedure can be used. Therein the sulfamide intermediate (1) (Scheme 2) is first deprotonated using a base such as lithium bishexamethyldisilane in a solvent such as THF. The resulting THF solution of sulfamide anion (2) is then added to the aforementioned reaction mixture containing the activated carboxylic acid. This reaction mixture is then stirred for several hours to provide the requisite acylsulfamide (7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) can also be converted into other compounds of formula I as described herein. An example of such a process is shown in Scheme 3, wherein a compound of formula I (1) which bears a Boc group at the P4 position is converted into a compound of formula I (3) wherein said compound bears a urea group at the P4 position. The conversion of (1) to (3) can be carried out in a two step process the first of which is the conversion of (1) to amine (2) by treatment of (1) with an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting amine TFA salt can be treated with an isocyanate in the presence of one equivalent of base to provide a compound of formula I (3) wherein the P3 moiety is capped with a urea. As previously noted one skilled in the art will recognize that intermediate (2) can be used as starting material for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) wherein the P3 group is capped with an amide or a carbamate. The construction of said compounds of formula (I) can be achieved using standard conditions for the formation of said P4 functionalities from amines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-limiting procedures for making P2 intermediates and compounds of formula (I) are shown in the Schemes below. Said intermediates, reaction conditions and methods given in the specific examples are broadly applicable to compounds with other substitution patterns. For example, the synthesis the P2 elements found in compounds of formula (I) of Scheme 4 can be prepared following the defined synthetic path. Therein commercially available N-Boc-4-oxo-L-proline is treated with an organometallic agent such as a Grignard reagent (or alternatively an alkyl or aryl lithium species, or alternatively an alkyl, or aryl zinc species) to provide intermediate (2) in which the C4 position of the proline bears an R\n3 \nsubstituent and a free tertiary hydroxy group. Intermediate (2) can then be converted into compounds of formula (I).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) where R\n4 \nis a hydrogen can be synthesized from the corresponding compound of formula (I) where R\n4 \nis a hydroxy group. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) wherein R\n4 \nis a hydrogen can be synthesized from any of the intermediates used for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n4 \nis a hydroxy group. For example compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n4 \nis a hydrogen can be prepared as shown in Scheme 5. Said compounds (3) can be prepared from the corresponding hydroxy analogues (1). The process for the formation of compounds like (3) from compounds like (1) requires a reduction, or deoxygenation of the proline C4 hydroxy group. There is considerable art established for the reduction and or deoxygenation of alcohols and particularly tertiary alcohols that could provide for the formation of compounds like (3) from compounds like (1). For example the direct reduction of alcohols to the corresponding alkane (Process 1 of Scheme 5) has been reported in the following reference: \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2001, 66, 7741. Therein the reduction of alcohols to alkanes is described wherein said alcohol is treated with chlorodiphenylsilane and a catalytic amount of indium trichloride in a solvent such as dichloroethane to provide the corresponding alkane. Said reaction can be conducted at room temperature, but in some cases heating may be required. An alternative process for the formation of compounds of formula (I), wherein R\n4 \nis a hydrogen, from compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n4 \nis a hydroxy group, is shown as Process 2 in Scheme 5. Therein compounds like (1) are first converted to activated alcohols (2) and these intermediates are reduced to the corresponding alkane (for example using a Barton deoxygenation process). Alternatively, activated alcohols as shown in (2) can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes as for example using reducing agents. These processes for the conversion of (1) to (3) in Scheme 5 are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the addition of organometallic agents to the ketone moiety of proline derivative 1 (Scheme 6) is well established in the art. For example, Hruby and co-workers (\nJ. Org. Chem. \n2001, 66, 3593) have described the addition of phenylmagnesium bromide to intermediates of general structure (1) of Scheme 6. These findings provide evidence that optimal yields of the desired 1,2 addition products ((2), of Scheme 6) are obtained when a tert-butyl ester group is employed as a protecting group of the C2 carboxyl moiety. In addition, this work provided clear evidence in the form of X-ray crystallography as to the stereochemical outcome of this addition reaction. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned Grignard addition to ketone (1), a single product was obtained wherein the C4 hydroxyl group and the C2 carboxyl group assume a syn relative orientation about the five membered ring. From this structure determination the face selectivity in the addition of R\n3\nM to the ketone of (1) was deduced to be alpha in the context of structure (1) of Scheme 6. That is, the organometallic selectively adds to the re-face (bottom face) of the carbonyl in (1) to provide the corresponding tertiary alcohol (2) with the stereochemistry shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned work of Hruby describes the addition of a specific Grignard reagent to derivatives of (1) (Scheme 6). However, the addition of a variety of Grignard reagents to proline (1) is encompassed in the present disclosure. The body of literature that describes the addition of organometallic agents, including Grignard reagents, to ketones is considerable and is summarized in general overviews in the art such as: \nComprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations\n. Volume 2\n: Synthesis: Carbon with one heteroatom attached by a single bond\n. Editor in Chief Alan. R. Katritzky, et al. 1995. Chapter 2.02, page 37. This class of reactions is also described in \nComprehensive Organic Synthesis\n. Editor in Chief Barry M Trost, Volume 1: Additions to C—X pi-bonds (part 1). 1991.\n\n\nRecent research in the art provides conditions for further optimization of Grignard reagents in addition reactions to ketones and these works may be useful in the present disclosure. For example, Ishihara and co-workers (\nOrg. Lett. \n2005, Vol. 7, No. 4, 573) recently described the formation and utility of magnesium ate complexes. Magnesium ate comples, R\n3\nMgLi, are derived from Grignard reagents and alkyllithiums. As described by Ishihara these complexes provide excellent yields of 1,2 addition products in reactions to ketones. In a separate study, Knochel and co-workers (\nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n2006, 45, 497) have described the use of soluble Lanthanide salts such as LnCl\n3 \nin conjunction with organomagnesium reagents. The presence of these Lanthanide salts results in an improvement in the efficiency of the 1,2 addition reaction to carbonyl compounds. These works, and references cited therein, establish the state of the art with respect to the optimization of the Grignard reaction in simple additions to carbonyl compounds and serve as an important source of information in the present disclosure.\n\n\nIt should also be noted that a range of organometallic reagents participate in addition reactions to ketones. Included in this body of work are reagents such as aryllithium, alkyllithium and heteroaryllithium reagents, which are well known to add in a 1,2 fashion to carbonyl moieties. For example, in a recent study by Dondoni and co-workers (\nJ. Org. Chem. \n2005, 70, 9257) benzothioazole is lithiated using BuLi and the resulting C2-lithium species adds in a 1,2 fashion to a lactone. By way of analogy lithiated benzothiazole would be expected to add in a 1,2 fashion to ketone (1) of Scheme 6 to provide an intermediate like (2a).\n\n\nOne skilled in the art would recognize that organometallic reagents derived from heterocycles such as oxazoles and thiazoles and imidazoles can also participate in 1,2 addition reactions to ketone (1). There is a considerable body of literature that defines the unique conditions employed for each of these heterocycle systems and this information is readily available to one skilled in the art. For example, the use of organometallic reagents derived from benzoxazole or oxazole, in addition reactions to ketones requires the use of lithium magnesates. The specifics of this recent study by Bayh and co-workers is described in \nJ. Org. Chem., \n2005, 70, 5190. The addition of benzoxazole to ketone (1) of Scheme 6 would provide access to intermediates like (2b).\n\n\nThere is significant literature precedent for the addition to ketones using a wide range of organometallic reagents derived from heterocycles. For example the work of Behinda and co-workers (Tet. Lett. 42, 2001, 647) describes the formation of a lithiated benzimidazole and its addition to a simple lactone. By analogy, the use of this lithiated benzimidazole in addition reactions to ketone (1) of Scheme 6 would provide access to intermediates like (2c). In addition, a recent study by Kawasaki and co-workers (\nBioorganic and Medicinal Chem. Lett. \n13, 2003, 87) describes the formation of a series of lithiated heteroaromatic compounds and their addition reactions to activated amides. By analogy the use of these lithiated heteroaromatic intermediates in addition reactions to ketone (1) of Scheme 6 would provide access to intermediates (2d-2k).\n\n\nThe employment of organometallics derived from biaryl, or heteroaryl-aryl systems in addition 1,2 reactions to ketone (1) is also pertinent to the present disclosure. The addition of this class of organometallic reagents to ketone (1) would provide access to intermediates like (2l) and (2m). It should be noted that in the exemplification of the present disclosure, it may be necessary to synthesize biaryl, or hetero-aryl organometallics for subsequent use in addition reactions to ketone (1) of Scheme 6. One skilled in the art would recognize the significant body of literature which describes the preparation of organometallics of this type and precursors thereof. For example a recent review by Chinchilla and co-workers (\nChem. Rev. \n2004, 104, 2667) describes the preparation of metalated heterocycles and their utility. The basic chemistry for the preparation of biaryl or heteroaryl-aryl systems often employ Suzuki like coupling reactions. A body of literature put forth by Gregory Fu describes the state of the art in such coupling reactions and a subset of these references follow: \nJACS \n2004, 126, 1340\n; JACS, \n2002, 124, 13662\n; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n2002, 41, No. 11, 1945\n; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n2002, 41, No. 20, 3910\n; JACS \n2002, 122, 4020\n; JACS \n2001, 123, 10099\n; Org. Lett. \n2001, Vol. 3, No. 26, 4295\n; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n1998, 37, No. 24, 3387. In addition to this body of work critical reviews in the area are readily available such as by Rossi in \nSynthesis \n2004, No. 15, 2419.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe present disclosure will now be described in connection with certain embodiments which are not intended to limit its scope.

The filtrate was concentrated and purified by prep-HPLC to afford 4.1 mg (8%) of the desired product as a white solid. \n1\nH NMR (CD\n3\nOD) δ 0.87-1.10 (m, 4H), 1.24-1.38 (m, 2H), 1.45 (s, 9H), 1.49-1.52 (m, 4H), 1.70-1.84 (m, 4H), 1.99-2.10 (m, 1H), 2.22-2.35 (m, 1H), 2.40-2.60 (m, 2H), 2.70-2.80 (m, 1H), 2.90-2.99 (m, 1H), 4.08-4.11 (m, 1H), 4.31-4.41 (m, 2H), 4.61-4.69 (m, 1H), 5.23-5.32 (m, 1H), 5.61-5.70 (m, 1H), 7.35-7.38 (m, 1H), 7.43-7.48 (m, 2H), 7.62-7.70 (m, 6H); LC-MS (retention time: 2.74 min, method B), MS m/z 703 (M\n+\n+H—H\n2\nO), 647 (M\n+\n+H—H\n2\nO-t-Butyl).\n\n\nBiological Studies\n\n\nHCV NS3/4A protease complex enzyme assays and cell-based HCV replicon assays were utilized in the present disclosure, and were prepared, conducted and validated as follows:\n\n\nGeneration of Recombinant HCV NS3/4A Protease Complex\n\n\nHCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS strain, H77 strain or J4L6S strain, were generated, as described below. These purified recombinant proteins were generated for use in a homogeneous assay (see below) to provide an indication of how effective compounds of the present disclosure would be in inhibiting HCV NS3 proteolytic activity.\n\n\nSerum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained from Dr. T. Wright, San Francisco Hospital. An engineered full-length cDNA (compliment deoxyribonucleic acid) template of the HCV genome (BMS strain) was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA (ribonucleic acid) and using primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype 1a strains. From the determination of the entire genome sequence, a genotype 1a was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (See P Simmonds, K A Rose, S Graham, S W Chan, F McOmish, B C Dow, E A Follett, P L Yap and H Marsden, J. Clin. Microbiol., 31(6), 1493-1503 (1993)). The amino acid sequence of the nonstructural region, NS2-5B, was shown to be >97% identical to HCV genotype 1a (H77) and 87% identical to genotype 1b (J4L6S). The infectious clones, H77 (1a genotype) and J4L6S (1b genotype) were obtained from R. Purcell (NIH) and the sequences are published in Genbank (AAB67036, see Yanagi, M., Purcell, R. H., Emerson, S. U. and Bukh, J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94(16), 8738-8743 (1997); AF054247, see Yanagi, M., St Claire, M., Shapiro, M., Emerson, S. U., Purcell, R. H. and Bukh, J, Virology 244 (1), 161-172. (1998)).\n\n\nThe H77 and J4L6S strains were used for production of recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes. DNA encoding the recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex (amino acids 1027 to 1711) for these strains were manipulated as described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Paolini C, Brennan D, Nardi C, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 38(17):5620-32, (1999)). Briefly, a three-lysine solubilizing tail was added at the 3′-end of the NS4A coding region. The cysteine in the P1 position of the NS4A-NS4B cleavage site (amino acid 1711) was changed to a glycine to avoid the proteolytic cleavage of the lysine tag. Furthermore, a cysteine to serine mutation was introduced by PCR at amino acid position 1454 to prevent the autolytic cleavage in the NS3 helicase domain. The variant DNA fragment was cloned in the pET21b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) and the NS3/4A complex was expressed in \nEscherichia. coli \nstrain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) following the protocol described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Brennan D, Nardi C, Brunetti M, Tomei L, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R., J. Virol. 72(8):6758-69 (1998)) with modifications. Briefly, the NS3/4A protease complex expression was induced with 0.5 millimolar (mM) Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 22 hours (h) at 20° C. A typical fermentation (1 Liter (L)) yielded approximately 10 grams (g) of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mL/g) consisting of 25 mM N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-Ethane Sulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 500 mM Sodium Chloride (NaCl), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 microgram/milliliter (“μg/mL”) lysozyme, 5 mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCl\n2\n), 1 μg/ml DnaseI, 5 mM β-Mercaptoethanol (βME), Protease inhibitor-Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic acid (EDTA) free (Roche), homogenized and incubated for 20 minutes (min) at 4° C. The homogenate was sonicated and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 235000 g for 1 hour (h) at 4° C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 15 mM and the pH adjusted to 8.0. The crude protein extract was loaded on a Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column pre-equilibrated with buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 15 mM imidazole, 5 mM βME). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer C (same as buffer B except with 0.2% Triton X-100). The protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer D (same as buffer C except with 200 mM Imidazole).\n\n\nNS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and loaded on a desalting column Superdex-S200 pre-equilibrated with buffer D (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mM βME). Sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. NS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to approximately 0.5 mg/ml. The purity of the NS3/4A protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77 and J4L6S strains, were judged to be greater than 90% by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses. The enzyme was stored at −80° C., thawed on ice and diluted prior to use in assay buffer.\n\n\nFRET Peptide Assay to Monitor HCV NS3/4A Proteolytic Activity\n\n\nThe purpose of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS strain, H77 strain or J4L6S strain, as described above, by compounds of the present disclosure. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present disclosure would be in inhibiting HCV NS3 proteolytic activity.\n\n\nIn order to monitor HCV NS3/4A protease activity, an NS3/4A peptide substrate was used. The substrate was RET SI (Resonance Energy Transfer Depsipeptide Substrate; AnaSpec, Inc. cat #22991) (FRET peptide), described by Taliani et al. in Anal. Biochem. 240(2):60-67 (1996). The sequence of this peptide is loosely based on the NS4A/NS4B natural cleavage site for the HCV NS3 protease except there is an ester linkage rather than an amide bond at the cleavage site. The peptide also contains a fluorescence donor, EDANS, near one end of the peptide and an acceptor, DABCYL, near the other end. The fluorescence of the peptide is quenched by intermolecular resonance energy transfer (RET) between the donor and the acceptor, but as the NS3 protease cleaves the peptide the products are released from RET quenching and the fluorescence of the donor becomes apparent.\n\n\nThe peptide substrate was incubated with one of the three recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes, in the absence or presence of a compound of the present disclosure. The inhibitory effects of a compound were determined by monitoring the formation of fluorescent reaction product in real time using a Cytofluor Series 4000.\n\n\nThe reagents were as follow: HEPES and Glycerol (Ultrapure) were obtained from GIBCO-BRL. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) was obtained from Sigma. β-Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Bio Rad.\n\n\nAssay buffer: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl; 0.1% Triton; 15% Glycerol; 10 mM βME. Substrate: 2 μM final concentration (from a 2 mM stock solution in DMSO stored at −20° C.). HCV NS3/4A protease type 1a (1b), 2-3 nM final concentration (from a 5 μM stock solution in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X100, 10 mM βME). For compounds with potencies approaching the assay limit, the assay was made more sensitive by adding 50 μg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) to the assay buffer and reducing the end protease concentration to 300 μM.\n\n\nThe assay was performed in a 96-well polystyrene black plate from Falcon. Each well contained 25 μl NS3/4A protease complex in assay buffer, 50 μl of a compound of the present disclosure in 10% DMSO/assay buffer and 25 μl substrate in assay buffer. A control (no compound) was also prepared on the same assay plate. The enzyme complex was mixed with compound or control solution for 1 min before initiating the enzymatic reaction by the addition of substrate. The assay plate was read immediately using the Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosystems). The instrument was set to read an emission of 340 nm and excitation of 490 nm at 25° C. Reactions were generally followed for approximately 15 min.\n\n\nThe percent inhibition was calculated with the following equation:\n\n\n100−[(δF\ninh\n/δF\ncon\n)×100]\n\n\nwhere δF is the change in fluorescence over the linear range of the curve. A non-linear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC\n50\n) was calculated by the use of Excel XLfit software using the equation, y=A+((B−A)/(1+((C/x)^D))).\n\n\n\nSpecificity Assays\n\n\nThe specificity assays were performed to demonstrate the in vitro selectivity of the compounds of the present disclosure in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease complex as compared to other serine or cysteine proteases.\n\n\nThe specificities of compounds of the present disclosure were determined against a variety of serine proteases: human neutrophil elastase (HNE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and human pancreatic chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases a 96-well plate format protocol using a fluorometric Amino-Methyl-Coumarin (AMC) substrate specific for each enzyme was used as described previously (PCT Patent Application No. WO 00/09543) with some modifications to the serine protease assays. All enzymes were purchased from Sigma, EMDbiosciences while the substrates were from Bachem, Sigma and EMDbiosciences.\n\n\nCompound concentrations varied from 100 to 0.4 μM depending on their potency. The enzyme assays were each initiated by addition of substrate to enzyme-inhibitor pre-incubated for 10 min at room temperature and hydrolysis to 15% conversion as measured on cytofluor.\n\n\nThe final conditions for each assay were as follows:\n\n\n50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) pH 8, 0.5 M Sodium Sulfate (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3% DMSO, 0.01% Tween-20 with 5 μM LLVY-AMC and 1 nM Chymotrypsin.\n\n\n50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3% DMSO, 0.02% Tween-20, 5 μM succ-AAPV-AMC and 20 nM HNE or 8 nM PPE;\n\n\n100 mM NaOAC (Sodium Acetate) pH 5.5, 3% DMSO, 1 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), 5 nM Cathepsin B (enzyme stock activated in buffer containing 20 mM TCEP before use), and 2 μM Z-FR-AMC diluted in H\n2\nO.\n\n\nThe percentage of inhibition was calculated using the formula:\n\n\n[1−((UV\ninh\n−UV\nblank\n)/(UV\nctl\n−UV\nblank\n))]×100\n\n\n\nA non-linear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC\n50\n) was calculated by the use of Excel XLfit software.\n\n\nGeneration of HCV Replicon\n\n\nAn HCV replicon whole cell system was established as described by Lohmann V, Korner F, Koch J, Herian U, Theilmann L, Bartenschlager R., Science 285(5424):110-3 (1999). This system enabled us to evaluate the effects of our HCV Protease compounds on HCV RNA replication. Briefly, using the HCV strain 1b sequence described in the Lohmann paper (Accession number: AJ238799), an HCV cDNA was synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, Calif.), and the full-length replicon was then assembled in plasmid pGem9zf(+) (Promega, Madison, Wis.) using standard molecular biology techniques. The replicon consists of (i) the HCV 5′ UTR fused to the first 12 amino acids of the capsid protein, (ii) the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo), (iii) the IRES from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and (iv) HCV NS3 to NS5B genes and the HCV 3′ UTR. Plasmid DNAs were linearized with ScaI and RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using the T7 MegaScript transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) according to manufacturer's directions. In vitro transcripts of the cDNA were transfected into the human hepatoma cell line, HUH-7. Selection for cells constitutively expressing the HCV replicon was achieved in the presence of the selectable marker, neomycin (G418). Resulting cell lines were characterized for positive and negative strand RNA production and protein production over time.\n\n\nHCV Replicon FRET Assay\n\n\nThe HCV replicon FRET assay was developed to monitor the inhibitory effects of compounds described in the disclosure on HCV viral replication. HUH-7 cells, constitutively expressing the HCV replicon, were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) (Gibco-BRL) containing 10% Fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml G418 (Gibco-BRL). Cells were seeded the night before (1.5×10\n4 \ncells/well) in 96-well tissue-culture sterile plates. Compound and no compound controls were prepared in DMEM containing 4% FCS, 1:100 Penicillin/Streptomysin (Gibco-BRL), 1:100 L-glutamine and 5% DMSO in the dilution plate (0.5% DMSO final concentration in the assay). Compound/DMSO mixes were added to the cells and incubated for 4 days at 37° C. After 4 days, cells were first assessed for cytotoxicity using alamar Blue (Trek Diagnotstic Systems) for a CC\n50 \nreading. The toxicity of compound (CC\n50\n) was determined by adding 1/10\nth \nvolume of alamar Blue to the media incubating the cells. After 4 h, the fluorescence signal from each well was read, with an excitation wavelength at 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 580 nm, using the Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosystems). Plates were then rinsed thoroughly with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (3 times 150 μl). The cells were lysed with 25 μl of a lysis assay reagent containing an HCV protease substrate (5× cell Luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega #E153A) diluted to 1× with distilled water, NaCl added to 150 mM final, the FRET peptide substrate (as described for the enzyme assay above) diluted to 10 μM final from a 2 mM stock in 100% DMSO. The plate was then placed into the Cytofluor 4000 instrument which had been set to 340 nm excitation/490 nm emission, automatic mode for 21 cycles and the plate read in a kinetic mode. EC\n50 \ndeterminations were carried out as described for the IC\n50 \ndeterminations.\n\n\nHCV Replicon Luciferase Reporter Assay\n\n\nAs a secondary assay, EC\n50 \ndeterminations from the replicon FRET assay were confirmed in a replicon luciferase reporter assay. Utilization of a replicon luciferase reporter assay was first described by Krieger et al (Krieger N, Lohmann V, and Bartenschlager R, J. Virol. 75(10):4614-4624 (2001)). The replicon construct described for our FRET assay was modified by inserting cDNA encoding a humanized form of the \nRenilla luciferase \ngene and a linker sequence fused directly to the 3′-end of the luciferase gene. This insert was introduced into the replicon construct using an AscI restriction site located in core, directly upstream of the neomycin marker gene. The adaptive mutation at position 1179 (serine to isoleucine) was also introduced (Blight K J, Kolykhalov, A A, Rice, C M, Science 290(5498):1972-1974). A stable cell line constitutively expressing this HCV replicon construct was generated as described above. The luciferase reporter assay was set up as described for the HCV replicon FRET assay with the following modifications. Following 4 days in a 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nincubator, cells were analyzed for \nRenilla Luciferase \nactivity using the Promega Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System. Media (100 μl) was removed from each well containing cells. To the remaining 50 μl of media, 50 μl of Dual-Glo Luciferase Reagent was added, and plates rocked for 10 min to 2 h at room temperature. Dual-Glo Stop & Glo Reagent (50 μl) was then added to each well, and plates were rocked again for an additional 10 min to 2 h at room temperature. Plates were read on a Packard TopCount NXT using a luminescence program.\n\n\nThe percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula below:\n\n\n% control=average luciferase signal in experimental wells(+compound)/average luciferase signal in DMSO control wells(−compound)\n\n\nThe values were graphed and analyzed using XLfit to obtain the EC\n50 \nvalue.\n\n\n\nNote that by using the patent example number and the patent compound number shown in Table 2 the structures of compounds can be found herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample Number\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n87\n\n\n1\n\n\n18\n\n\n639\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n88\n\n\n2\n\n\n9\n\n\n389\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n89\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be evident to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure is not limited to the foregoing illustrative examples, and that it can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the essential attributes thereof.
