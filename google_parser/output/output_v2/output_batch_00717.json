In addition it is now well recognized that cognitive impairment is the third major diagnostic category of schizophrenia, characterized by loss in working memory as well as other deficits. Other symptoms include aggressiveness, depression and anxiety (Stahl, S. M. (2000) Essential Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications. Cambridge University Press, second edition, Cambridge, UK). The different categories and the clinical features of the disorder are defined in diagnostic schemes such as DSM-IV (Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4\nth \nedition) or ICD-10 (International classification of diseases, 10\nth \nedition). Currently used medications to treat schizophrenia, bipolar mania and other psychoses, include antipsychotics both typical (D\n2\n/D\n3 \npreferring) or the more recent atypicals, which exhibit polypharmacology interacting at multiple receptors (e.g., D\n1\n, D\n2\n, D\n3\n, D\n4\n, 5-HT\n1A\n, 5-HT\n2A\n, 5-HT\n2C\n, H\n1\n, M\n1\n, M\n2\n, M\n4\n, etc; Roth, B. L. et al. (2004) Magic shotguns versus magic bullets: selectively non-selective drugs for mood disorders and schizophrenia. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 3, 353-359). These antipsychotics, although relatively successful (some patients exhibit treatment resistance) at treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, are less effective at treating negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, and associated depression and anxiety, all of which lead to reduced patient quality of life and socioeconomic problems (Lieberman, J. A. et al. Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) Investigators. (2005) Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia. N. Engl. J. Med. 353, 1209-1223). Furthermore, patient compliance is compromised by prevalent side effects such as weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and cardiovascular effects (Lieberman, J. A. et al. Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) Investigators. (2005) Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia. N. Engl. J. Med. 353, 1209-1223). In the current invention, compounds with high affinity and greater selectivity for D\n3 \nand 5-HT\n2A \nreceptors are described and are proposed to treat psychoses and other diseases, with fewer associated side affects.\n\n\nDopamine, a major catecholamine neurotransmitter, is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions which include emotion, cognition, motor functions, and positive reinforcement, (Purves, D. et al. (2004) Neuroscience. Sinauer, third edition, Sunderland, Mass.). The biological activities of dopamine are mediated through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and in human, five different dopamine receptors D\n1\n-D\n5 \nhave been identified, where the D\n2\n-like receptors (D\n2\n, D\n3 \nand D\n4\n) couple to the G-protein G\nα1 \n(Missale, C. et al. (1998) Dopamine receptors: from structure to function. Physiol. Rev. 78, 189-225). The D\n3 \ndopamine receptor is most highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens (Gurevich, E. V., Joyce, J. N. (1999) Distribution of dopamine D3 receptor expressing neurons in the human forebrain: comparison with D2 receptor expressing neurons. Neuropsychopharmacology 20, 60-80), and is proposed to modulate the mesolimbic pathway consisting of neuronal projections from the ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and amygdala to the nucleus accumbens, which projects to the prefrontal and cingulate cortices as well as various thalamic nuclei.\n\n\nThe limbic circuit is thought to be important for emotional behavior and thus D\n3 \nreceptor antagonists are proposed to modulate psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder (Joyce, J. N. and Millan, M. J., (2005) Dopamine D3 receptor antagonists as therapeutic agents. Drug Discovery Today, 1 Jul., Vol. 10, No. 13, 917-25), while these antagonists spare the D\n2 \nmodulated striatal extrapyramidal system (associated with EPS induction). In addition, it has been reported that drug naive schizophrenic patients show altered levels of D\n3 \nreceptor expression (Gurevich, E. V. et al. (1997) Mesolimbic dopamine D3 receptors and use of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia. A postmortem study. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 54, 225-232) and dopamine release (Laruelle, M. (2000) Imaging dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia: implication for treatment. Presented at Workshop Schizophr.: Pathol. Bases and Mech. Antipsychotic Action, Chicago), indicating that a disturbed homeostasis of dopamine plays an important role in the etiology of schizophrenic symptoms.\n\n\nThe neurotransmitter serotonin is implicated in several psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia (Kandel, E. R. et al. (eds.; 2000) Principles of Neural Science, 3\nrd \nedition Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn.). The involvement of serotonin in psychotic disorders is suggested by multiple studies which include treatment in humans with the psychotropic drug Lysergic acid (LSD; a serotonin agonist) which can induce schizophrenia-like symptoms such as hallucinations (Leikin, J. B. et al. (1989) Clinical features and management of intoxication due to hallucinogenic drugs. Med. Toxicol. Adverse Drug Exp. 4, 324-350).\n\n\nFurthermore, altered brain distribution of serotonin receptors as well as an altered serotonergic tone, have been detected in schizophrenic patients (Harrison, P. J. (1999) Neurochemical alterations in schizophrenia affecting the putative receptor targets of atypical antipsychotics. Focus on dopamine (D1, D3, D4) and 5-HT\n2A \nreceptors. Br. J. Psychiatry Suppl. 38, 12-22).\n\n\nIn mammals serotonin exerts its biological activities through a family of 14 5-HT GPCRs (Barnes, N. M., Sharp, T. (1999) A review of central 5-HT receptors and their function. Neuropharmacology 38, 1083-1152). The 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor is most prominently expressed in the prefrontal cortex and at lower levels in the basal ganglia and the hippocampus in human brain (Pompeiano, M. et al. (1994) Distribution of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptor family mRNAs: comparison between 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Brain Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 23, 163-178; Pazos, A., Probst, A., Palacios, J. M. (1987) Serotonin receptors in the human brain—IV. Autoradiographic mapping of serotonin-2 receptors. Neuroscience 21, 123-139), and is coupled predominantly to the G-protein G\nαq \n(Roth, B. L. et al. (1998) 5-Hydroxytryptamine2-family receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine2A, 5-hydroxytryptamine2B, 5-hydroxytryptamine2C): where structure meets function. Pharmacol. Ther. 79, 231-257).\n\n\nGenetic linkage studies of a 5-HT\n2A \npolymorphism to schizophrenia (Spurlock, G. et al. (1998) A family based association study of T102C polymorphism in 5HT2A and schizophrenia plus identification of new polymorphisms in the promoter. Mol. Psychiatry. 3, 42-49), as well as responsiveness to antipsychotic drugs (Arranz, M. J. et al. (2000) Pharmacogenetic prediction of clozapine response. Lancet 355, 1615-1616), further suggests a role for the 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor both in the treatment and pathology of psychosis. In addition, dopaminergic neurotransmission appears to be under the afferent regulation of the 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor (Porras, G. et al. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C/2B receptor subtypes modulate dopamine release induced in vivo by amphetamine and morphine in both the rat nucleus accumbens and striatum. Neuropsychopharmacology 26, 311-324-2002). Overall 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor antagonists are proposed to be suitable for the treatment of disorders associated with dysfunctional dopaminergic systems. Moreover, 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor antagonism has been recognized as beneficial for the treatment of psychosis (reviewed in de Angelis, L. (2002) 5-HT2A antagonists in psychiatric disorders. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs 3, 106-112) and indeed is one of the defining features of so-called atypical antipsychotic drugs which are characterized by a relatively high affinity for the 5-HT\n2A\n—relative to the D\n2 \nreceptor (Meltzer, H. Y. et al. (1989) Classification of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on the basis of dopamine D-1, D-2 and serotonin2 pKi values. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 251, 238-246).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds of formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n \n \nA is aryl or 5 to 6 membered heteroaryl each of which is optionally substituted by one to five substitutents selected from the group consisting of cyano, halo, C\n1-6\n-alkyl, C\n1-6\n-haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n-alkylsulfonyl and C\n1-6\n-alkoxy;\n \nn is 1, 2, 3 or 4;\n \np is 1, 2, 3 or 4;\n \nq is 0 or 1;\n \nr is 0, 1, 2 or 3;\n \nR\n1 \nis C\n2-6\n-alkenyl or C\n2-6\n-alkynyl each of which is optionally substituted by aryl,\n \n\n\nor is C\n1-6\n-alkyl optionally substituted by one to five substitutents selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \nhalo,\n \nhydroxy,\n \nC\n1-6\n-alkyl,\n \nC\n1-6\n-haloalkyl,\n \n—CO(O)—C\n1-6\n-alkyl,\n \nC\n3-10\n-cycloalkyl,\n \nC\n1-6\n-alkoxy optionally substituted by one, two or three halo or substituted by aryl,\n \naryl optionally substituted by halo or C\n1-6\n-alkoxy,\n \n5 to 10 membered heteroaryl optionally substituted by C\n1-6\n-alkyl, and phenoxy,\n \nor is C\n1-6\n-alkoxy,\n \nor is C\n3-10\n-cycloalkyl optionally substituted by one or more R\na\n,\n \nor is 4 to 10 membered heterocycloalkyl optionally substituted by one or more R\na\n,\n \nor is aryl optionally substituted by one or more R\na\n,\n \nor is 5 to 10 membered heteroaryl optionally substituted by one or more R\na\n,\n \nor is —NR\nb\nR\nc\n, wherein R\nb \nis H or C\n1-6\n-alkyl and wherein R\nc \nis H, C\n1-6\n-alkyl or aryl optionally substituted by one or more R\na\n,\n \nwherein R\na \nis selected from:\n        \n \nhalo,\n \ncyano,\n \noxo,\n \nhydroxy,\n \nhalobenzenesulfonyl,\n \nC\n1-6\n-alkyl optionally substituted by one, two or three substitutents selected from the group consisting of:\n            \n \n5 to 10 membered heterocycloalkyl, and\n \naryl which is optionally substituted by halo or by C\n1-6\n-alkoxy,\n \n\n\n \nC\n1-6\n-haloalkyl,\n \nC\n1-6\n-haloalkoxy,\n \nC\n1-6\n-alkoxy optionally substituted by aryl or by 5 to 10 membered heteroaryl each of which is optionally substituted by C\n1-6\n-alkyl,\n \naryloxy,\n \n—NH(CO)—C\n1-6\n-alkyl,\n \n—O(CO)—C\n1-6\n-alkyl,\n \nC\n1-6\n-alkylsulfonyl,\n \naryl,\n \n4 to 10 membered heterocycloalkyl optionally substituted by hydroxy, C\n1-6\n-alkyl or oxo,\n \n5 to 10 membered heteroaryl optionally substituted by C\n1-6\n-alkyl or oxo, and\n \ndi(C\n1-6\n)alkylamino; and\n \n\n\n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis H, OH, C\n1-6\n-alkyl or halo;\n\n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n \n\n\nThe invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention and processes for the preparation of such compounds and compositions.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) according to the invention are dual modulators of the serotonin 5-HT\n2a \nand dopamine D\n3 \nreceptors.

can be carried out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. Syntheses of the invention are shown in the following schemes. The skills required for carrying out the reaction and purification of the resulting products are known to those skilled in the art. The substitutents and indices used in the following description of the processes have the significance given herein before unless indicated to the contrary.\n\n\nIn more detail, the compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to a person skilled in the art. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references cited in the description or in the examples, or by methods known in the art.\n\n\nIn the following schemes, A, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare as described hereinabove.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeteroaryl or benzoyl-piperidin-1-yl trans-ethyl-cyclohexyl-amides or trans-1,4-cyclohexyl ethyl derivates of formula (Ia) can be prepared as depicted in scheme 1 starting from 4-nitro-phenylacetic acid that was hydrogenated using raney nickel as catalyst. The hydrogenation with nickel leads preferentially to the desired trans-isomer (according to Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1998, 41, 760-771). Preparing the ethyl ester according to methods known to those skilled in the art and described in the mentioned literature (e.g. by treatment with ethanol on the presence of an acid such as HCl) and crystallizing the HCl salt resolves the cis/trans mixture and results in the isolation of the pure trans amino ester chloride B. Reaction with a protecting group such as tert-butyl dicarbonate on the presence of a base like triethylamine and a catalyst like dimethylaminopyridine and reduction with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) in an appropriate solvent such as, e.g. toluene at −78° C. gives the aldehyde C which can be used without purification on the next step. Reductive amination of aldehyde C with a substituted phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D either commercially available or accessible by methods described in references by methods described in this patent or by methods known in the art in the presence of a solvent like dichloromethane or 1,2-dichlorethane and a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxy borohydride yields intermediate E. Removal of the Boc protective group under acidic conditions such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent such as, e.g. THF, EtOAc or dichlormethane yields the trans-amino cyclohexyl ethyl intermediate F (usually the TFA or hydrochloride salt). The coupling of the amine intermediate F with carboxylic acids (either commercially available or accessible by methods described in references or by methods known in the art) is widely described in literature (e.g. Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations, 2nd Edition, Richard C. Larock. John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y. 1999) and can be accomplished by employing the usage of coupling reagents such as, e.g. N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in a suitable solvent like, e.g. dimethylformamide (DMF) or dioxane in the presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) to yield compounds of formula (Ia). In other cases an acid chloride can also be used in the presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) in a solvent like dichloromethane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other examples the intermediate F can also react with an isocyanate (when R\nc\n═H) or a reactive intermediate (R\nc\n≠H) such as an appropriate commercial available acid chloride or a para nitro carbamate prepared by methods known in the art or using triphosgene in the presence of a suitable solvent like, e.g. acetonitrile or dichloromethane and of a base (e.g. triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) to obtain a compound of the formula (Ia) as described on the scheme 2 above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases the phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D can be coupled in a reductive amination step with a more elaborated aldehyde I according to scheme 3. We used in some cases the quinoline-4-carboxylic acid [4-(2-oxo-ethyl)-cyclohexyl]-amide. The preparation of quinoline-4-carboxylic acid [4-(2-oxo-ethyl)-cyclohexyl]-amide I is described on scheme 2 starting from 4-nitro-phenylacetic acid A that was hydrogenated as already described on scheme 1 using raney nickel and preparing the trans-amino ethyl ester chloride B as already also described on scheme 1. In this case instead of performing the reaction with a protecting group installing reagent such as tert-butyl dicarbonate the amine or amine hydrochloride can reacted with quinoline-4-carbonyl chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in solvent such as dichloromethane to obtain trans-{4-[(quinoline-4-carbonyl)-amino]-cyclohexyl}-acetic acid ethyl ester. Hydrolysis of the ester function under acid or basic conditions such as lithium hydroxide in a solvent mixture such as THF:water gives the corresponding acid G. The preparation of acid intermediates in order to make reductions is known in literature (e.g. T. Fukuyama et. al., Synthesis 2000, 8, 1121-1123). In this case reaction of the acid with sodium ethylthiolate prepared previously from ethanothiol and a base such as butyllithium in a solvent such as dimethoxyethane yields trans-{4-[(quinoline-4-carbonyl)-amino]-cyclohexyl}-thioacetic acid S-ethyl ester (H) that can be reduced with palladium on charcoal and triethylsilane in a solvent like acetone/methylenechloride (1:1) mixture to obtain the desired trans-quinoline-4-carboxylic acid [4-(2-oxo-ethyl)-cyclohexyl]-amide (I) that can be used in a reductive amination using a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxy borohydride in a solvent such as dichloromethane to obtain directly trans-quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (4-{2-[4-(4-fluoro-benzoyl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-cyclohexyl)-amide (Ia).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the general formula (Ic) wherein R\n1 \nis NR\nb\nR\nc \nor different from NR\nb\nR\nc \ncan also be prepared according to scheme 4. In this case the intermediate N used on the reductive amination with the phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone is prepared starting from ethyl 2-formyl-1-cyclopropanecarboxylate (88-90% trans isomer) that can react in a reductive BOC amination (known in literature e.g. Tetrahedron Letters 42 (2001), 5093-5094) through the formation of an α-amidoalkyl sulfone K using tert butyl carbamate and anhydrous sodium p-toluensulfinate in solvents like methanol and water. The α-amidoalkyl sulfone K is crystallized in a solvent like n-heptane to obtain only the trans isomer. Reaction of the α-amidoalkyl sulfone intermediate K with sodium borohydride in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran produces the trans-2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino-methyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester L through the formation of an imine as intermediate. Reduction of the ethyl ester M with a reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) in an appropriate solvent such as, e.g. toluene at −78° C. gives the aldehyde M which can be used without purification on the next step. Reductive amination of the aldehyde with a substituted phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D in the presence of a solvent like 1,2-dichloromethane and a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxy borohydride yields intermediate N. Removal of the Boc protective group under acidic conditions such as trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent such as, e.g. THF yields an intermediate (usually as a salt) that as in scheme 1 can be coupled with carboxylic acids using a coupling agent such as O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in a suitable solvent like, e.g. dimethylformamide (DMF) or dioxane in the presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) yielding compounds of formula (Ic) wherein R\n1 \nis not NR\nb\nR\nc\n. In the cases where R\n1 \nis NR\nb\nR\nc \nthe intermediate mentioned above could react with an isocyanate yielding the corresponding compounds of formula (Ic).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the general formula (Ib) wherein R\n1 \nis NR\nb\nR\nc \nand (Ib) wherein R\n1 \nis not NR\nb\nR\nc \nand wherein can be also prepared according to scheme 5 through an alkylation step with an adequate good leaving group installed on the coupling partner. This coupling partner T (methanesulfonic acid trans-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino-methyl)cyclobutylmethyl ester) can be obtained from the commercial available trans-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester O that is reduced to the trans-2-hydroxymethyl-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid methyl ester P with the use of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in a solvent like methanol. Oxidation of the alcohol functionality according to methods known to those skilled in the art and described in literature (e.g. under Swern conditions using oxalyl chloride, dimethylsulfoxide and triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane) yields intermediate Q that follows the same step of reductive BOC amination through the formation of an α-amidoalkyl sulfone intermediate already described on scheme 4. Reduction of the ethyl ester S to the alcohol T with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride and conversion of the alcohol into a good leaving group (e.g. conversion to a mesylate T by reaction with methanosulphonyl chloride in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine and in a solvent like dichloromethane) that reacts in an alkylation step with a substituted phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D in presence of a base (e.g. N,N-diisopropylethylamine) under refluxing conditions gives intermediates of structure N. The last two steps (removal of the Boc protecting group and amide or urea formation) are the same that the ones already described for schemes 1, 2 and 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D intermediates where R\n2 \nsignifies OH can be prepared according to scheme 6 and following a process also partially described in literature (e.g. patent DE 25365103). Introduction of a benzyl group using benzyl bromide in the presence of a base like triethylamine with or without a catalyst such as sodium iodide in a solvent like acetonitrile using a temperature such as 80° C. gave intermediate W. Introduction of bromide in alpha position to the ketone of (1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-methanone can be accomplish using bromine under reflux. Treatment of the alpha bromo ketone X with sodium methanolate gave 6-benzyl-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-methoxy-1-oxa-6-aza-spiro[2.5]octane (Y) that can be hydrolyzed in a solvent like ether under chloridic acid treatment to yield (1-benzyl-4-hydroxy-piperidin-4-yl)-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-methanone (Z). Removal of the benzyl group can be performed under hydrogenation conditions using palladium as catalyst in a solvent like ethyl acetate and methanol to obtain the desired (1-benzyl-4-hydroxy-piperidin-4-yl)-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-methanone (intermediate D). On the last hydrogenation step the reduction of the ketone can also be observed and the diol compound can be formed as a side product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D intermediates where R\n2 \nsignifies a fluorine atom can be prepared according to scheme 7. The phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone might be protected first with a suitable protective group such as a tert-butoxycarbonyl group which, after introduction of the fluorine atom, can be removed under conditions known to those skilled in the art (e.g. treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane). The introduction of fluor can be performed by deprotonation of the corresponding carbon in alpha position to the ketone by treatment with a base in a suitable solvent under anhydrous conditions (e.g. potassium ter-butoxide/t-butanol in DMF) in the presence of a fluorinating agent such as N-fluorobenzenesulphonimide at a temperature from 0° C. to room temperature to obtain after the three steps the aryl-(4-fluoro-piperidin-4-yl)-methanone or heteroaryl-(4-fluoro-piperidin-4-yl)-methanone D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone D intermediates where R\n2 \nsignifies a methyl or other C\n1-6\n-alkyl groups can be prepared according to scheme 8 with a carbon-carbon coupling reaction where a Pd complex catalyzes the acylation of boronic acids with carboxylic anhydrides obtained in situ using pivalic anhydride that reacts with the corresponding N-Boc-4-methyl-4-piperidinecarboxylic acid and using the corresponding phenyl boronic acid. The tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group can be removed under conditions known those skilled in the art (e.g. treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane) to obtain after the three steps the aryl-(4-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-methanone D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the general formula (Id) wherein R\n1 \nis NR\nb\nR\nc \nand compounds of formula (Id) wherein R\n1 \nis not NR\nb\nR\nc \ncan be prepared according to scheme 9 with a compound D phenyl or heteroaryl piperidin-4-yl-methanone that can be alkylated with 4-(Boc-amino)butyl bromide with the use of a base (e.g. N,N-diisopropyl ethyl amine) in an appropriate solvent like acetonitrile under refluxing conditions. After removal of the amine protecting group (in our case the Boc group) using acidic conditions (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane) and as already described, the amine intermediate can be coupled with carboxylic acids using a coupling agent such as O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in a suitable solvent like, e.g. dimethylformamide (DMF) in presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) yielding compounds of formula (Id) wherein R\n1 \nis not NR\nb\nR\nc \nor in other cases with an isocyanate yielding the corresponding compounds of formula (Id) wherein R\n1 \nis NR\nb\nR\nc\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcetic acid amide derivatives of structure AH can be conveniently prepared according to scheme 10 starting from compound B. The reaction sequence involves in a first step the treatment of compound B with AcCl in presence of a base such as Et\n3\nN in a solvent such as CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nto obtain a compound of formula AE. Reduction with a reagent such as LiAlH\n4 \nin a solvent such as CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nat 0° C. provides a compound of formula AF. Among several oxidation conditions known in the literature, the Swern oxidation (A. Mancuso, D. Swern, \nSynthesis \n1981, 165-185) of alcohol AF provides intermediate AG. Reaction of aldehyde AG with an appropriate substituted piperidine in the presence of a reducing agent such as Na(AcO)\n3\nBH in a solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane provides compounds of formula AH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of formula Ia where A is a substituted or unsubstituted thiophenyl group can be prepared as described in Scheme 1 using a piperidin-4-yl-thiophen-2-yl-methanone of formula AL as intermediate D. The preparation of intermediates of formula AL is depicted in Scheme 11. A thiophene of formula A1 can be deprotonated with a base such as n-BuLi in a solvent such as THF and reacted with 4-formyl-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester to obtain an alcohol of formula AJ. Oxidation of an alcohol of formula AJ with reagents such as for example TPAP/NMO or MnO\n2 \nin a solvent such as CH\n2\nCl\n2 \naffords a ketone of formula AK. Treatment of a compound of formula AK with an acid such as HCl affords a compound of formula AL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA compound of structure AL (Scheme 11) where R equals 5-fluoro can be prepared according to scheme 12. This method consists in the subsequent double deprotonation of thiophene with a base such as n-BuLi in a solvent such as THF and reaction with a fluorinating agent such as N-fluorodibenzenesulfonimide after the first deprotonation step and 4-formyl-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester after the second, to obtain an alcohol of formula AM.\n\n\nThe ability of the compounds to bind to the 5-HT\n2A\n, D\n3 \nand D\n2 \nreceptors was determined using radioligand binding to cloned receptors selectively expressed in HEK-293 EBNA cells.\n\n\nMembrane Preparation for Human D\n2\n, Human D\n3 \nand Human 5-HT\n2A \nReceptors\n\n\nHEK-293 EBNA cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding for the human D\n2 \nor D\n3 \ndopamine- or for the human 5-HT\n2A \nserotonin receptor, respectively. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, washed three times with cold PBS and stored at −80° C. prior to use. The pellet was suspended in cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Basel, Switzerland) for 20-30 sec at 12.000 rpm. After centrifugation at 48.000×g for 30 min at 4° C., the pellet was resuspended in cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), homogenized, and centrifuged as above. This pellet was further resuspended in a smaller volume of ice cold 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron for 20-30 sec at 12.000 rpm. The protein content of this homogenate was determined with the Bio-Rad (Bradford) Protein Assay (Biorad Laboratories GmbH, München, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer using gamma globulin as the standard. This homogenate was stored at −80° C. in aliquots and thawed immediately prior to use.\n\n\nRadioligand Binding Assay Conditions\n\n\nAliquots of membrane preparations were thawed at RT, resupended in assay buffer (D\n2\n, D\n3\n: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH=7.4; 5-HT\n2A\n: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA, pH=7.4), homogenized with a Polytron for 20-30 sec at 12.000 rpm and adjusted to a final concentration of approximately 7.5 μg protein/well (D\n2\n, D\n3\n) and 15 μg protein/well (5-HT\n2A\n), respectively.\n\n\nThe binding affinity (Ki) of the compounds was determined using radioligand binding. Membranes were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl with a fixed concentration of radioligand (final concentration approximately 0.7 nM [\n3\nH]-spiperone for D\n2\n, 0.5 nM [\n3\nH]-spiperone for D\n3\n, and 1.1 nM [\n3\nH]-ketanserin for 5-HT\n2A\n) and ten concentrations of test compound in ranging between 10 μM-0.1 nM for 1 h at RT. At the end of the incubation, the reaction mixtures were filtered on to unifilter 96-well white microplates with bonded GF/C filters (Packard BioScience, Zürich, Switzerland; preincubated for 1 h in 0.1% polyethylenimine (PEI) in assay buffer) with a Filtermate 196 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold assay buffer. The nonspecific binding was determined with equally composed reaction mixtures in the presence of 10 μM unlabelled spiperone. Per well 45 μl of Microscint 40 (Perkin Elmer, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) was added, plates for sealed, shaken for 20 min and counted for 3 min on a Topcount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Canberra Packard SA, Zürich, Switzerland) with quenching correction.\n\n\nData Calculation\n\n\nThe CPM value for each duplicate of a concentration of competing compound was averaged (y1), then the % specific binding was calculated according to the equation (((y1−non-specific)/(total binding-non-specific))×100). Graphs were plotted with the % specific binding using XLfit, a curve fitting program that iteratively plots the data using Levenburg Marquardt algorithm. The single site competition analysis equation used was y=A+((B−A)/(+((x/C)\nD\n))), where y is the % specific binding, A is the minimum y, B is the maximum y, C is the IC\n50\n, x is the log\n10 \nof the concentration of the competing compound and D is the slope of the curve (the Hill Coefficient). From these curves the IC\n50 \n(inhibition concentration at which 50% specific binding of the radioligand was displaced) and Hill coefficient were determined. The affinity constant (Ki) was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation KI =(IC\n50\n/1+([L]/Kd), where [L] is the concentration of radioligand and Kd is the dissociation constant of the radioligand at the receptor as determined by the saturation isotherm.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are selective dual modulators of the serotonin 5-HT\n2a \nand dopamine D\n3 \nreceptors as this is shown with the activity table hereinafter which gives the Ki values in nM for the serotonin 5-HT\n2a\n, dopamine D\n3 \nand dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors for some examples of the compounds of the present invention:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nACTIVITY TABLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n20\n\n\n22\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n6/2/106\n\n\n18/5/586\n\n\n15/4/149\n\n\n72/5/73\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n33\n\n\n25\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n32/8/450\n\n\n110/65/1977\n\n\n13/269/777\n\n\n4/11/677\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n50\n\n\n57\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n15/2/30\n\n\n29/2/288\n\n\n53/21/1334\n\n\n19/80/3542\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n64\n\n\n70\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n35/64/2895\n\n\n4/26/3998\n\n\n97/22/2714\n\n\n39/26/2133\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n26\n\n\n29\n\n\n30A25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n144/12/96\n\n\n17/14/684\n\n\n37/8/450\n\n\n26/5/1285\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30A27\n\n\n30A28\n\n\n30A29\n\n\n30A36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n8/8/1117\n\n\n9/5/470\n\n\n207/25/1008\n\n\n26/5/1285\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30A37\n\n\n30A58\n\n\n30A59\n\n\n30A64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n29/11/2002\n\n\n30/15/2070\n\n\n19/5/888\n\n\n19/13/625\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n39\n\n\n40\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n23/6/192\n\n\n2/3/1844\n\n\n8/9/502\n\n\n146/11/352\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42A7\n\n\n63A14\n\n\n65A11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKi(nM)\n\n\n86/26/176\n\n\n44/83/8539\n\n\n71/38/1447\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD\n3\n/5HT\n2A\n/D\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention, for example compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically suitable acid addition salts, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical compositions also can be in the form of suppositories or injectable solutions.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compounds of the invention, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include pharmaceutically inert, inorganic and organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such as carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical compositions can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a method for preparing compositions of the invention which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nThe dosage at which compounds of the invention can be administered can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, the following examples have been performed, regardless of the tense in which they are written.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n4-Chloro-N-trans-(4-{2-[4-(4-fluoro-benzoyl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-cyclohexyl)-benzamide\n\n\nIntermediate B\n\n\nTrans-(4-Amino-cyclohexyl)-acetic acid ethyl ester\n\n\nStep 1.\n\n\n(4-Nitro-phenyl)-acetic acid (50 g, 276 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 22.08 g of 50% sodium hydroxide solution in 450 mL deionizated water. The clear yellow solution was transferred into a high-pressure autoclave that it charged with 30 g (511 mmol) of water-wet sponge nickel catalyst. The autoclave was sealed, flushed with nitrogen and then pressurized to 115 bar with hydrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 125° C. for 48 h. At that time the autoclave was cooled, vented and charged under nitrogen with another 30 g (511 mmol) of the sponge nickel catalyst. The autoclave was flushed again with nitrogen and then pressurized to 115 bar and the vessel was heated to 130° C. while stirring (a maximum pressure of 130 bars was observed). Hydrogenation was continued for 5 days to 130° C. The autoclave was then cooled, vented and flushed with nitrogen and the contents were removed and filtered through filter aid to remove catalyst. After removal of the solvent 74 g of crude material was obtained. The intermediated was used directly in the next step without purification. MS (m/e): 158.3 (M+H\n+\n)\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\nA solution of the Trans-(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-acetic acid obtained (74 g, 476 mmol) was adjusted to pH 5 with 25% HCl. The mixture was evaporated to dryness and dried under vacuum overnight. The residue was suspended in 146 mL of a 6.5N ethanolic HCl solution and 0.6 L of ethanol was added to the mixture. After 4 h refluxing, the mixture was cooled and filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in ethanol, treated with ether and cooled overnight in the refrigerator to give the Trans-(4-Amino-cyclohexyl)-acetic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride (19.7 g, 32% on the two steps) as a white solid which was filtered and dried under vacuum. MS (m/e): 186.1 (M+H\n+\n)\n\n\nIntermediate C\n\n\nStep 1\n\n\nTrans-(4-tert-Butoxycarbonylamino-cyclohexyl)-acetic acid ethyl ester\n\n\nTo a solution of Trans-(4-Amino-cyclohexyl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (1.28 g, 7 mmol), in dichloromethane (15 mL), di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (2.26 g, 10 mmol), triethylamine (0.699 mL, 7 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.042 mL, 0.35 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred for 8 h until TLC indicated completion of the reaction. Water was added and the solution was extracted three times with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash-chromatography on silica gel with hexane:ethyl acetate (4:2 to 3:2) to give 1.2 g (60%) of the product as a white solid. MS (m/e): 284.4 (M−H\n+\n).\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\nTrans-[4-(2-Oxo-ethyl)-cyclohexyl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester\n\n\nTo a solution of trans-(4-tert-Butoxycarbonylamino-cyclohexyl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (1.04 g, 4 mmol), in toluene (10 mL) at −78° C. a 1.2M solution of DIBAL-H (5.1 mL, 6 mmol) in toluene was added. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. until TLC after 0.5 h indicated completion of the reaction. Water was added and the solution was extracted three times with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. The crude product was used without purification on the next step. MS (m/e): 242.3 (M+H\n+\n).\n\n\nIntermediate E\n\n\nTrans-(4-{2-[4-(4-Fluoro-benzoyl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester\n\n\nA mixture of 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (0.850 g, 3.4 mmol), Trans-[4-(2-Oxo-ethyl)-cyclohexyl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (0.926 g, 4 mmol), in 1, 2 dichloroethane (10 mL) was stirred for 4 h at room temperature and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.33 g, 6 mmol) was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 12 hours until the TLC indicated completion of the reaction. The mixture was filtrated and concentrated to dryness and purified with column chromatography on silica gel using CH\n2\nCl\n2\n—CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/MeOH (1-9:1). The product fractions were concentrated to give 1.4 g (3.25 mmol, 93.2% yield) of a light yellow solid.

(1.98 mL, 26 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. NaHCO\n3 \nwas slowly added until pH 9 and the mixture extracted with 3 times with dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated to yield 0.812 g (24.4 mmol, 75.5%) of a white solid that was used without purification on the next steps.

The mixture was stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. The mixture was concentrated to dryness and the residue was taken up on methanol and purified with preparative HPLC on reversed phase eluting with acetonitrile/water. The combined producted fractions were evaporated under reduced pressure to yield 0.015 g of a off-white solid (0.032 mmol, 36%). MS (m/e): 471.3 (M+H\n+\n).\n\n\nAccording to the procedure described for the synthesis of example 1 further derivatives have been synthesized from the respective Trans-{1-[2-(4-Amino-cyclohexyl)-ethyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-methanone and the corresponding acid.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims priority to the following: U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/073,269 filed on Jun. 17, 2008, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/078,168 filed Jul. 3, 2008, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/090,412 filed on Aug. 20, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/177,476 filed on May 12, 2009. The disclosure of each application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nPre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-1 is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to \namino acids\n 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon. GLP-1(7-36) amide or GLP-1(7-37) acid are biologically potent forms of GLP-1, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels drops too low to provide enough energy for the body's activities. In adults or children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment, but it can result from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors. When blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise toward a normal level. Thus, glucagon's most recognized role in glucose regulation is to counteract the action of insulin and maintain blood glucose levels. However for diabetics, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia may be impaired, making it harder for glucose levels to return to the normal range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypoglycemia is a life threatening event that requires immediate medical attention. The administration of glucagon is an established medication for treating acute hypoglycemia and it can restore normal levels of glucose within minutes of administration. When glucagon is used in the acute medical treatment of hypoglycemia, a crystalline form of glucagon is solubilized with a dilute acid buffer and the solution is injected intramuscularly. While this treatment is effective, the methodology is cumbersome and dangerous for someone that is semi-conscious. Accordingly, there is a need for a glucagon analog that maintains or exceeds the biological performance of the parent molecule but is sufficiently soluble and stable, under relevant physiological conditions, that it can be pre-formulated as a solution, ready for injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, diabetics are encouraged to maintain near normal blood glucose levels to delay or prevent microvascular complications. Achievement of this goal usually requires intensive insulin therapy. In striving to achieve this goal, physicians have encountered a substantial increase in the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia in their diabetic patients. Accordingly, improved pharmaceuticals and methodologies are needed for treating diabetes that are less likely to induce hypoglycemia than current insulin therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 has different biological activities compared to glucagon. Its actions include stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GLP-1 has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia (elevated glucose levels) in diabetics. Exendin-4, a peptide from lizard venom that shares about 50% amino acid identity with GLP-1, activates the GLP-1 receptor and likewise has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is also evidence that GLP-1 and exendin-4 may reduce food intake and promote weight loss, an effect that would be beneficial not only for diabetics but also for patients suffering from obesity. Patients with obesity have a higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there remains a need for alternative and preferably improved methods for treating diabetes and obesity.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described herein, high potency glucagon agonists analogs are provided that also exhibit increased activity at the glucagon receptor, and in further embodiments exhibit enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility. In addition, in accordance with another aspect of the invention, glucagon agonist analogs are provided that have lost native glucagon's selectivity for the glucagon receptor verses the GLP-1 receptor, and thus represent co-agonists of those two receptors. Selected amino acid modifications within the glucagon analogs can control the relative activity of the analog at the GLP-1 receptor verses the glucagon receptor. Thus, yet another aspect of the invention provides glucagon co-agonist analogs that have higher activity at the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor, glucagon co-agonist analogs that have approximately equivalent activity at both receptors, and glucagon co-agonist analogs that have higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor versus the glucagon receptor. The latter category of co-agonist can be engineered to exhibit little or no activity at the glucagon receptor, and yet retain ability to activate the GLP-1 receptor with the same or better potency than native GLP-1. Any of these analogs may also include modifications that confer enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon analogs that demonstrate co-agonism at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors are advantageous for several applications. First of all the use of glucagon to treat hypoglycemia may overcompensate for low blood glucose levels and result in excess blood glucose levels. If a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is administered, the additional GLP-1 stimulation may buffer the glucagon agonist effect to prevent excessive glucose blood levels resulting from treatment of hypoglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition as described herein, glucagon co-agonist analogs of the invention may be used to control hyperglycemia, or to induce weight loss or prevent weight gain, when administered alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity treatments. Another compound that induces weight loss is oxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA). While the present invention contemplates that glucagon analogs described herein may optionally be joined to this 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 27), the invention in some embodiments also specifically contemplates analogs and uses of analogs lacking the 8 contiguous carboxy amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can be customized by amino acid modifications to regulate the GLP-1 activity of the peptide, and thus the glucagon analogs of the present can be tailored to treat a particular condition or disease. More particularly, glucagon analogs are provided herein wherein each analog displays a characteristic relative level of activity at the respective glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. For example, modifications can be made to each peptide to produce a glucagon peptide having anywhere from at least about 1% (including at least about 1.5%, 2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%) to about 200% or higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1 and anywhere from at least about 1% (including about 1.5%, 2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%) to about 500% or higher activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. The amino acid sequence of native glucagon is SEQ ID NO: 1, the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-36)amide is SEQ ID NO: 52, and the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-37) acid is SEQ ID NO: 50. In exemplary embodiments, a glucagon peptide may exhibit at least 10% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 50% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, or at least 40% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 40% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, or at least 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 60% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelectivity of a glucagon peptide for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor can be described as the relative ratio of glucagon/GLP-1 activity (the peptide's activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon, divided by the peptide's activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1). For example, a glucagon peptide that exhibits 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and 60% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor has a 1:1 ratio of glucagon/GLP-1 activity. Exemplary ratios of glucagon/GLP-1 activity include about 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1 or 10:1, or about 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, or 1:1.5. As an example, a glucagon/GLP-1 activity ratio of 10:1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor. Similarly, a GLP-1/glucagon activity ratio of 10:1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the GLP-1 receptor versus the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, analogs of glucagon are provided that have enhanced potency and optionally improved solubility and stability. In one embodiment, enhanced glucagon potency is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at \nposition\n 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In one embodiment the enhanced potency glucagon agonist comprises a peptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 5. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog protein having enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor relative to wild type glucagon is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, wherein the glucagon peptide retains its selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced, maintained, or enhanced by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3. In one embodiment, substitution of the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 with an acidic, basic, or hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) has been shown to substantially reduce or destroy glucagon receptor activity. The analogs that are substituted with, for example, glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine have about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, e.g. about 1-10%, or about 0.1-10%, or greater than about 0.1% but less than about 10%, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, exemplary analogs described herein have about 0.5%, about 1% or about 7% of the activity of native glucagon, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3 of the glucagon peptide can be substituted with a glutamine analog without a substantial loss of activity at the glucagon receptor, and in some cases, with an enhancement of glucagon receptor activity. For example, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 601 or SEQ ID NO: 602) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3. In some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis C\n0-3 \nalkyl or C\n0-3 \nheteroalkyl; R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n3 \nis C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n4 \nis H or C\n1-3 \nalkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n. In some embodiments, X is NH or Y is NHR\n4\n. In some embodiments, R\n1 \nis C\n0-2 \nalkyl or C\n1 \nheteroalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1 \nalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n4 \nis H or C\n1 \nalkyl. In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—S, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetamidomethyl-cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1 \nis C\n0 \nalkyl, X is NH, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetylornithine, Orn(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure II is provide where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis CH\n3 \n(methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure III is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2 \nand R\n4 \nis H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac) For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 595, SEQ ID NO: 601 SEQ ID NO: 603, SEQ ID NO: 604, SEQ ID NO: 605, and SEQ ID NO: 606.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment analogs of glucagon are provided that have enhanced or retained potency at the glucagon receptor relative to the native glucagon peptide, but also have greatly enhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor. Glucagon normally has about 1% of the activity of native-GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, while GLP-1 normally has less than about 0.01% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. Enhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. In one embodiment, these glucagon analogs comprise a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group found on the native amino acid. These glucagon analogs have strong activity at both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors and thus act as co-agonists at both receptors. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon and GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the amino acid at position 28 is Asn or Lys and the amino acid at position 29 is Thr-amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), through formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “i” and an amino acid at position “i+4”, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25, by two intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “j” and an amino acid at position “j+3,” wherein j is any integer between 12 and 27, or by six intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “k” and an amino acid at position “k+7,” wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length and forms between side chains of amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 12 and 16, or at \n \npositions\n \n 16 and 20, or at \n \npositions\n \n 20 and 24, or at \npositions\n 24 and 28. The side chains of these amino acids can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein a lactam ring is formed between the side chains of a lysine residue, located at \n \nposition\n \n 12, 20 or 28, and a glutamic acid residue, located at \n \nposition\n \n 16 or 24, wherein the two amino acids of the glucagon peptide whose side chains participate in forming the lactam ring are spaced from one another by three intervening amino acids. In accordance with one embodiment the lactam bearing glucagon analog comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 18. In one embodiment the carboxy terminal amino acid of the lactam bearing peptide comprises an amide group or an ester group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid. In one embodiment a glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, and SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 18 further comprises an additional amino acid covalently bound to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 or SEQ ID NO: 18. In a further embodiment a glucagon peptide is provided comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68 and SEQ ID NO: 69 further comprises an additional amino acid covalently bound to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68 and SEQ ID NO: 69. In one embodiment the amino acid at position 28 is asparagine or lysine and the amino acid at position 29 is threonine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon agonist peptide is achieved through the formation of a covalent intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods (i.e., means of forming a covalent intramolecular bridge) include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of a, co-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) through introduction of one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished in this manner without purposeful introduction of an intramolecular bridge such as a salt bridge or covalent bond. Such peptides may be considered herein as a peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge. In specific aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished by introducing one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids without introduction of a covalent intramolecular bridge, e.g., a lactam bridge, a disulfide bridge. Such peptides may be considered herein as a peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of \nposition\n 16 of the glucagon peptide with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) enhances GLP-1 activity, in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors for glucagon analog peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) is provided by the addition of an acyl or alkyl group to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the peptide. In some aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is not naturally-occurring on an amino acid. In specific aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to any naturally-occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acyl group, e.g., a C4 to C30 fatty acyl group. For example, provided herein is a glucagon analog peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge comprising AIB at \nposition\n 16 and a C14, C16, or C18 fatty acyl group covalently attached to a Lys residue at \nposition\n 10. Also provided is a glucagon analog peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) comprising AIB at \n \npositions\n \n 2 and 16 and a C14, C16, or C18 fatty acyl group covalently attached to a Lys residue at \nposition\n 10. Such acylated glucagon analog peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) may be pegylated as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further enhancement in GLP-1 activity and glucagon activity for acylated glucagon analog peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., an intramolecular bridge) may be achieved by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10. In accordance with some embodiments, the spacer (e.g., an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer) is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length. In accordance with certain specific embodiments, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is 14 to 28 atoms, e.g., 17 to 28, 19 to 26 atoms, 19 to 21 atoms. Suitable spacers for purposes of enhancing GLP-1 activity and glucagon activity for acylated or alkylated peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, provided herein is a non-native glucagon peptide that differs from SEQ ID NO: 1 by no more than 10 amino acid modifications, comprising an acyl group or alkyl group, wherein the acyl or alkyl group is attached to a spacer and the spacer is attached to the side chain of an amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide, wherein, when said glucagon peptide lacks a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, said glucagon peptide exhibits at least 20% (e.g., at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90% at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, about 100%, about 150%, about 200%, about 400%, about 500% or more) of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide exhibits at least 0.5% (e.g., at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%) of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, when the glucagon peptide lacks a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described above may exhibit any of the above indicated activities and no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described above may exhibit any of the above indicated activities and no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20. In one embodiment, the glutamine at \nposition\n 20 is replaced with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity and which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity may provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the invention provides glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at \nposition\n 16, at \nposition\n 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 16 and 20; glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at \nposition\n 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at \n \npositions\n \n 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 16 and 20; and glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at \nposition\n 20 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at \nposition\n 12 is not Arg; or optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at \nposition\n 9 is not Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2, as described herein, can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage. For example, the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 may be substituted with D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, or amino isobutyric acid. Alternatively, or in addition, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 may be substituted with D-histidine, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine, homo-histidine, N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, or alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at \nposition\n 1 may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon, e.g. through a covalent bond between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, e.g., 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at \nposition\n 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides with GLP-1 activity that contain a non-conservative substitution of His at \nposition\n 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr) can retain GLP-1 activity provided that the alpha-helix is stabilized via an intramolecular bridge, e.g. through a covalent bond between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, e.g., 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at \nposition\n 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing compounds can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 of SEQ ID NO: 1 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are enhanced by the covalent linkage of a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, optionally linked to the peptide at one or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the C-terminal amino acid. In one embodiment the peptide co-agonist comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19 wherein the side chain of an amino acid residue at one of \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 16, 17, 21 or 24 of said glucagon peptide further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain, having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of any of the preceding glucagon analogs can be improved by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 27. In accordance with one embodiment the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with a charged amino acids, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. Additional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain glucagon activity. In one embodiment an analog of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20 is provided wherein the analog differs from SEQ ID NO: 20 by 1 to 2 amino acid substitutions at positions 17-26, and in one embodiment the analog differs from the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20 by an amino acid substitution at \nposition\n 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified by truncation of the C-terminus by one or two amino acid residues. Such modified glucagon peptides, as shown herein, retain similar activity and potency at the glucagon receptor and GLP-1 receptor. In this regard, the glucagon peptides can comprise amino acids 1-27 or 1-28 of the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1), optionally with any of the additional modifications described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified by the addition of a second peptide to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide, for example, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 or SEQ ID NO: 28. In one embodiment a glucagon peptide having a peptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68, and SEQ ID NO: 69 is covalently bound through a peptide bond to a second peptide, wherein the second peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 and SEQ ID NO: 28. In a further embodiment, in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at position 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. A glucagon analog having a glycine substitution for threonine at position 29 and comprising the carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26 is four times as potent at the GLP-1 receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. Potency at the GLP-1 receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein can be modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group, e.g., a C4 to C30 acyl or alkyl group. In some aspects, the acyl group or alkyl group is non-native to any naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV. As shown herein, the activity at the glucagon receptor and GLP-1 receptor of the glucagon peptide is maintained, if not substantially enhanced, after acylation. Further, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides were comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides, if not substantially enhanced. Glucagon peptides may be acylated or alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. In some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, Glu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as disclosed herein high potency glucagon analogs or glucagon co-agonist analogs are provided that also exhibit improved solubility and/or stability. An exemplary high potency glucagon analog exhibits at least about 200% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, and optionally is soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25.C. As another example, an exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits greater than about 40% or greater than about 60% activity at both the glucagon and the GLP-1 receptors (at a ratio between about 1:3 and 3:1, or between about 1:2 and 2:1), is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6′ and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Another exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits about 175% or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and about 20% or less of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Yet another exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 20% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Yet another exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits about 10% or less but above 0.1%, 0.5% or 1% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% or more of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25.C. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. In some embodiments, such glucagon analogs retain at least 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or 28 of the naturally occurring amino acids at the corresponding positions in native glucagon (e.g. have 1-7, 1-5 or 1-3 modifications relative to naturally occurring glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny one of the following peptides is excluded from the compounds of the invention, although any of the following peptides comprising one or more further modifications thereto as described herein exhibiting the desired GLP-1 or co-agonist activity, pharmaceutical compositions, kits, and treatment methods using such compounds may be included in the invention: The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with an [Arg12] substitution and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Arg12,Lys20] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Arg12,Lys24] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Arg12,Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with a [Glu9] substitution; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing His1, with [Glu9, Glu16, Lys29] substitutions and C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Glu9, Glu16, Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lys13, Glu17] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lys17, Glu21] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing His1, with [Glu20, Lys24] substitutions linked via lactam bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising any of the novel glucagon peptides disclosed herein, preferably sterile and preferably at a purity level of at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient.

In some embodiments, the compositions may contain a glucagon peptide at a concentration range of A to B mg/ml, for example, 0.001 to 30.0 mg/ml. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions comprise aqueous solutions that are sterilized and optionally stored within various containers. The compounds of the present invention can be used in accordance with one embodiment to prepare pre-formulated solutions ready for injection. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions comprise a lyophilized powder. The pharmaceutical compositions can be further packaged as part of a kit that includes a disposable device for administering the composition to a patient. The containers or kits may be labeled for storage at ambient room temperature or at refrigerated temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a method of rapidly increasing glucose level or treating hypoglycemia using a pre-formulated aqueous composition of glucagon peptides of the invention is provided. The method comprises the step of administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a novel modified glucagon peptide of the present disclosure. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide is pegylated at \n \nposition\n \n 21 or 24 of the glucagon peptide and the PEG chain has a molecular weight of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the modified glucagon solution is prepackaged in a device that is used to administer the composition to the patient suffering from hypoglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment an improved method of regulating blood glucose levels in insulin dependent patients is provided.

The method comprises the step of administering one or more of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome or Reaven's syndrome, is a disorder that affects over 50 million Americans. Metabolic Syndrome is typically characterized by a clustering of at least three or more of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), (2) atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol that enhance the accumulation of plaque in the artery walls), (3) elevated blood pressure, (4) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, (5) prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in blood), and (6) pro-inflammatory state (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein in blood). Other risk factors may include aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome is associated with an increased the risk of coronary heart disease and other disorders related to the accumulation of vascular plaque, such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease, referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome may progress from an insulin resistant state in its early stages to full blown type II diabetes with further increasing risk of ASCVD. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the relationship between insulin resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and vascular disease may involve one or more concurrent pathogenic mechanisms including impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation, insulin resistance-associated reduction in NO availability due to enhanced oxidative stress, and abnormalities in adipocyte-derived hormones such as adiponectin (Lteif and Mather, Can. J. Cardiol. 20 (suppl. B):66B-76B (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (a waist circumference over 102 cm in men and over 88 cm in women); (b) serum triglycerides (150 mg/dl or above); (c) HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl or lower in men and 50 mg/dl or lower in women); (d) blood pressure (130/85 or more); and (e) fasting blood glucose (110 mg/dl or above). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual having high insulin levels (an elevated fasting blood glucose or an elevated post meal glucose alone) with at least two of the following criteria meets the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (waist to hip ratio of greater than 0.9, a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a waist measurement over 37 inches); (b) cholesterol panel showing a triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl or an HDL cholesterol lower than 35 mg/dl; (c) blood pressure of 140/90 or more, or on treatment for high blood pressure). (Mathur, Ruchi, “Metabolic Syndrome,” ed. Shiel, Jr., William C., MedicineNet.com, May 11, 2009).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes herein, if an individual meets the criteria of either or both of the criteria set forth by the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel or the WHO, that individual is considered as afflicted with Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Metabolic Syndrome, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Metabolic Syndrome, or the risk factor thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (irreversible, advanced scarring of the liver). All of the stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat (fatty infiltration) in the liver cells (hepatocytes). Simple fatty liver is the abnormal accumulation of a certain type of fat, triglyceride, in the liver cells with no inflammation or scarring. In NASH, the fat accumulation is associated with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. The inflammatory cells can destroy the liver cells (hepatocellular necrosis). In the terms “steatohepatitis” and “steatonecrosis”, steato refers to fatty infiltration, hepatitis refers to inflammation in the liver, and necrosis refers to destroyed liver cells. NASH can ultimately lead to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then irreversible, advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis that is caused by NASH is the last and most severe stage in the NAFLD spectrum. (Mendler, Michel, “Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),” ed. Schoenfield, Leslie J., MedicineNet.com, Aug. 29, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlcoholic Liver Disease, or Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, encompasses three pathologically distinct liver diseases related to or caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol: fatty liver (steatosis), chronic or acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis can range from a mild hepatitis, with abnormal laboratory tests being the only indication of disease, to severe liver dysfunction with complications such as jaundice (yellow skin caused by bilirubin retention), hepatic encephalopathy (neurological dysfunction caused by liver failure), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), bleeding esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), abnormal blood clotting and coma. Histologically, alcoholic hepatitis has a characteristic appearance with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammation with neutrophils and sometimes Mallory bodies (abnormal aggregations of cellular intermediate filament proteins). Cirrhosis is characterized anatomically by widespread nodules in the liver combined with fibrosis. (Worman, Howard J., “Alcoholic Liver Disease”, Columbia University Medical Center website).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, including, for example, steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic inflammation, NASH, cirrhosis, or complications thereof. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, in a subject comprising administering to a subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or the stage thereof. Such treatment methods include reduction in one, two, three or more of the following: liver fat content, incidence or progression of cirrhosis, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, signs of inflammation, e.g. abnormal hepatic enzyme levels (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase AST and/or alanine aminotransferase ALT, or LDH), elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum bilirubin, and/or signs of fibrosis, e.g. elevated TGF-beta levels. In preferred embodiments, the glucagon peptides are used treat patients who have progressed beyond simple fatty liver (steatosis) and exhibit signs of inflammation or hepatitis. Such methods may result, for example, in reduction of AST and/or ALT levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment a method of treating hyperglycemia, or a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss is provided, which involves administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a glucagon peptide of the invention. In one embodiment either method comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising a glucagon agonist selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19. In another embodiment, the method comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising a glucagon agonist, wherein the glucagon agonist comprising a glucagon peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68, and SEQ ID NO: 69, wherein amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide is bound to a second peptide through a peptide bond, and said second peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 or SEQ ID NO: 28. In further embodiments, methods of treating diabetes involving co-administering a conventional dose or a reduced dose of insulin and a glucagon peptide of the invention are provided. Methods of treating diabetes with a glucagon peptide of the invention, without co-administering insulin are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides novel methods for treating hyperglycemia and novel methods for decreasing appetite or promoting body weight loss that involve administration of a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecule (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) that activates both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor. Agonism, i.e., activation, of both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors provides an unexpected improvement compared to GLP-1 agonism alone in treating hyperglycemia. Thus, the addition of glucagon agonism provides an unexpected additive or synergistic effect, or other unexpected clinical benefit(s). Administration with a conventional dose of insulin, a reduced dose of insulin, or without insulin is contemplated according to such methods. Agonism of the glucagon receptor also has an unexpected beneficial effect compared to GLP-1 agonism alone in promoting weight loss or preventing weight gain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules include glucagon peptides of the invention, GLP-1 analogs that activate both GLP-1 and glucagon receptors, fusions of glucagon and GLP-1, or fusions of glucagon analogs and GLP-1 analogs, or chemically modified derivatives thereof. Alternatively, a compound that activates the glucagon receptor can be co-administered with a compound that activates the GLP-1 receptor (such as a GLP-1 analog, an exendin-4 analog, or derivatives thereof). The invention also contemplates co-administration of a glucagon agonist analog with a GLP-1 agonist analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods for treating hyperglycemia and/or for decreasing appetite or promoting body weight loss include administration of a glucagon analog with a modification at position 12 (e.g. Arg12), optionally in combination with modifications at \nposition\n 16 and/or 20. The methods of the invention also include administration of glucagon analogs comprising an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids within the region of \namino acids\n 12 and 29 that are separated by three intervening amino acids, \n \ne.g. positions\n \n 12 and 16, positions 13 and 17 (e.g., Lys13 Glu17 or Glu13 Lys17), positions 16 and 20, positions 17 and 21 (\ne.g. Lys17 Glu\n 21 or Glu 17 Lys 21), positions 20 and 24, or positions 24 and 28, with the optional proviso that the amino acid at \nposition\n 9 is not Glu, and optionally including a C-terminal amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment excluded from such glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules are any glucagon analogs or GLP-1 analogs in the prior art known to be useful in such a method. In another embodiment peptides described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,864,069 as acting as both a GLP-1 agonist and a glucagon antagonist for treating diabetes are also excluded as glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules. In another embodiment, excluded is the use of glucagon antagonists to treat diabetes, such as the antagonists described in Unson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n264:789-794 (1989), Ahn et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n44:3109-3116 (2001), and Sapse et al., \nMol. Med., \n8(5):251-262 (2002). In a further embodiment oxyntomodulin or a glucagon analog that contains the 8 C-terminal amino acids of oxyntomodulin (SEQ ID NO: 27) are also excluded as glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods for treating hyperglycemia are expected to be useful for a variety of types of hyperglycemia, including diabetes, diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease. Such methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll therapeutic methods, pharmaceutical compositions, kits and other similar embodiments described herein contemplate that the use of the term glucagon analogs includes all pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a bar graph representing the stability of Glucagon Cys\n21\nmaleimidoPEG\n5K \nat 37° C. incubated for 24, 48, 72, 96, 144 and 166 hours, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n represents data generated from HPLC analysis of Glucagon Cys\n21\nmaleimidoPEG\n5K \nat \npH\n 5 incubated at 37° C. for 24, 72 or 144 hours, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n represents data showing receptor mediated cAMP induction by glucagon analogs.

The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to altering glucose blood levels in the direction of normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a glucagon peptide refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia, as measured, for example, by an increase in blood glucose level. An alternative desired effect for the co-agonist analogs of the present disclosure would include treating hyperglycemia, e.g., as measured by a change in blood glucose level closer to normal, or inducing weight loss/preventing weight gain, e.g., as measured by reduction in body weight, or preventing or reducing an increase in body weight, or normalizing body fat distribution. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “purified” and like terms relate to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment. As used herein, the term “purified” does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative definition. The term “purified polypeptide” is used herein to describe a polypeptide which has been separated from other compounds including, but not limited to nucleic acid molecules, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated” requires that the referenced material be removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “peptide” encompasses a sequence of 3 or more amino acids and typically less than 50 amino acids, wherein the amino acids are naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “polypeptide” and “protein” are terms that are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acids, without regard to the length of the polymer. Typically, polypeptides and proteins have a polymer length that is greater than that of “peptides.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “glucagon peptide” as used herein includes any peptide comprising, either the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or any analog of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, including amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions or post translational modifications (e.g., methylation, acylation, ubiquitination, intramolecular covalent bonding such as lactam bridge formation, PEGylation, and the like) of the peptide, wherein the analog stimulates glucagon or GLP-1 receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon agonist” refers to a complex comprising a glucagon peptide that stimulates glucagon receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “glucagon agonist analog” is a glucagon peptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14 and SEQ ID NO: 15, or an analog of such a sequence that has been modified to include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “modification” refers to a substitution, addition or deletion of an amino acid, and includes substitution with or addition of any of the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Throughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g. position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO:1) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. For example, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the \ncorresponding position\n 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been deleted. Similarly, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 29 for a glucagon analog in which one amino acid has been added before the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, Fla.), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Mass.). Atypical amino acids may be purchased from commercial suppliers, synthesized de novo, or chemically modified or derivatized from other amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “glucagon co-agonist” is a glucagon peptide that exhibits activity at the glucagon receptor of at least about 10% to about 500% or more relative to native glucagon and also exhibits activity at the GLP-1 receptor of about at least 10% to about 200% or more relative to native GLP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecule” is a molecule that exhibits activity at the glucagon receptor of at least about 10% relative to native glucagon and also exhibits activity at the GLP-1 receptor of at least about 10% relative to native GLP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “native glucagon” refers to a peptide consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and the term “native GLP-1” is a generic term that designates GLP-1(7-36)amide (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 52), GLP-1(7-37)acid (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 50) or a mixture of those two compounds. As used herein, a general reference to “glucagon” or “GLP-1” in the absence of any further designation is intended to mean native glucagon or native GLP-1, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “substitution” refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by a different amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conservative amino acid substitution” is defined herein as exchanges within one of the following five groups:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nI. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues:\n        \n \nAla, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly;\n \n\n\n \nII. Polar, negatively charged residues and their amides and esters:\n        \n \nAsp, Asn, Glu, Gln, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid;\n \n\n\n \nIII. Polar, positively charged residues:\n        \n \nHis, Arg, Lys; Ornithine (Orn)\n \n\n\n \nIV. Large, aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, Ile, Val, Cys, Norleucine (Nle), homocysteine\n \nV. Large, aromatic residues:\n        \n \nPhe, Tyr, Trp, acetyl phenylalanine\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein the general term “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain”, refers to mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene oxide and water, in a branched or straight chain, represented by the general formula H(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nOH, wherein n is at least 9. Absent any further characterization, the term is intended to include polymers of ethylene glycol with an average total molecular weight selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain” is used in combination with a numeric suffix to indicate the approximate average molecular weight thereof. For example, PEG-5,000 refers to polyethylene glycol chain having a total molecular weight average of about 5,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pegylated” and like terms refers to a compound that has been modified from its native state by linking a polyethylene glycol chain to the compound. A “pegylated glucagon peptide” is a glucagon peptide that has a PEG chain covalently bound to the glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a general reference to a peptide is intended to encompass peptides that have modified amino and carboxy termini. For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “linker” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “dimer” is a complex comprising two subunits covalently bound to one another via a linker. The term dimer, when used absent any qualifying language, encompasses both homodimers and heterodimers. A homodimer comprises two identical subunits, whereas a heterodimer comprises two subunits that differ, although the two subunits are substantially similar to one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “charged amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a side chain that is negatively charged (i.e., de-protonated) or positively charged (i.e., protonated) in aqueous solution at physiological pH. For example negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homocysteic acid, and homoglutamic acid, whereas positively charged amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. Charged amino acids include the charged amino acids among the 20 amino acidscommonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “acidic amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a second acidic moiety, including for example, a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. Exemplary alkyls include methyl, ethyl, and linear propyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom in the backbone of the structure. Suitable heteroatoms for purposes herein include but are not limited to N, S, and O.\n\n\n \nEMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides glucagon peptides with increased or decreased activity at the glucagon receptor, or the GLP-1 receptor, or at both receptors. The invention also provides glucagon peptides with altered selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintained or increased activity at the glucagon receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3 of native glucagon with a glutamine analog (e.g. (Dab(Ac)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced activity at the glucagon receptor is provided, e.g., by substitution of the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 with an acidic, basic, or hydrophobic amino acid as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (e.g. around residues 12-29). In some embodiments, such modifications permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, for example, positions 12 and 16, or 16 and 20, or and 24, as described herein. In other embodiments, such modifications include insertion or substitution modifications that introduce one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids, e.g. AIB at one or more of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 16, 20, 21 or 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors for peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular brige, is provided by covalently attaching an acyl or alkyl group to to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the peptide, wherein the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10. Further increased activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors for such peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge, may be achieved by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10. Suitable spacers are described herein and include, but not limited to spacers that are 3 to 10 atoms in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided in glucagon analogs comprising the C-terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. GLP-1 activity in such analogs comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at position 18, 28 or 29, or at position 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRestoration of glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \n \npositions\n \n 1 and 2 is provided by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, for example, positions 12 and 16, or 16 and 20, or 20 and 24, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further modest increase in GLP-1 potency is provided by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 to be Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity and which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the modifications described above can also be combined with other modifications that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action. Alternatively, any of the modifications described above can be combined with other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at positions 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after \nposition\n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., \npH\n 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25.C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 or 29, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(C) Increasing, by modification of the aspartic acid at \nposition\n 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(D) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at \nposition\n 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the Gln at \n \nposition\n \n 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ala, Ser, Thr, or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. Stability can be increased by modification of Asp at \nposition\n 21, e.g. by substitution with Glu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(E) Increasing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(F) Conservative or non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29; deletions at one or more of \npositions\n 27, 28 or 29; or a deletion of amino acid 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(G) Adding C-terminal extensions as described herein;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(H) Increasing half-life in circulation and/or extending the duration of action and/or delaying the onset of action, for example, through acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(I) Homodimerization or heterodimerization as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide may comprise a total of 1, up to 2, up to 3, up to 4, up to 5, up to 6, up to 7, up to 8, up to 9, or up to 10 amino acid modifications relative to the native glucagon sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include substitution of His at \nposition\n 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr, Phe, Trp or amino-Phe);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSer at \nposition\n 2 with Ala;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsubstitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsubstitution of Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsubstitution of Asp at \nposition\n 15 with Glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsubstitution of Ser at \nposition\n 16 with Thr or AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment disclosed herein is directed to a glucagon agonist that has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 1) to enhance the peptide's potency at the glucagon receptor. Surprisingly, applicants have discovered that the normally occurring serine at \nposition\n 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) can be substituted with select acidic amino acids to enhance the potency of glucagon, in terms of its ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis in a validated in vitro model assay (see Example 14). More particularly, this substitution enhances the potency of the analog at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, and up to 10-fold greater at the glucagon receptor. This substitution also enhances the analog's activity at the GLP-1 receptor at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold relative to native glucagon, but selectivity is maintained for the glucagon receptor over the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the serine residue at \nposition\n 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid, homocysteic acid, threonine or glycine. In accordance with one embodiment the serine residue at \nposition\n 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in one embodiment the serine residue is substituted with glutamic acid. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide having enhanced specificity for the glucagon receptor comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10 or a glucagon agonist analog thereof, wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid retains its native carboxylic acid group. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist comprising the sequence of NH\n2\n-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Glu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH (SEQ ID NO: 10) is provided, wherein the peptide exhibits approximately fivefold enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, relative to native glucagon as measured by the in vitro cAMP assay of Example 14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon peptides of the present invention can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility and stability in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while retaining the high biological activity relative to native glucagon. Hydrophilic moieties such as PEG groups can be attached to the glucagon peptides under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, 5-pyridyl, and alpha-halogenated acyl group (e.g., alpha-iodo acetic acid, alpha-bromoacetic acid, alpha-chloroacetic acid). If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled. See, for example, Kinstler et al., \nAdv. Drug. Delivery Rev. \n54: 477-485 (2002); Roberts et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Rev. \n54: 459-476 (2002); and Zalipsky et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Rev. \n16: 157-182 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, an amino/acid residue on the glucagon peptide having a thiol is modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG. In some embodiments, the thiol is modified with maleimide-activated PEG in a Michael addition reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some embodiments, the thiol is modified with a haloacetyl-activated PEG in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly(.beta.-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by α1-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD. Linear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, introduction of hydrophilic groups at \n \npositions\n \n 17, 21, and 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 are anticipated to improve the solubility and stability of the high potency glucagon analog in solutions having a physiological pH. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation. Suitable hydrophilic moieties include any water soluble polymers known in the art, including PEG, homo- or co-polymers of PEG, a monomethyl-substituted polymer of PEG (mPEG), or polyoxyethylene glycerol (POG). In accordance with one embodiment the hydrophilic group comprises a polyethylene (PEG) chain. More particularly, in one embodiment the glucagon peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 7 wherein a PEG chain is covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids present at \n \npositions\n \n 21 and 24 of the glucagon peptide and the carboxy terminal amino acid of the peptide has the carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses other conjugates in which glucagon peptides of the invention are linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate moiety include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteinyl residues are most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid, chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-1′-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na \nof the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N═C═N—R′), where R and R′ are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl)carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected form the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins. In one embodiment the plasma protein moiety of the conjugate is albumin or transferin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J. Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol. Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A; E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion Protein and Terminal Extension\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses glucagon fusion peptides or proteins wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. More particularly, the fusion glucagon peptide may comprise a glucagon agonist of SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 further comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR) linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide. In one embodiment the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR) is bound to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide through a peptide bond. Applicants have discovered that in glucagon fusion peptides comprising the C-terminal extension peptide of Exendin-4 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 26 or SEQ ID NO: 29), substitution of the native threonine residue at position 29 with glycine dramatically increases GLP-1 receptor activity. This amino acid substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon analogs for the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a lactam bridge between \n \namino acids\n \n 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein. In one embodiment a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is provided, comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide portion of the glucagon fusion peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 5 wherein a PEG chain, when present at \n \npositions\n \n 17, 21, 24, or the C-terminal amino acid, or at both 21 and 24, is selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. More particularly, in one embodiment the glucagon peptide segment is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, and SEQ ID NO: 63, wherein the PEG chain is selected from the range of 500 to 5,000. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide is a fusion peptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 55 and SEQ ID NO: 65 wherein the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 65 is linked to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 55.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCharge Neutral C-Terminus\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, an additional chemical modification of the glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 10 bestows increased GLP-1 receptor potency to a point where the relative activity at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors is virtually equivalent. Accordingly, in one embodiment a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is provided wherein the terminal amino acid of the glucagon peptides of the present invention have an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group that is present on the native amino acid. The relative activity of the glucagon analog at the respective glucagon and GLP-1 receptors can be adjusted by further modifications to the glucagon peptide to produce analogs demonstrating about 40% to about 500% or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and about 20% to about 200% or more of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, e.g. 50-fold, 100-fold or more increase relative to the normal activity of glucagon at the GLP-1 receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit up to about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit up to about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilization of the Alpha Helix/Intramolecular Bridges\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment glucagon analogs are provided that exhibit enhanced GLP-1 receptor agonist activity wherein an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminus of the peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through one or more covalent bonds, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a covlent intramolecular bridge. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a non-covalent intramolecular bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25). More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26). In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22). In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, Glu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther exemplary embodiments include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at \nposition\n 12 with Lys at \nposition\n 16; native Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Glu at \nposition\n 16; Glu at \nposition\n 16 with Lys at \nposition\n 20; Lys at \nposition\n 16 with Glu at \nposition\n 20; Glu at \nposition\n 20 with Lys at \nposition\n 24; Lys at \nposition\n 20 with Glu at \nposition\n 24; Glu at \nposition\n 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at \nposition\n 24 with Glu at position 28.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog is provided that exhibits glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist activity wherein the analog comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, 47, 48 and 49. In one embodiment the side chains are covalently bound to one another, and in one embodiment the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring. The size of the lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys12 and a Glu16 or alternatively between a \nGlu\n 12 and a Lys16). In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog of SEQ ID NO: 45 is provided wherein at least one lactam ring is formed between the side chains of an amino acid pair selected from the group consisting of amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28. In one embodiment a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is provided wherein the co-agonist comprises a glucagon peptide analog of SEQ ID NO: 20 wherein the peptide comprises an intramolecular lactam bridge formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16 or between amino acid positions 16 and 20. In one embodiment a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein an intramolecular lactam bridge is formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16, between amino acid positions 16 and 20, or between amino acid positions 20 and 24 and the amino acid at position 29 is glycine, wherein the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 29 is linked to the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 20. In a further embodiment the amino acid at position 28 is aspartic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 10, 14, and 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can can comprise (CH\n2\n)n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafineister et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., \nScience \n305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., \nAngew, Chem., Int. Ed. \n37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., \nTetrahedron Letters \n45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., \nJ. Peptide Res. \n51: 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., \nBull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. \n65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, \nPure Appl. Chem. \n68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, \nJ. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. \n1599-1600 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1,4-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane) between two Glu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, \nExperientia \n20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, \nTetrahedron \n55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 9063-9064 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha helix of the glucagon peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, \nJ. Peptide. Sci. \n9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the glucagon peptide with enhanced GLP-1 activity comprises (a) one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid and optionally, (b) a C-terminal amide. In some aspects, it is to be appreciated that such glucagon peptides specifically lack an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge, that stabilizes the alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around positions 12-29). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of glucagon is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., amino iso-butyric acid (MB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-1-carboxylic acid). For example, substitution of \nposition\n 16 with AIB enhances GLP-1 activity, in the absence of an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a salt bridge) or a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam). In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB. Such a glucagon peptide may further comprise one or more of the other modifications described herein, including, but not limited to, acylation, alkylation, pegylation, deletion of 1-2 amino acids at the C-terminus, addition of and/or substitution with charged amino acids at the C-terminus, replacement of the C-terminal carboxylate with an amide, addition of a C-terminal extension, and conservative and/or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, such as substitution of Met at \nposition\n 27 with Leu or Nle, substitution of Asp at \nposition\n 15 with Glu (or like amino acid), substitution at \nposition\n 1 and/or 2 with amino acids which achieve DPP-IV protease resistance, substitution of Ser at \nposition\n 2 with Ala, substitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe, substitution of Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Arg, substitution of Ser at \nposition\n 16 with Thr or AIB, substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 with Asp, Glu, or AIB, substitution of Ser at \nposition\n 16 with Glu or Thr, Arg at position 18 with Ala, Gln at \nposition\n 20 with Lys, Asp at \nposition\n 21 with Glu, and Gln at \nposition\n 24 with Asn or Cys. In some embodiments, the foregoing glucagon peptide comprises a Gln or Gly at position 29 or addition of a C-terminal extension, e.g., GGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 26) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 28. In a specific aspect, the glucagon peptide comprises one or more of an amide group in place of the C-terminal carboxylate, an acyl group, e.g., a C16 fatty acid, and a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., a polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in another specific aspect, the glucagon peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-25, 30-64, and 66-555 comprising no more than ten modifications relative to SEQ ID NO: 1 and comprising one or more amino acid substitutions with AIB at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 20, 21, and/or 24, wherein the peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge, between the side chains of two amino acids of the peptide. Accordingly, in a more specific aspect, the glucagon peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 556-561.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. In specific embodiments, the acyl or alkyl group is not naturally occurring on an amino acid. In certain aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amion acid at \nposition\n 10. In exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 556-561 and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge exhibit enhanced activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors as compared to the non-acylated counterpart peptides. Further enhancement in activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors can be achieved by the acylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the peptide. Acylation and alkylation, with or without incorporating spacers, are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification at \nPosition\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the glucagon peptide with enhanced GLP-1 activity comprises (a) an amino acid substitution of His at \nposition\n 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid and (b) an intramolecular bridge that stabilizes that alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of the molecule (e.g. around positions 12-29). In a specific embodiment, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 is Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl-Ala, methyl-Tyr, or 3-amino Tyr. In a specific aspect, the intramolecular bridge is between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, i.e., between the side chains of amino acids i and i+4. In some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is a lactam bridge. In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the glucagon peptide comprises a large, aromatic amino acid at \nposition\n 1 and a lactam bridge between the amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 16 and 20 of the peptide. Such a glucagon peptide may further comprise one or more (e.g., two, three, four, five or more) of the other modifications described herein. For example, the glucagon peptide can comprise an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the glucagon peptide comprises that amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 555.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide comprises an acyl group, e.g., an acyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid. The acyl group causes the peptide to have one or more of (i) a prolonged half-life in circulation, (ii) a delayed onset of action, (iii) an extended duration of action, (iv) an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and (v) increased potency at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. As shown herein, acylated glucagon peptides do not exhibit decreased activity at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors in comparison to the corresponding unacylated glucagon peptide. Rather, in some instances, acylated glucagon peptides actually exhibit increased activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. Accordingly, the potency of the acylated analogs is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon co-agonist analogs, if not enhanced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group which is attached to the glucagon peptide via an ester, thioester, or amide linkage for purposes of prolonging half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of and/or extending the duration of action and/or improving resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that glucagon and/or GLP-1 activity is retained, if not enhanced. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29. In specific embodiments, acylation occurs at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the glucagon peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam bridge). Such acylated peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge demonstrate enhanced activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors as compared to the corresponding non-acylated peptides lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge and in comparison to the corresponding peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge acylated at a position other than \nposition\n 10. As shown herein, acylation at \nposition\n 10 can even transform a glucagon analog having little activity at the glucagon receptor to a glucagon analog having activity at both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. Accordingly, the position at which acylation occurs can alter the overall activity profile of the glucagon analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at \nposition\n 10 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., \nposition\n 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly acylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, acylation is at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly or doubly α-substituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Om, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer, the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the amino acid of the spacer can be any amino acid. For example, the amino acid of the spacer can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the amino acid of the spacer can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instance in which the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer is acylated, the amino acid of the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated.

Without being held to any particular theory, it is believed that alkylation of glucagon peptides will achieve similar, if not the same, effects as acylation of the glucagon peptides, e.g., a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlkylation can be carried out at any positions within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that the glucagon activity is retained. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29. The alkyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group. Glucagon peptides may be alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include alkylation at \nposition\n 10 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., \nposition\n 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by direct alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide.

In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the alkylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the alkyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the alkyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 of the glucagon peptide.

Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA). Accordingly, applicants believe that the bioactivity of oxyntomodulin can be retained (i.e., appetite suppression and induced weight loss/weight maintenance), while improving the solubility and stability of the compound and improving the pharmacokinetics, by substituting the glucagon peptide portion of oxyntomodulin with the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein. In addition applicants also believe that a truncated Oxyntomodulin molecule comprising a glucagon peptide of the invention, having the terminal four amino acids of oxyntomodulin removed will also be effective in suppressing appetite and inducing weight loss/weight maintenance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention also encompasses the modified glucagon peptides of the present invention that have a carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28. These compounds can be administered to individuals to induce weight loss or prevent weight gain.

It is a powerful stimulator of a receptor known as GLP-1. This peptide has also been reported to suppress appetite and induce weight loss. Applicants have found that the terminal sequence of Exendin-4 when added at the carboxy terminus of glucagon improves the solubility and stability of glucagon without compromising the bioactivity of glucagon. In one embodiment the terminal ten amino acids of Exendin-4 (i.e., the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS)) are linked to the carboxy terminus of a glucagon peptide of the present disclosure.

\nAcylated and/or PEGylated peptides were prepared as follows. Peptides were synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry was used as described by Schnolzer et al., \nInt. J. Peptide Protein Res. \n40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) was substituted with an N ε-FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removed FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free c-amino Lys residue was achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N—BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA resulted in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins were neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, dried, and then cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0° C. for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution was used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution was then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides were purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH3CN/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac C18 22 mm×250 mm protein column was used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally completed elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions were pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP-HPLC. Pure fractions were lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides. Yields typically ranged from 10 mg to 100 mg depending on the synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a peptide comprises a lactam bridge and target residues to be acylated, acylation is carried out as described above upon addition of that amino acid to the peptide backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) was reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature commenced for 4-6 hours and the reaction analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appeared distinctly from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification was performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial peptide purification. Elution occurred around buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide were found and lyophilized. Yields were above 50%, varying per reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides were assayed for biological activity, by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with either the glucagon receptor (GLUR) or GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and a luciferase gene linked to a cAMP responsive element. The transfected cells were serum deprived by culturing for 16 hours in DMEM supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum and then incubated for 5 hours with serial dilutions of the selected analogs and either Glucagon or GLP-1 as standards, respectively. Peptide absorbance readings were obtained from UV Absorbance measurements at 280 nm on a \nGenesys\n 6 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Beer's Law was used to calculate solution concentrations based on the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in each analog. At the end of the incubation, 100 μL LucLite luminescence substrate reagent was added to each well, the plate sealed and shaken, and placed into a Wallac Trilux luminescence counter for cAMP detection. Effective 50% concentrations (EC50) were calculated using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mas.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylated glucagon-based co-agonist peptides were prepared. In vitro results for a selection of these peptides are shown in Table 13. Although the unacylated peptide, like native glucagon, was insoluble in phosphate-buffered saline solutions at 1 mg/mL concentrations, acylation was observed to enhance solubility of the peptide at neutral pH.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceptor Activation Curves and nM EC\n50 \nvalues for Acylated Peptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nN\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n15\n\n\n>100\n\n\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE16 K20-glucagon-NH2\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n 9\n\n\n    0.18\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE16 K20-glucagon-NH2 with\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n 8\n\n\n    0.40\n\n\n 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n10\n—C\n16\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nE16 K20-glucagon-NH2 with\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n 8\n\n\n    0.14\n\n\n 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n10\n—W—C\n16\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nE16 K20-glucagon-NH2 with\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n 8\n\n\n    0.12\n\n\n 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n10\n—C\n18\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nE16 K20-glucagon-NH2 with\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n11\n\n\n    0.05\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n10\n—W—C\n18\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n7.42\n\n\n 6\n\n\n    0.07\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll four acylated peptides exhibited increased potency at the GLP-1 receptor.

The K\n10\n-W—C\n18 \nacylated and PEGylated peptide exhibited about ten-fold potency losses at both receptors. This series of peptides shows that the position ten acylation is compatible with a PEGylation in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, \ne.g. position\n 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious acylated glucagon co-agonist peptides were made as essentially described in Example 19 and tested for in vivo activity.

The Lys10 was acylated with a C8 fatty acid chain, a C14 fatty acid chain, a C16 fatty acid chain, or a C18 fatty acid chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity at the GLP-1 receptor of each of the acylated peptides was assayed as described in Example 14 and compared to the activity of GLP-1(7-37)acid (SEQ ID NO: 50) as a control.

The acylated glucagon analogs were as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“(C16) Glucagon Amide” comprised the amino acid sequence of wild-type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) with the Tyr at position 10 modified to an acylated Lys residue, wherein the acylated Lys comprised a C16 fatty acyl group, and the C-terminal carboxylate replaced with an amide group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide” comprised the same structure of C16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at position 10 through a gamma-Glu-gamma-Glu dipeptide spacer (see structure of acylated Lys below);\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“AA-C16 Glucagon Amide” comprised the same structure of C16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at \nposition\n 10 through an Ala-Ala dipeptide spacer; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“βAβA-C16 Glucagon Amide” comprised the same structure of C16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at \nposition\n 10 through an β-Ala-β-Ala dipeptide spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weight of the mice was monitored daily and the total change in body weight (%) is shown in \nFIG. 22\n. As shown in \nFIG. 22\n, most of the acylated glucagon peptides at each dose caused a reduction in body weight. While Liraglutide demonstrated an approximate 12% decrease in body weight, the glucagon analog peptide γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide exhibited the greatest ability to cause weight loss in mice at the matched dose. Even the lower dose of γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide caused a substantial decrease in body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fat mass of the mice was measured on \nDay\n 7 of the study. As shown in \nFIG. 23\n, the mice which were administered 100 nmol/kg γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide exhibited the lowest fat mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels of the mice were also monitored during the course of the assay. As shown in \nFIG. 24\n, the glucagon analog peptide γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide at the higher dose worked as well as Liraglutide to decrease blood glucose levels in mice.\n\n\n \nExample 33\n\n\n \n \n \nAcylation of a glucagon analog peptide having GLP-1 activity was evaluated as follows.

It also recruited interest and investment in obesity research as a means to identify environmental and pharmacologic approaches to manage what has become a global epidemic of disease. Sufficiently efficacious and safe pharmacologic treatment for obesity has yet to emerge and surgery constitutes the only proven option to sustained weight loss. It is reported herein that the combinatorial efficacy of receptor agonism at two endocrine hormonal receptors to achieve potent satiety inducing and lipolytic effects in a single peptide of sustained duration of action. Two specific glucagon analogs with activity at the GLP1-R comparable to native GLP-1, but differing from each other in their level of glucagon receptor agonism were studied pharmacologically in rodent obesity models. Once weekly administration of these pegylated peptides selected from a series of high potency analogs with differential glucagon and GLP-1 activity normalized adiposity and glucose tolerance levels in diet induced obese mice (average body weight ca. 50 g) within a month. Body weight loss was a consequence of body fat loss resulting from decreased food intake and increased energy expenditure, which increased with the level of glucagon receptor agonism. These co-agonist compounds also normalized glucose and lipid metabolism including liver steatosis. Effects were dose dependent and successfully repeated in diet induced obese rats. These preclinical studies indicate that when full GLP-1 agonism is enhanced with an appropriate degree of glucagon receptor activation, body fat reduction can be substantially and safely accelerated. The findings shown herein establish a basis for clinical testing and suggest an attractive novel treatment option for the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n \nExample 41\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following materials and methods pertain to the experiments described in Examples 42 to 51.\n\n\n \nBoc Peptide Synthesis and Cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptide syntheses were performed using 0.2 mmol 4-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (Midwest Biotech, Fishers, Ind.) on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer. Solid-phase peptide syntheses utilized in situ neutralization for Boc-chemistry (Schnolzer, M. et al., \nInternational Journal of Peptide Research and Therapeutics, \n13:31-44 (2007)). Completed peptidyl-resins were treated with HF/p-cresol (10:0.5 v/v) at 0° C. for 1 h. HF was removed in vacuo and the deprotected peptide was precipitated and washed in diethyl ether. The peptide was dissolved in 20% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid and lyophilized. Most peptides were prepared by Boc chemistry. The following side chain protecting groups were used for Boc-amino acids (Midwest Biotech): Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHex), Asn(Xan), Glu(OcHex), His(BOM), Lys(2-C1-Z), Ser(Bzl), Thr(Bzl), Trp(CH0), Tyr(Br-Z). Peptide molecular weights were confirmed by electrospray ionization or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and purified as described elsewhere.\n\n\n \nLactam Synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \nCyclized peptides with i to i+4 lactam formation were synthesized on resin. Glu(OFm)-OH gamma ester (Peptides International, Louisville, Ky.) and Lys(Fmoc)-OH (Peptides International) were substituted for Glu(OcHex) and Lys(2-C1-Z) at positions involved in lactam formation. The fully protected peptidyl-resin was treated with 20% piperidine in DMF for 45 minutes to remove Fmoc and OFm protecting groups. On resin, lactam formation was achieved after treatment with 5 equivalents of benzotriazole-1-yloxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Fluka) in DMF/DIEA for 5 h. Lactam formation was confirmed by ninhydrin analysis and mass reduction of 18 relative to the open form of the peptide.\n\n\n \nPeptide Purification.\n\n\n \n \n \nFollowing cleavage from the resin, crude peptide extracts were analyzed by analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Analytical separations were conducted in 0.1% TFA with an acetonitrile gradient on a Zorbax C8 column (0.46×5 cm). After analytical analysis, the crude extract was purified by semi-preparative chromatography in 0.1% TFA with an acetonitrile gradient on a Vydac C4 or C18 column (2.2×25 cm). Pegylated peptides were purified using the same conditions. Preparative fractions were analyzed for purity (>95%) by analytical reverse-phase HPLC utilizing the conditions listed for analytical separations. Peptide masses and purity were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Pegylated peptides showed a broad mass range spanning 43400 by MALDI-TOF. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at 4° C.\n\n\n \nPegylation of Peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified peptides were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide-40K (Chirotech Technology Ltd, Cambridge) in 7M urea/50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Reaction progress was monitored by analytical reverse-phase HPLC and free peptide was consumed within 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched in 0.1% TFA, purified and characterized as described elsewhere.\n\n\n \n \nGlucagon and GLP-I Receptor-Mediated cAMP Synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach peptide analog was tested for its ability to stimulate cAMP production through the glucagon (Gcg) and GLP-1 receptors. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the GcgR or GLP-1R cDNAs and a luciferase reporter gene-linked to a cAMP response element (CRE). Cells were serum deprived for 16 h by culturing in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah). Serial dilutions of Glucagon and GLP-1 analogs were added to 96-well poly-D-Lysine-coated plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) containing co-transfected HEK293 cells, and plates were incubated for 5 h at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. Following incubation, an equivalent volume (100 μL) of LucLite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mas.) was added to each well and the plate was shaken for 3 min at 800 rpm. The plate was incubated for 10 min in the dark and light output was quantified on a MicroBeta1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mas.). Effective 50% concentrations (EC50) were calculated by Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mas.).\n\n\n \nCircular Dichroism Measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides were dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 5.9 with increasing concentrations of TFE, and peptide concentrations were quantified. Each sample was diluted to 10 μM for CD measurements. CD data were collected on a JASCO J-715 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter with constant nitrogen stream and temperature control of the 1 mm path length cell set at 25° C. Spectral data were accumulated for 5 scans from 270-190 nm with a scan speed of 100 nm/min and 1 nm wavelength step. Solvent signal was subtracted and data were smoothed (Savitzky and Golay, \nAnal. Chem. \n36:1627 (1964)); in the JASCO Spectra Manager software. Millidegree values obtained were converted to mean residue ellipticity with units of deg·cm\n2\n·dmol\n−1\n. Calculated mean residue ellipticity values were input into DICHROWEB (Whitmore and Wallace, \nBiopolymers \n89:392-400 (2008); Whitmore and Wallace, \nNucleic Acids Research \n32:W668-W673 (2004) to obtain percent helicity values.\n\n\n \nAnimals.\n\n\n \n \n \nC57BI/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and fed a diabetogenic diet from Research Diets, a high sucrose diet with 58% kcal from fat. Mice were single or group-housed on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at 22° C. with free access to food and water. All studies were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n \nBody Composition Measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhole body composition (fat and lean mass) was measured using NMR technology (EchoMRI, Houston, Tex.).\n\n\n \nEnergy Balance Physiology Measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \nEnergy intake and expenditure, as well as home-cage activity, were assessed by using a combined indirect calorimetry system (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany). Oxygen consumption and CO\n2 \nproduction were measured every 45 min for a total of 120 h (including 12 h of adaptation) to determine the respiratory quotient and energy expenditure. Food and water intake and meal patterns were determined continuously for 120 h at the same time as the indirect calorimetry assessments by integration of scales into the sealed cage environment. Meals were defined as food intake events with a minimum duration of 60 s, and a break of 300 s between food intake events. Home-cage locomotor activity was determined using a multidimensional infrared light beam system with beams scanning the bottom and top levels of the cage, and activity being expressed as beam breaks. Stationary motor activity (fidgeting) was defined as consecutive breaks of one single light beam at cage-bottom level, ambulatory movement as breaks of any two different light beams at cage-bottom level, and rearing as simultaneous breaks of light beams on both cage-bottom and the top level.\n\n\n \nBlood Parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected after a 6-h fast from tail veins using EDTA-coated Microvette tubes (Sarstedt, Nuremberg, Germany) and immediately chilled on ice. After 15 min of centrifugation at 3,000 g and 4° C., plasma was stored at −80° C. Plasma insulin was quantified by a radioimmunoassay from Linco (Sensitive Rat Insulin RIA; Linco Research, St. Charles, Mo.). Plasma TGs and cholesterol levels were measured by enzymatic assay kits (Thermo Electron, Waltham, Mass.). Samples were analyzed individually with the exception that pooled samples (0.25 ml) from 5 animals/group were subjected to fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) gel filtration on two \nSuperose\n 6 columns connected in series for lipoprotein separation. All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \nGlucose Tolerance Test.\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the determination of glucose tolerance, mice were subjected to 6 h of fasting and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2 g glucose/kg body wt (50% D-glucose (Sigma) in 0.9% saline) for the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Tail blood glucose levels (mg/dl) were measured by using a hand-held glucometer (TheraSense Freestyle) before (0 min) and at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection.\n\n\n \nWestern Blot of WAT HSI.\n\n\n \n \n \nAdipose tissue was placed in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and lysed in ice cold RIPA buffer (1×PBS, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium doxycholate, 0.1% SDS with 50 mM NaF, 0.5 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM Na Vanadate, 20 μg/ml Aprotinin, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin) using a tissue lyser (Retsch, Inc Newtown, Pa. Cat. # 85210) at 30 hz for 3 min. Samples were spun at 12,000 rpm for 15 min (4° C.) at which time the internatant was removed to a new tube and sonicated for 15 sec on ice. Samples were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min (4° C.) and the internatant was collected to a new tube. Samples were again spun at 19,000 rpm for 10 min (4° C.) and the internatant collected to a new tube. An aliquot of sample was then taken for protein assay. Samples were then boiled in 4×SDS/DTT buffer for 2 min. 50 μg of protein from cell lysate were subjected to SDS/PAGE on 9% (w/v) acrylamide resolving gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nictrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and probed with primary antibodies of interest (HSL (4107)) from Cell Signaling; Phospho-HSL (ser 660) (4126) from Cell Signaling). After washing, primary antibody detection was performed using either HRP-conjugated anti-(rabbit IgG) or anti-(mouse IgG) (HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad (170-6515 & 170-6516)) and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to CL-Xposure film (Pierce).\n\n\n \nImmunohistochemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \nParaffin embedded sections of white epididymal adipose tissue (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin as described (Ogden, C. L. et al. \nJAMA \n295:1549-1555 (2006)). For each individual mouse tissue block, adipocyte size of 100 cells from each of three different high-power fields was quantified as areal measurement using Image Pro Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, Md., USA).\n\n\n \nOil Red Staining.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo visualize lipid accumulation in liver tissue, 4-8 mm cross-sections of the livers that were harvested at sacrifice were stained with \nOil Red\n 0 dye. Images at both 20× and 40× magnification were acquired using a [compound-lens] microscope.\n\n\n \n \nQuantitative RT-PCR procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals were sacrificed by decapitation in the fed state (1-4 h after the morning feeding) and various tissues were sampled, freeze-clamped, and stored at −80° C. for subsequent measurement of mRNA expression of PEPCK, G6P, and HPRT (housekeeping) by real-time quantitative PCR (icycler, BioRad).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using a RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Ca# 74804) using the standard protocol. RNA concentrations and purity were determined by spectrophotometry using the Nanodrop. cDNA templates for RT-PCR were obtained using 2 μg of total RNA. Reverse transcription reaction was performed with 10×DNase I Reaction Buffer, DNase I, Amp Grade, 1 U/μl, depc-H\n2\nO, 25 mM EDTA, 10 mM dNTP Mix, oligo(dT)20 (50 μM), 5× First-Strand Buffer, 0.1 M DTT, RNaseOUT, and SuperScript 111 (Invitrogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesized cDNAs were further amplified by PCR using the fluorescent dye SYBR green (BioRad, Ca# 1708882) containing a final concentration of 0.5 μM of forward and reverse primers. Product purity was confirmed by dissociation curves. No-template controls were included in all assays, yielding no consistent amplification. A standard curve was used to obtain the relative concentration of PEPCK or G6P, and the results were corrected according to the concentration of HPRT, used as housekeeping genes. The results are expressed as percent of vehicle, setting the mean of the vehicle group at 100% and then calculating each individual value of the 3 groups of animals studied.\n\n\n \nPrimer Sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \nPrimer sequences for PEPCK, G6P, and HPRT were taken from the NIH website and primers were generated by IDT DNA.\n\n\n \nReverse Transcription and Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \nCD68 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described (Nomiyama, T. et al. \nJournal of Clinical Investigation \n117:2877-2888 (2007)). Briefly, upon sacrifice, 100 mg epididymal adipose tissue was homogenized in TRIZOL and total mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR reactions were performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green I system (Bio-Rad). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to values for TFIIB mRNA expression. Mouse primer sequences used were as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 638)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCD68, 5′-CAAGGTCCAGGGAGGTTGTG-3′ (forward),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 639)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-CCAAAGGTAAGCTGTCCATAAGGA-3′ (reverse);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 640)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTFIIB, 5′-CTCTCCCAAGAGTCACATGTCC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 641)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-CAATAACTCGGTCCCCTACAAC-3′ (reverse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStatistical Analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \nUnless indicated otherwise, all statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism one-way ANOVAs and column statistics. Stated P values are for one-way analysis of variance. All results are presented as means±SE. (Receptor activation data is ±S.D.).\n\n\n \nExample 42\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo glucagon peptides, Peptides X and Y, comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with amino acid modifications were made as described herein. Both peptides comprised AIB at \nposition\n 2, Glu at \nposition\n 16, Gln at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at \nposition\n 20, Glu at \nposition\n 21, Ile at position 23, and Cys at \nposition\n 24. Site-specific 40-kd pegylation was achieved at Cys at \nposition\n 24 through reaction with a maleimide-functionalized linear peg to yield Peptide X-PEG and Y-PEG. Peptides Y and Y-PEG differed from Peptides X and X-PEG, respectively, in that a single side-chain lactam bridge was introduced in the middle of Peptide Y or Peptide Y-PEG to stabilize the secondary structure and enhance glucagon agonism. The two side chains of Glu at \nposition\n 16 and Lys at \nposition\n 20 were covalently coupled in the course of peptide assembly as a side-chain amide. This macrocyclization of the peptide represents a 21-atom lactam. Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG were tested for solubility and were found to be soluble in physiological buffers at concentrations that exceed 25 mg/ml, and Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG proved completely resistant to ex vivo incubation with plasma for periods of one week.\n\n\n \nExample 43\n\n\n \n \n \nThe secondary conformation of peptides when solubilized in various concentrations of aqueous trifluoroethanol (TFE) was analyzed by circular dichroism (\nFIG. 25\n). Glucagon was the least helical peptide tested, and had calculated helicity of 10, 15 and 33% in TFE solutions of 0, 10 and 20%, respectively (Table 29). Under the same experimental conditions, GLP-1 had enhanced helicity of 14, 29 and 55%, demonstrating that these two peptides differ in primary as well as secondary structure. There were no significant changes in the helicity of Peptides X and Y when pegylated, despite the fact that the pegylated portions represent more than 90% of the molecule by mass (Table 29). In contrast, the apparent helicity of Peptide Y in phosphate buffer in the absence of TFE was approximately double that of Peptide X, from 17% to 36%. Consequently, the pegylated forms of these two chimeric peptides (Peptide X-PEG and Peptide Y-PEG) differed appreciably in secondary structure (\nFIG. 25\n) and the differences in biological properties are likely a function of these secondary structural differences.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nPercent Helicity\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n0\n% TFE\n \n\n\n10\n% TFE\n \n\n\n20\n% TFE\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon\n \n \n \n \n\n\n10\n\n\n15\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n14\n\n\n29\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide X\n\n\n17\n\n\n34\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nPeptide\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n31\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nX-PEG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide Y\n\n\n36\n\n\n35\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n37\n\n\n51\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY-PEG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 44\n\n\n \n \n \nThe two peptides (Peptides X and Y) and their 40-kd pegylated derivatives (Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG) were assessed for their ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis in cell-based CRE-luciferase reporter assays (\nFIG. 26\n). As shown in Table 30, native glucagon activated glucagon receptors half-maximally at an effective concentration (EC50) of 0.055±0.014 nM and the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) at a much higher concentration, EC50 of 3.29±0.39 nM. In contrast, GLP-1 activated its receptor with an EC50 of 0.028±0.009 nM and proved highly specific in that interaction at the glucagon receptor (GcgR) occurred at an EC50 exceeding 1 μM. The dynamic range in specificity exhibited for the native ligands at their receptors is in excess of a million. The potency of Peptide X-PEG at GLP-1R was twice that of native GLP-1 and even more enhanced at GcgR in a relative sense. However, the GcgR activity was only approximately 10% that of native glucagon. The introduction of the lactam restored full glucagon agonism without a change at GLP-1R. Consequently, Peptide Y-PEG is a fully potent, nearly balanced co-agonist relative to the native ligands at the two respective receptors. PEGylation of each peptide reduced potency by as much as ten-fold at GcgR and five-fold at GLP-1R. The slightly enhanced loss in activity at GcgR may be a function of the greater relative importance of the C-terminal sequence to glucagon receptor interaction. The pegylated peptides (Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG) were slightly less potent at GLP-1R than native GLP-1 but still had a subnanomolar EC50. Peptide X-PEG is seven-fold more selective than the lactam version of this peptide, i.e., Peptide Y-PEG, at the GLP-1R. Therefore, these two DPP-4-resistant peptides are suitable for sustained in vivo time-action experiments and well-matched for GLP-1R agonism, but differ in glucagon agonism.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon Receptor\n\n\nGLP-1 Receptor\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEC50\n\n\nStandard\n\n\n% activity of \n\n\nEC50\n\n\nStandard\n\n\n% activity of \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nDeviation\n\n\nnative glucagon\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nDeviation\n\n\nnative GLP-1\n\n\nSelectivity*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n0.055\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n100.00\n\n\n3.293\n\n\n0.389\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n0.009\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n<0.008\n\n\n0.028\n\n\n0.009\n\n\n100.00\n\n\n>12500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide X\n\n\n0.585\n\n\n0.125\n\n\n9.38\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n0.002\n\n\n202.12\n\n\n21.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide X- \n\n\n2.895\n\n\n0.963\n\n\n1.90\n\n\n0.036\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n78.41\n\n\n41.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide Y\n\n\n0.055\n\n\n0.011\n\n\n99.51\n\n\n0.013\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n219.78\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide Y-\n\n\n0.667\n\n\n0.264\n\n\n8.22\n\n\n0.059\n\n\n0.029\n\n\n47.61\n\n\n5.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 45\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 40-kd pegylated peptides Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG were used as single weekly subcutaneous (s.c) injections in diet-induced obese (D10) C57B6 mice. A single injection of 325 nmol/kg of Peptide Y-PEG decreased body weight over one week by 25.8%, from 50.9±1.4 g to 37.8±0.8 g (p<0.0001, n=8/group). Comparable administration of Peptide X-PEG was effective but considerably less potent, as the decrease in body weight was 9% (49.1±1.51 g to 44.68±1.38 g). Saline-injected control mice did not change their body weight (before: 50.61±1.32 g, after: 50.87±1.46 g; \nFIG. 27A\n). The body weight changes were a result of a decrease in fat mass (41.9% for the lactam peptide, 22.2% for open form, 2.3% for controls, p<0.001; \nFIG. 27B\n) and were paralleled by a significant decrease in average daily food intake (Peptide Y-PEG: 0.40±0.29 g/day, Peptide X-PEG: 1.83±0.81 g/day, saline: 2.70±0.78 g/day, p<0.0001, \nFIG. 27C\n). Blood glucose was significantly decreased for both peptides when compared to control, and slightly more so in Peptide Y-PEG (Peptide Y-PEG: −90.1 mg/dL, Peptide X-PEG: −79.6 mg/dL, control: −23.9 g,/dL, p=0.0433; \nFIG. 27D\n). The relative difference between the two peptides (Peptide X-PEG and Peptide Y-PEG) was not statistically significant.\n\n\n \nExample 46\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a separate experiment, single s.c. injections of six different doses (0, 7, 14, 35, 70, 140 and 350 nmol/kg) of Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG demonstrated linearly responsive, dose-dependent decreases in body weight and blood glucose (\nFIGS. 28A\n, \n28\nB, \n28\nC and \n28\nD). This suggests that the observed effects are pharmacologically relevant with no apparent toxicity, other than the indirect effects of rapid, excessive loss in body weight. The magnitude of the effect was more prominent with Peptide Y-PEG and indicates that the additional element of glucagon agonism improves the potency of the peptide.\n\n\n \nExample 47\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a separate experiment, weekly s.c. injections of 70 nmol/kg of Peptide Y-PEG or Peptide X-PEG decreased body weight of DIO mice by 28.1% and 20.1%, respectively (p<0.0001, n=7-8/group; \nFIG. 29A\n). The body weight changes were associated with a decrease in fat mass (−62.9% for Peptide Y-PEG, −52.2% for Peptide X-PEG, and 5.1% for controls, p<0.0001; \nFIG. 29B\n). Long-term effects of these lower doses on food intake (p=0.95; \nFIG. 29C\n) were less impressive than short-term effects with a higher dose (\nFIG. 27C\n). Energy expenditure was increased with Peptide Y-PEG (14.60±0.69 kcal/[kg*h]) and Peptide X-PEG (17.19±1.49 kcal/[kg*h]) compared to vehicle (12.71±0.45 kcal/[kg*h]), p=0.0187), whereas the respiratory quotient tended to be decreased (\nFIGS. 29D and 29E\n; 0.719±0.01 for Peptide Y-PEG, 0.725 f 0.01 for Peptide X-PEG, and 0.755±0.01 for vehicle, p=0.1028), indicating that increased thermogenesis and altered nutrient partitioning may explain the overall negative energy balance. Increased energy expenditure was not associated with a change in spontaneous physical activity induced thermogenesis (NEAT) since locomotor activity did not differ between treatment groups and controls (p=0.4281; \nFIG. 29F\n). Neither automated online monitoring of acute feeding nor chronic monitoring of food intake revealed any differences in caloric intake (automated p=0.667, chronic p=0.9484; \nFIG. 30A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels were markedly decreased over the treatment period starting at \nDay\n 3 after the first injection (mean decrease: Peptide Y-PEG −32%, Peptide X-PEG −24.5%, controls: −2.7%, p<0.0001; \nFIG. 29G\n). In response to an intraperitoneally (i.p.) glucose challenge on \nDay\n 3, blood glucose peaks (\nFIG. 29H\n) and profiles (AUC) (\nFIG. 30F\n) were markedly lower in the two treated groups (Peptide Y-PEG 14183±1072, Peptide X-PEG 13794±824.1) compared to the vehicle-treated controls (34125±3142, p<0.0001). After one month of treatment with Peptide Y-PEG or Peptide X-PEG, plasma insulin was lower in the treatment groups (1194 pg/ml, 1034 pg/ml, p=0.0244) compared to controls (2675 pg/ml), suggesting improved insulin sensitivity (\nFIG. 29I\n). Plasma C-peptide levels tended to be decreased after one month of treatment with Peptide Y-PEG or Peptide X-PEG (738.8 pg/ml, 624.7 pg/ml) versus vehicle (1077 pg/ml) (p=0.108) (\nFIG. 30G\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine if the principal phenomenon generalizes across species, both compounds were administered to diet-induced obese rats (mean weight 777.4+/−2.1 g, dose 70 nmol/kg/week, once-a-week injection, 3-week treatment). Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG each decreased body weight (Peptide X-PEG: −11.15+/−0.88%; Peptide Y-PEG: −20.58+/−2.26%, vehicle: 1.09+/−0.56%) (p<0.0001) and fat mass of the DIO rats (Peptide X-PEG: −19.17+/−2.03%; Peptide Y-PEG: −33.76+−/−4.76%, vehicle: 0.65+/−1.20%; p<0.0001), confirming a species-independent applicability of this anti-obesity treatment approach.\n\n\n \nExample 48\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic s.c. treatment over 27 days with Peptide X-PEG and Peptide Y-PEG decreased total cholesterol in DIO mice (106.9±6.3 mg/dL and 200.8±29.58 mg/dL, respectively) relative to vehicle (254.0 25.33 mg/dL, p=0.0441; \nFIG. 31A\n). In a separate experiment, DIO mice received 70 nmol/kg s.c. of Peptide X-PEG, Peptide Y-PEG or vehicle on \n \nDays\n \n 0 and 7 and were evaluated on \nDay\n 9. Peptide Y-PEG decreased plasma triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (total cholesterol 63.0 2.49 mg/dL compared to vehicle 177.7±11.8 mg/dL) (p<0.0001), while potentially causing a switch from LDL to HDL cholesterol (\nFIG. 31B\n). Peptide X-PEG decreased both LDL and HDL cholesterol but had no significant effect on triglycerides (\nFIG. 31C\n). There was a significant decrease in leptin (3343±723.3 pg/ml for Peptide Y-PEG; 7308±2927 for Peptide X-PEG, and 18,642±6124 for vehicle; p=0.0426; \nFIG. 31D\n, \n31\nE, \n31\nF). Chronic treatment for 27 days also normalized liver lipid content while control DIO mice maintained significant liver steatosis (data not shown).\n\n\n \nExample 49\n\n\n \n \n \nOne month treatment with Peptide X-PEG or Peptide Y-PEG resulted in increased phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in white adipose tissue (WAT) of DIO mice (Peptide X-PEG: 1.135±0.315; Peptide Y-PEG: 1.625±0.149; vehicle: 0.597±0.204; p=0.0369; \nFIG. 32B\n), implying a glucagon-specific direct effect on WAT lipolysis. Concomitant with the decrease in fat mass of mice treated for two weeks at a dose of 35 nmol/kg/week with the Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG, there was a significant reduction of adipocyte size in epididymal adipose tissues when compared to control mice (data not shown). However, despite having decreased fat mass and smaller adipocytes, this short term treatment of two weeks with the Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG was not associated with a significant reduction of adipose tissue macrophage content as quantified by real-time RT-PCR for CD68 (\nFIG. 33C\n). Uncoupling protein I (UCP1) levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) were increased by Peptide X-PEG, but not by Peptide Y-PEG treatment (Peptide X-PEG 2.167±0.429, Peptide Y-PEG 1.287±0.1558, and vehicle 1.0±0.118; p=0.0264; \nFIG. 32A\n), consistent with a GLP-1-specific action on BAT resting thermogenesis. Hepatic gene expression reflective of hepatic gluconeogenesis was not affected by either Peptide X-PEG or Peptide Y-PEG (FIG. \n30\nH and \n30\nI). Histology indicated that pancreatic islets tended to be smaller following Peptide X-PEG treatment (data not shown).\n\n\n \nExample 50\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to dissect the contributions of the GLP-1R and the GcgR agonist components of Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG, each was administered for one month to GLP-1 receptor knock out (GLP-1R−/−) mice maintained on high-fat diet. Peptide X-PEG caused a reduction of body weight (p>0.05; \nFIGS. 34A and 34B\n) and fat mass (p>0.05; \nFIG. 34C\n) compared to saline. Peptide Y-PEG caused a significant decrease in body weight (p=0.0025) and fat mass (p=0.0025) in the GLP-1R−/−mice (\nFIGS. 34A-34C\n). Peptide X-PEG had no effect on food intake in GLP-1R−/−mice, while Peptide Y-PEG suppressed food intake significantly (p=0.017) (\nFIG. 34D\n). Peptide Y-PEG (but not Peptide X-PEG) had a tendency to increase blood glucose in a glucose tolerance test in the absence of a functional GLP-1R (p=0.03) (\nFIGS. 34E and 34F\n), implying that the GLP-1 component of the co-agonist is needed to protect against glucagon-induced hyperglycemia.\n\n\n \nExample 51\n\n\n \n \n \nAs an independent assessment of the effect of Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG that can be attributable to glucagon agonism, two additional peptide agonists with comparable GLP-1R potency but markedly different GcgR activity were studied. The two peptides (Peptides U and V) are related to the Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG. Peptides U and V comprised the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with the following modifications: Glu at \nposition\n 16, Gln at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at \nposition\n 20, Glu at \nposition\n 21, Ile at position 23, and Cys at \nposition\n 24, but comprised a 20-kd pegylation at the Cys at \nposition\n 24 and did not comprise AIB at \nposition\n 2. Peptide V additionally comprised a substitution of Gln3 with Glu which selectively reduced glucagon agonism by more than ten-fold. Neither Peptide U nor Peptide V comprised a lactam bridge. Treatment of DIO mice each day for one week at 50 nmol/kg s.c. with Peptide V revealed a reduced effect on body weight lowering relative to the Peptide U (−9.09±0.80 vs. −13.71±0.92 g, respectively (p<0.0001; \nFIG. 35A\n).\n\n\n \nExample 52\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides comprising a C16 fatty acyl group attached to a Lys residue via a γ-Glu spacer or a γ-Glu-γ-Glu dipeptide spacer, wherein the Lys residue is located at \nposition\n 10 or at the C-terminus (at position 29), were made as essentially described herein. The peptides were tested for in vitro activities at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors as described herein.
