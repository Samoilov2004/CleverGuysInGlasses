Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe invention relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding FGF21 mutant polypeptides, FGF21 mutant polypeptides, pharmaceutical compositions comprising FGF21 mutant polypeptides, and methods for treating metabolic disorders using such nucleic acids, polypeptides, or pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n2. Background of the Invention\n\n\nFGF21 is a secreted polypeptide that belongs to a subfamily of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that includes FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 (Itoh et al., 2004, \nTrend Genet. \n20: 563-69). FGF21 is an atypical FGF in that it is heparin independent and functions as a hormone in the regulation of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism.\n\n\nFGF21 was isolated from a liver cDNA library as a hepatic secreted factor. It is highly expressed in liver and pancreas and is the only member of the FGF family to be primarily expressed in liver. Transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 exhibit metabolic phenotypes of slow growth rate, low plasma glucose and triglyceride levels, and an absence of age-associated \ntype\n 2 diabetes, islet hyperplasia, and obesity. Pharmacological administration of recombinant FGF21 protein in rodent and primate models results in normalized levels of plasma glucose, reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, FGF21 reduces body weight and body fat by increasing energy expenditure, physical activity, and metabolic rate. Experimental research provides support for the pharmacological administration of FGF21 for the treatment of \ntype\n 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic conditions or disorders in humans.\n\n\nHuman FGF21 has a short half-life in vivo. In mice, the half-life of human FGF21 is 1 to 2 hours, and in cynomolgus monkeys, the half-life is 2.5 to 3 hours. In developing an FGF21 protein for use as a therapeutic in the treatment of \ntype\n 2 diabetes, an increase in half-life would be desirable. FGF21 proteins having an enhanced half-life would allow for less frequent dosing of patients being administered the protein. Such proteins are described herein.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present disclosure provides an isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4, further comprising the substitution of any amino acid for: the alanine residue at \nposition\n 45, the leucine residue at position 86, the leucine residue at position 98, the alanine residue at position 111, the alanine residue at position 129, the glycine residue at position 170, the proline residue at position 171 or the serine residue at position 172, and combinations thereof In one embodiment the isolated polypeptide comprises the substitution of any amino acid for: the leucine residue at position 98, the proline residue at 171 or both the leucine residue at position 98 and the proline residue at position 171.

Optionally, the half-life can be further extended by fusing an antibody, or portion thereof, to the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the wild-type FGF21 sequence. It is also possible to further extend the half-life or decrease aggregation of the wild-type FGF21 protein by introducing amino acid substitutions into the protein. Such modified proteins are referred to herein as mutants, or FGF21 mutants, and form embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\nRecombinant nucleic acid methods used herein, including in the Examples, are generally those set forth in Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) or \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology \n(Ausubel et al., eds., Green Publishers Inc. and Wiley and Sons 1994), both of which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose.\n\n\n1. General Definitions\n\n\nThe term “isolated nucleic acid molecule” refers to a nucleic acid molecule of the invention that (1) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally found when total nucleic acid is isolated from the source cells, (2) is not linked to all or a portion of a polynucleotide to which the “isolated nucleic acid molecule” is linked in nature, (3) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature as part of a larger polynucleotide sequence. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is substantially free from any other contaminating nucleic acid molecules or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its use in polypeptide production or its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic or research use.\n\n\nThe term “vector” is used to refer to any molecule (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, or virus) used to transfer coding information to a host cell.\n\n\nThe term “expression vector” refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or control the expression of inserted heterologous nucleic acid sequences. Expression includes, but is not limited to, processes such as transcription, translation, and RNA splicing, if introns are present.\n\n\nThe term “operably linked” is used herein to refer to an arrangement of flanking sequences wherein the flanking sequences so described are configured or assembled so as to perform their usual function. Thus, a flanking sequence operably linked to a coding sequence may be capable of effecting the replication, transcription and/or translation of the coding sequence. For example, a coding sequence is operably linked to a promoter when the promoter is capable of directing transcription of that coding sequence. A flanking sequence need not be contiguous with the coding sequence, so long as it functions correctly. Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet transcribed sequences can be present between a promoter sequence and the coding sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered “operably linked” to the coding sequence.\n\n\nThe term “host cell” is used to refer to a cell which has been transformed, or is capable of being transformed with a nucleic acid sequence and then of expressing a selected gene of interest. The term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up to the original parent, so long as the selected gene is present.\n\n\nThe term “isolated polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide of the present invention that (1) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally found when isolated from the source cell, (2) is not linked (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) to all or a portion of a polypeptide to which the “isolated polypeptide” is linked in nature, (3) is operably linked (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) to a polypeptide with which it is not linked in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature. Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is substantially free from any other contaminating polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic or research use.\n\n\nThe term “naturally occurring” when used in connection with biological materials such as nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature and are not manipulated by man. Similarly, “non-naturally occurring” as used herein refers to a material that is not found in nature or that has been structurally modified or synthesized by man. When used in connection with nucleotides, the term “naturally occurring” refers to the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U). When used in connection with amino acids, the term “naturally occurring” refers to the 20 amino acids alanine (A), cysteine (C), aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E), phenylalanine (F), glycine (G), histidine (H), isoleucine (I), lysine (K), leucine (L), methionine (M), asparagine (N), proline (P), glutamine (Q), arginine (R), serine (S), threonine (T), valine (V), tryptophan (W), and tyrosine (Y).\n\n\nThe term “FGF21 polypeptide” refers to a naturally-occurring wild-type polypeptide expressed in humans. For purposes of this disclosure, the term “FGF21 polypeptide” can be used interchangeably to refer to any full-length FGF21 polypeptide, e.g., SEQ ID NO:2, which consists of 209 amino acid residues and which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; any mature form of the polypeptide, e.g., SEQ ID NO:4, which consists of 181 amino acid residues and which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, and in which the 28 amino acid residues at the amino-terminal end of the full-length FGF21 polypeptide (i.e., which constitute the signal peptide) have been removed, and variants thereof.\n\n\nThe terms “FGF21 polypeptide mutant” and “FGF21 mutant” refer to an FGF21 polypeptide variant in which a naturally occurring FGF21 amino acid sequence has been modified. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, one or more amino acid substitutions, including substitutions with non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, and truncations. Thus, FGF21 polypeptide mutants include, but are not limited to, site-directed FGF21 mutants, truncated FGF21 polypeptides, proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants, aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants, FGF21 combination mutants, and FGF21 fusion proteins, as described herein. For the purpose of identifying the specific truncations and amino acid substitutions of the FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the numbering of the amino acid residues truncated or mutated corresponds to that of the mature 181-residue FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\nIn other embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least about 85 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein specific residues conferring a desirable property to the FGF21 polypeptide mutant, e.g., proteolysis-resistance, increased half life or aggregation-reducing properties and combinations thereof, have not been further modified. In other words, with the exception of residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence that have been modified in order to confer proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing, or other properties, about 15 percent of all other amino acid residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence can be modified. For example, in the FGF21 mutant Q173E, up to 15 percent of all amino acid residues other than the glutamic acid residue, which was substituted for glutamine at position 173, could be modified. In still other embodiments, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least about 90 percent, or about 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein the specific residues conferring the FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance or aggregation-reducing properties have not been further modified. Such FGF21 polypeptide mutants possess at least one activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses a nucleic acid molecule encoding an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least about 85 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein specific residues conferring a desirable property to the FGF21 polypeptide mutant, e.g., proteolysis-resistance, increased half life or aggregation-reducing properties and combinations thereof have not been further modified. In other words, with the exception of nucleotides that encode residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence that have been modified in order to confer proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing, or other properties, about 15 percent of all other nucleotides in the FGF21 mutant sequence can be modified. For example, in the FGF21 mutant Q173E, up to 15 percent of all nucleotides other than the nucleotides encoding the glutamic acid residue, which was substituted for glutamine at position 173, could be modified. The present invention further encompasses a nucleic acid molecule encoding an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least about 90 percent, or about 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein the specific residues conferring the FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance or aggregation-reducing properties have not been further modified. Such FGF21 mutants possess at least one activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence that is at least about 85 percent identical to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, but wherein the nucleotides encoding amino acid residues conferring the encoded FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing or other properties have not been further modified. In other words, with the exception of residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence that have been modified in order to confer proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing, or other properties, about 15 percent of all other amino acid residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence can be modified. For example, in the FGF21 mutant Q173E, up to 15 percent of all amino acid residues other than the glutamic acid residue, which was substituted for glutamine at position 173, could be modified. The present invention further encompasses a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence that is at least about 90 percent, or about 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent identical to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, but wherein the nucleotides encoding amino acid residues conferring the encoded FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance or aggregation-reducing properties have not been further modified. Such nucleic acid molecules encode FGF21 mutant polypeptides possessing at least one activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\nThe term “biologically active FGF21 polypeptide mutant” refers to any FGF21 polypeptide mutant described herein that possesses an activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, such as the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol; reduce body weight; and improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity, regardless of the type or number of modifications that have been introduced into the FGF21 polypeptide mutant. FGF21 polypeptide mutants possessing a somewhat decreased level of FGF21 activity relative to the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide can nonetheless be considered to be biologically active FGF21 polypeptide mutants.\n\n\nThe terms “effective amount” and “therapeutically effective amount” each refer to the amount of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant used to support an observable level of one or more biological activities of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, such as the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol levels; reduce body weight; or improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “physiologically acceptable carrier” as used herein refers to one or more formulation materials suitable for accomplishing or enhancing the delivery of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant.\n\n\nThe term “antigen” refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule that is capable of being bound by an antibody, and additionally that is capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies that are capable of binding to an epitope of that antigen. An antigen may have one or more epitopes.\n\n\nThe term “native Fc” refers to molecule or sequence comprising the sequence of a non-antigen-binding fragment resulting from digestion of whole antibody or produced by other means, whether in monomeric or multimeric form, and can contain the hinge region. The original immunoglobulin source of the native Fc is preferably of human origin and can be any of the immunoglobulins, although IgG1 and IgG2 are preferred. Native Fc molecules are made up of monomeric polypeptides that can be linked into dimeric or multimeric forms by covalent (i.e., disulfide bonds) and non-covalent association. The number of intermolecular disulfide bonds between monomeric subunits of native Fc molecules ranges from 1 to 4 depending on class (e.g., IgG, IgA, and IgE) or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgA1, and IgGA2). One example of a native Fc is a disulfide-bonded dimer resulting from papain digestion of an IgG (see Ellison et al., 1982, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n10: 4071-9). The term “native Fc” as used herein is generic to the monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric forms. An example of an Fc polypeptide sequence is presented in SEQ ID NO:13.\n\n\nThe term “Fc variant” refers to a molecule or sequence that is modified from a native Fc but still comprises a binding site for the salvage receptor, FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor). International Publication Nos. WO 97/34631 and WO 96/32478 describe exemplary Fc variants, as well as interaction with the salvage receptor, and are hereby incorporated by reference. Thus, the term “Fc variant” can comprise a molecule or sequence that is humanized from a non-human native Fc. Furthermore, a native Fc comprises regions that can be removed because they provide structural features or biological activity that are not required for the fusion molecules of the FGF21 mutants of the present invention. Thus, the term “Fc variant” comprises a molecule or sequence that lacks one or more native Fc sites or residues, or in which one or more Fc sites or residues has be modified, that affect or are involved in: (1) disulfide bond formation, (2) incompatibility with a selected host cell, (3) N-terminal heterogeneity upon expression in a selected host cell, (4) glycosylation, (5) interaction with complement, (6) binding to an Fc receptor other than a salvage receptor, or (7) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Fc variants are described in further detail hereinafter.\n\n\nThe term “Fc domain” encompasses native Fc and Fc variants and sequences as defined above. As with Fc variants and native Fc molecules, the term “Fc domain” includes molecules in monomeric or multimeric form, whether digested from whole antibody or produced by other means. In some embodiments of the present invention, an Fc domain can be fused to FGF21 or a FGF21 mutant (including a truncated form of FGF21 or a FGF21 mutant) via, for example, a covalent bond between the Fc domain and the FGF21 sequence. Such fusion proteins can form multimers via the association of the Fc domains and both these fusion proteins and their multimers are an aspect of the present invention.\n\n\n2. Site-Specific FGF21 Mutants\n\n\nThe term “site-specific FGF21 mutant” or “substituted FGF21 mutant” refers to an FGF21 mutant polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that differs from the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring FGF21 polypeptide sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:2 and 4 and variants thereof. Site-specific FGF21 mutants can be generated by introducing amino acid substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative and using naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acids, at particular positions of the FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n“Conservative amino acid substitution” can involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue (i.e., a residue found in a given position of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide sequence) with a nonnative residue (i.e., a residue that is not found in a given position of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide sequence) such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. Conservative amino acid substitutions also encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues that are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics, and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.\n\n\nNaturally occurring residues can be divided into classes based on common side chain properties:\n\n\n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n\n\n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr;\n\n\n(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n(4) basic: Asn, Gln, His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and\n\n\n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\nConservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for another member of the same class. Non-conservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class.\n\n\nDesired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired.

This embodiment of the present invention arose from an effort to identify truncated FGF21 polypeptides that are capable of providing an activity that is similar, and in some instances superior, to untruncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “truncated FGF21 polypeptide” refers to an FGF21 polypeptide in which amino acid residues have been removed from the amino-terminal (or N-terminal) end of the FGF21 polypeptide, amino acid residues have been removed from the carboxyl-terminal (or C-terminal) end of the FGF21 polypeptide, or amino acid residues have been removed from both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends of the FGF21 polypeptide. The various truncations disclosed herein were prepared as described herein Examples 3 and 6.\n\n\nThe activity of N-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides and C-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides can be assayed using an in vitro ELK-luciferase assay as described in Example 4. Specific details of the in vitro assays that can be used to examine the activity of truncated FGF21 polypeptides can be found in Example 4.\n\n\nThe activity of the truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention can also be assessed in an in vivo assay, such as ob/ob mice as shown in Examples 5 and 7. Generally, to assess the in vivo activity of a truncated FGF21 polypeptide, the truncated FGF21 polypeptide can be administered to a test animal intraperitoneally. After a desired incubation period (e.g., one hour or more), a blood sample can be drawn, and blood glucose levels can be measured. Specific details of the in vivo assays that can be used to examine the activity of truncated FGF21 polypeptides can be found in Examples 5 and 7.\n\n\na. N-Terminal Truncations\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, N-terminal truncations comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of the mature FGF21 polypeptide. As demonstrated in, for example, Example 5 and \nFIG. 3\n, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 9 amino acid residues retain the ability of the mature FGF21 polypeptide to lower blood glucose in an individual. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide or FGF21 polypeptide mutants having N-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues.\n\n\nb. C-Terminal Truncations\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, C-terminal truncations comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of the mature FGF21 polypeptide. As demonstrated in, for example, Example 4 and \nFIG. 1B\n, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues exhibited an efficacy of at least 50% of the efficacy of wild-type FGF21 in an in vitro ELK-luciferase assay, indicating that these FGF21 mutants retain the ability of the mature FGF21 polypeptide to lower blood glucose in an individual. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide or FGF21 polypeptide mutants having C-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acid residues.\n\n\nc. N-Terminal and C-Terminal Truncations\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, truncated FGF21 polypeptides can have a combination of N-terminal and C-terminal truncations. Truncated FGF21 polypeptides having a combination of N-terminal and C-terminal truncations share the activity of corresponding truncated FGF21 polypeptides having either the N-terminal or C-terminal truncations alone. In other words, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having both N-terminal truncations of fewer than 9 amino acid residues and C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues possess similar or greater blood glucose-lowering activity as truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 9 amino acid residues or truncated FGF21 polypeptides having C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide or FGF21 polypeptide mutants having both N-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues and C-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acid residues.\n\n\nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, truncated FGF21 polypeptides can optionally comprise an amino-terminal methionine residue, which can be introduced by directed mutation or as a result of a bacterial expression process.\n\n\nThe truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention can be prepared as described in Examples 3 and 6. Those of ordinary skill in the art, familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra\n, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThe truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention can also be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the truncated FGF21 polypeptide. In one embodiment of the present invention, a truncated FGF21 polypeptide can be fused to an Fc sequence. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n4. Proteolysis-Resistant FGF21 Mutants\n\n\nAs described in Example 8, mature FGF21 was found to be undergoing in vivo degradation, which was ultimately determined to arise from proteolytic attack. The in vivo degradation of mature FGF21 was found to lead to shorter effective half-life, which can adversely affect the therapeutic potential of a molecule. Accordingly, a directed study was performed to identify FGF21 mutants that exhibit a resistance to proteolysis. As a result of this investigation, the sites in the mature FGF21 polypeptide that were determined to be particularly susceptible to proteolysis include the peptide bond between the amino acid residues at positions 4-5, 20-21, 151-152, and 171-172.\n\n\nA broad but focused and directed study was performed to identify particular substitutions that eliminate the observed proteolytic effect while not affecting the activity of the protein to an unacceptable degree. Tables 8 and 11 highlight some of the mutants that were prepared and tested. As described in, for example, Examples 13 and 14, not all FGF21 mutants exhibited an ideal profile; some mutants conferred proteolysis resistance but at the cost of compromised FGF21 activity. Other mutations retained FGF21 activity but did not confer proteolysis resistance. Several mutants, including, for example, FGF21 P171G, retained a similar level of activity as wild-type FGF21 while also exhibiting resistance to proteolytic degradation.\n\n\nOne selection criteria for identifying desirable proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants was that the activity of the FGF21 mutant be essentially the same as, or greater than, the activity of wild-type FGF21. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is directed to FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis and still retain activity that is essentially the same as, or greater than, wild-type FGF21. Although less desirable in some cases, FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis but exhibit somewhat decreased activity form another embodiment of the present invention. In some cases it can be desirable to maintain a degree of proteolysis, and consequently, FGF21 mutants that allow some degree of proteolysis to occur also form another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be prepared as described herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art, for example, those familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra\n, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThe proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutant. In one embodiment of the present invention, a proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutant can be fused to an IgG Fc sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO:13. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are known and are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n5. Aggregation-Reducing FGF21 Mutants\n\n\nAs described in Example 15, one property of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide is its propensity to aggregate. At concentrations over about 5 mg/mL, the aggregation rate is high at room temperature. As shown and described herein, the aggregation rate for the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide is both concentration and temperature dependent.\n\n\nAggregation can prove to be a challenge when working with wild-type FGF21 at these concentrations, such as in the context of a therapeutic formulation. Accordingly, a directed study was performed to identify FGF21 mutants that exhibit reduced FGF21 aggregation. The resulting FGF21 mutants were then tested for the propensity to aggregate at various concentrations.\n\n\nA broad but focused and directed study was performed to identify particular substitutions that eliminate or reduce the observed aggregation effect of wild-type FGF21 while not affecting the activity of the protein to an unacceptable degree. The approach for identifying suitable aggregation-reducing mutants is described in Example 15. Table 16 highlights some of the mutants that were prepared and tested. As described in, for example, Example 17, not all FGF21 mutants exhibited an ideal profile. Some mutants, such as FGF21 L58E had compromised FGF21 activity and were not studied further. Other mutations, such as FGF21 A134E, retained FGF21 activity but did not confer reduced aggregation properties. Several mutants, such as FGF21 L98R, retained FGF21 activity and also exhibited reduced aggregation. One mutant, FGF21 A45K, surprisingly exhibited increased FGF21 activity while also exhibiting reduced aggregation properties.\n\n\nOne selection criteria for identifying desirable aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants was that the activity of the FGF21 mutant be essentially similar to, or greater than, the activity of wild-type FGF21. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is directed to FGF21 mutants having reduced aggregation properties while still retaining an FGF21 activity that is similar to, or greater than, wild-type FGF21. Although less desirable in some cases, FGF21 mutants having reduced aggregation properties but exhibiting somewhat decreased FGF21 activity form another embodiment of the present invention. In some cases it may be desirable to maintain a degree of aggregation, and consequently, FGF21 mutants that allow some degree of aggregation to occur also form another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be prepared as described herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art, familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra\n, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThe aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutant. In one embodiment of the present invention, an aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutant can be fused to an IgG Fc sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO:13. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n6. FGF21 Combination Mutants\n\n\nAs described herein, the wild-type FGF21 sequence possesses several properties that can pose significant challenges when FGF21 is used as a therapeutic molecule. Among these challenges are the protein's susceptibility to degradation and its propensity for aggregation at high concentration. After an exhaustive effort to identify FGF21 polypeptides that overcome each of these challenges, a directed study was performed to determine whether the amino acid substitutions conferring proteolysis-resistance and those conferring aggregation-reducing properties could be combined in an additive or synergistic fashion in a single polypeptide sequence while maintaining activity levels that are equal to or greater than the activity of wild-type FGF21. This represented a significant challenge, as it is known in the art that the introduction of multiple mutations in a given polypeptide can sometimes adversely affect the expression, activity, and subsequent manufacture of the protein.\n\n\nSurprisingly, as demonstrated in, for example, Examples 19 and 20, it was found that the desirable properties of several FGF21 mutants could indeed be combined in an additive or synergistic fashion to generate an FGF21 mutant having enhanced pharmaceutical properties. FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis, have a reduced rate of aggregation, and which still retain activity that is the same as, or greater than, wild-type FGF21, are disclosed herein.\n\n\nOne selection criteria for identifying desirable FGF21 combination mutants was that the activity of the FGF21 mutant be similar to, or greater than, the activity of wild-type FGF21. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is directed to FGF21 mutants that are proteolysis-resistant and have reduced aggregation properties while still retaining an FGF21 activity that is similar to, or greater than, wild-type FGF21. Although less desirable in some cases, FGF21 mutants that are proteolysis-resistant and have reduced aggregation properties but exhibit somewhat decreased FGF21 activity form another embodiment of the present invention. In some cases it may be desirable to maintain a degree of proteolysis and/or aggregation, and consequently, FGF21 mutants that allow some degree of proteolysis and/or aggregation also form another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the FGF21 combination mutants of the present invention can be prepared as described herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art, familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the FGF21 combination mutants of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra\n, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThe FGF21 combination mutants of the present invention can be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the FGF21 combination mutant. In one embodiment of the present invention, an FGF21 combination mutant can be fused to an IgG Fc sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO:13. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n7. FGF21 Fusion Proteins\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “FGF21 fusion polypeptide” or “FGF21 fusion protein” refers to a fusion of one or more amino acid residues (such as a heterologous protein or peptide) at the N-terminus or C-terminus of any FGF21 polypeptide mutant described herein.\n\n\nHeterologous peptides and polypeptides include, but are not limited to, an epitope to allow for the detection and/or isolation of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant; a transmembrane receptor protein or a portion thereof, such as an extracellular domain or a transmembrane and intracellular domain; a ligand or a portion thereof which binds to a transmembrane receptor protein; an enzyme or portion thereof which is catalytically active; a polypeptide or peptide which promotes oligomerization, such as a leucine zipper domain; a polypeptide or peptide which increases stability, such as an immunoglobulin constant region; a functional or non-functional antibody, or a heavy or light chain thereof; and a polypeptide which has an activity, such as a therapeutic activity, different from the FGF21 polypeptide mutants of the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are FGF21 mutants fused to human serum albumin (HSA).\n\n\nFGF21 fusion proteins can be made by fusing heterologous sequences at either the N-terminus or at the C-terminus of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant. As described herein, a heterologous sequence can be an amino acid sequence or a non-amino acid-containing polymer. Heterologous sequences can be fused either directly to the FGF21 polypeptide mutant or via a linker or adapter molecule. A linker or adapter molecule can be one or more amino acid residues (or -mers), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 residues (or -mers), preferably from 10 to 50 amino acid residues (or -mers), e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 residues (or -mers), and more preferably from 15 to 35 amino acid residues (or -mers). A linker or adapter molecule can also be designed with a cleavage site for a DNA restriction endonuclease or for a protease to allow for the separation of the fused moieties.\n\n\na. Fc Fusions\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant is fused to one or more domains of an Fc region of human IgG. Antibodies comprise two functionally independent parts, a variable domain known as “Fab,” that binds an antigen, and a constant domain known as “Fc,” that is involved in effector functions such as complement activation and attack by phagocytic cells. An Fc has a long serum half-life, whereas a Fab is short-lived (Capon et al., 1989, \nNature \n337: 525-31). When joined together with a therapeutic protein, an Fc domain can provide longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, protein A binding, complement fixation, and perhaps even placental transfer (Capon et al., 1989).\n\n\nIn vivo pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that human FGF21 has a short half-life of about 1 hour in mice due to rapid clearance and in vivo degradation. Therefore, to extend the half-life of FGF21 an Fc sequence was fused to the N- or C-terminal end of the FGF21 polypeptide. The fusion of an Fc region to wild type FGF21, in particularly Fc fused to the N-terminus of wild type FGF21, did not extend the half-life as expected, however, which led to an investigation of the proteolytic degradation of FGF21 in vivo and the identification of FGF21 mutants that were resistant to such degradation. Such mutants are described in, for example, Examples 8 and 11, and exhibit longer half-lives than wild-type FGF21. These and other FGF21 fusion proteins form embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\nThroughout the disclosure, Fc-FGF21 refers to a fusion protein in which the Fc sequence is fused to the N-terminus of FGF21. Similarly, throughout the disclosure, FGF21-Fc refers to a fusion protein in which the Fc sequence is fused to the C-terminus of FGF21.\n\n\nThe resulting FGF21 fusion protein can be purified, for example, by the use of a Protein A affinity column. Peptides and proteins fused to an Fc region have been found to exhibit a substantially greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart. Also, a fusion to an Fc region allows for dimerization/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide. The Fc region can be a naturally occurring Fc region, or can be altered to improve certain qualities, such as therapeutic qualities, circulation time, or reduced aggregation.\n\n\nUseful modifications of protein therapeutic agents by fusion with the “Fc” domain of an antibody are discussed in detail in International Publication No. WO 00/024782, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This document discusses linkage to a “vehicle” such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran, or an Fc region.\n\n\nb. Fusion Protein Linkers\n\n\nWhen forming the fusion proteins of the present invention, a linker can, but need not, be employed. When present, the linker's chemical structure may not critical, since it serves primarily as a spacer. The linker can be made up of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. In some embodiments of the present invention, the linker is made up of from 1 to 20 amino acids linked by peptide bonds, wherein the amino acids are selected from the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. In various embodiments, the 1 to 20 amino acids are selected from the amino acids glycine, serine, alanine, proline, asparagine, glutamine, and lysine. In some embodiments, a linker is made up of a majority of amino acids that are sterically unhindered, such as glycine and alanine. In some embodiments, linkers are polyglycines (such as (Gly)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO:29) and (Gly)\n5 \n(SEQ ID NO:30)), polyalanines, combinations of glycine and alanine (such as poly(Gly-Ala)), or combinations of glycine and serine (such as poly(Gly-Ser)). Other suitable linkers include: (Gly)\n5\n-Ser-(Gly)\n3\n-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser (SEQ ID NO:23), (Gly)\n4\n-Ser-(Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser (SEQ ID NO:31), (Gly)\n3\n-Lys-(Gly)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO:32), (Gly)\n3\n-Asn-Gly-Ser-(Gly)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:33), (Gly)\n3\n-Cys-(Gly)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO:34), and Gly-Pro-Asn-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:35). While a linker of 15 amino acid residues has been found to work particularly well for FGF21 fusion proteins, the present invention contemplates linkers of any length or composition.\n\n\nThe linkers described herein are exemplary, and linkers that are much longer and which include other residues are contemplated by the present invention. Non-peptide linkers are also contemplated by the present invention. For example, alkyl linkers such as —NH—(CH\n2\n)\nS\n—C(O)—, wherein s=2 to 20, could be used. These alkyl linkers can further be substituted by any non-sterically hindering group, including, but not limited to, a lower alkyl (e.g., C1-C6), lower acyl, halogen (e.g., Cl, Br), CN, NH\n2\n, or phenyl. An exemplary non-peptide linker is a polyethylene glycol linker, wherein the linker has a molecular weight of 100 to 5000 kD, for example, 100 to 500 kD.\n\n\n8. Chemically-Modified FGF21 Mutants\n\n\nChemically modified forms of the FGF21 polypeptide mutants described herein, including the truncated forms of FGF21 described herein, can be prepared by one skilled in the art, given the disclosures described herein. Such chemically modified FGF21 mutants are altered such that the chemically modified FGF21 mutant is different from the unmodified FGF21 mutant, either in the type or location of the molecules naturally attached to the FGF21 mutant. Chemically modified FGF21 mutants can include molecules formed by the deletion of one or more naturally-attached chemical groups.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, FGF21 polypeptide mutants of the present invention can be modified by the covalent attachment of one or more polymers. For example, the polymer selected is typically water-soluble so that the protein to which it is attached does not precipitate in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological environment. Included within the scope of suitable polymers is a mixture of polymers. Preferably, for therapeutic use of the end-product preparation, the polymer will be pharmaceutically acceptable. Non-water soluble polymers conjugated to FGF21 polypeptide mutants of the present invention also form an aspect of the invention.\n\n\nExemplary polymers each can be of any molecular weight and can be branched or unbranched. The polymers each typically have an average molecular weight of between about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa (the term “about” indicating that in preparations of a water-soluble polymer, some molecules will weigh more and some less than the stated molecular weight). The average molecular weight of each polymer is preferably between about 5 kDa and about 50 kDa, more preferably between about 12 kDa and about 40 kDa, and most preferably between about 20 kDa and about 35 kDa.\n\n\nSuitable water-soluble polymers or mixtures thereof include, but are not limited to, N-linked or O-linked carbohydrates, sugars, phosphates, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (including the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize proteins, including mono-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n), alkoxy-, or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol), monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran (such as low molecular weight dextran of, for example, about 6 kD), cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), and polyvinyl alcohol. Also encompassed by the present invention are bifunctional crosslinking molecules that can be used to prepare covalently attached FGF21 polypeptide mutant multimers. Also encompassed by the present invention are FGF21 mutants covalently attached to polysialic acid.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 mutant is covalently, or chemically, modified to include one or more water-soluble polymers, including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337. In some embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 mutant comprises one or more polymers, including, but not limited to, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, another carbohydrate-based polymer, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, or mixtures of such polymers.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 mutant is covalently-modified with PEG subunits. In some embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymers are bonded at one or more specific positions (for example, at the N-terminus) of the FGF21 mutant. In some embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymers are randomly attached to one or more side chains of an FGF21 mutant. In some embodiments, PEG is used to improve the therapeutic capacity of an FGF21 mutant. Certain such methods are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,426, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.\n\n\nIn embodiments of the present invention wherein the polymer is PEG, the PEG group can be of any convenient molecular weight, and can be linear or branched. The average molecular weight of the PEG group will preferably range from about 2 kD to about 100 kDa, and more preferably from about 5 kDa to about 50 kDa, e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 kDa. The PEG groups will generally be attached to the FGF21 mutant via acylation or reductive alkylation through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, thiol, or ester group) to a reactive group on the FGF21 mutant (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, or ester group).\n\n\nThe PEGylation of a polypeptide, including the FGF21 mutants of the present invention, can be specifically carried out using any of the PEGylation reactions known in the art. Such reactions are described, for example, in the following references: Francis et al., 1992, \nFocus on Growth Factors \n3: 4-10; European Patent Nos. 0 154 316 and 0 401 384; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337. For example, PEGylation can be carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer) as described herein. For the acylation reactions, a selected polymer should have a single reactive ester group. For reductive alkylation, a selected polymer should have a single reactive aldehyde group. A reactive aldehyde is, for example, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, which is water stable, or mono C\n1\n-C\n10 \nalkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,714).\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, a useful strategy for the attachment of the PEG group to a polypeptide involves combining, through the formation of a conjugate linkage in solution, a peptide and a PEG moiety, each bearing a special functionality that is mutually reactive toward the other. The peptides can be easily prepared with conventional solid phase synthesis. The peptides are “preactivated” with an appropriate functional group at a specific site. The precursors are purified and fully characterized prior to reacting with the PEG moiety. Ligation of the peptide with PEG usually takes place in aqueous phase and can be easily monitored by reverse phase analytical HPLC. The PEGylated peptides can be easily purified by preparative HPLC and characterized by analytical HPLC, amino acid analysis and laser desorption mass spectrometry.\n\n\nPolysaccharide polymers are another type of water-soluble polymer that can be used for protein modification. Therefore, the FGF21 mutants of the present invention fused to a polysaccharide polymer form embodiments of the present invention. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers comprised of individual subunits of glucose predominantly linked by alpha 1-6 linkages. The dextran itself is available in many molecular weight ranges, and is readily available in molecular weights from about 1 kD to about 70 kD. Dextran is a suitable water-soluble polymer for use as a vehicle by itself or in combination with another vehicle (e.g., Fc). See, e.g., International Publication No. WO 96/11953. The use of dextran conjugated to therapeutic or diagnostic immunoglobulins has been reported. See, e.g., European Patent Publication No. 0 315 456, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention also encompasses the use of dextran of about 1 kD to about 20 kD.\n\n\nIn general, chemical modification can be performed under any suitable condition used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Methods for preparing chemically modified polypeptides will generally comprise the steps of: (a) reacting the polypeptide with the activated polymer molecule (such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of the polymer molecule) under conditions whereby a FGF21 polypeptide mutant becomes attached to one or more polymer molecules, and (b) obtaining the reaction products. The optimal reaction conditions will be determined based on known parameters and the desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of polymer molecules to protein, the greater the percentage of attached polymer molecule. In one embodiment of the present invention, chemically modified FGF21 mutants can have a single polymer molecule moiety at the amino-terminus (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,784)\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention, FGF21 polypeptide mutants can be chemically coupled to biotin. The biotin/FGF21 polypeptide mutants are then allowed to bind to avidin, resulting in tetravalent avidin/biotin/FGF21 polypeptide mutants. FGF21 polypeptide mutants can also be covalently coupled to dinitrophenol (DNP) or trinitrophenol (TNP) and the resulting conjugates precipitated with anti-DNP or anti-TNP-IgM to form decameric conjugates with a valency of 10.\n\n\nGenerally, conditions that can be alleviated or modulated by the administration of the present chemically modified FGF21 mutants include those described herein for FGF21 polypeptide mutants. However, the chemically modified FGF21 mutants disclosed herein can have additional activities, enhanced or reduced biological activity, or other characteristics, such as increased or decreased half-life, as compared to unmodified FGF21 mutants.\n\n\n9. Therapeutic Compositions of FGF21 Mutants and Administration Thereof\n\n\nTherapeutic compositions comprising FGF21 mutants are within the scope of the present invention, and are specifically contemplated in light of the identification of several mutant FGF21 sequences exhibiting enhanced properties. Such FGF21 mutant pharmaceutical compositions can comprise a therapeutically effective amount of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant in admixture with a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable formulation agent selected for suitability with the mode of administration.\n\n\nAcceptable formulation materials preferably are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition can contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining, or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption, or penetration of the composition. Suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, or lysine), antimicrobials, antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite, or sodium hydrogen-sulfite), buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates, or other organic acids), bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine), chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)), complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin, or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin), fillers, monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose, or dextrins), proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins), coloring, flavoring and diluting agents, emulsifying agents, hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone), low molecular weight polypeptides, salt-forming counterions (such as sodium), preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid, or hydrogen peroxide), solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol), sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol), suspending agents, surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics; PEG; sorbitan esters; polysorbates such as polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80; triton; tromethamine; lecithin; cholesterol or tyloxapal), stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose or sorbitol), tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides—preferably sodium or potassium chloride—or mannitol sorbitol), delivery vehicles, diluents, excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants (see, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(18th Ed., A. R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company 1990), and subsequent editions of the same, incorporated herein by reference for any purpose).\n\n\nThe optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by a skilled artisan depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format, and desired dosage (see, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra\n). Such compositions can influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the FGF21 polypeptide mutant.\n\n\nThe primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition can be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier for injection can be water, physiological saline solution, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which can further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute. In one embodiment of the present invention, FGF21 polypeptide mutant compositions can be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra\n) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, the FGF21 polypeptide mutant product can be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.\n\n\nThe FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions can be selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. The preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.\n\n\nThe formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. For example, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.\n\n\nWhen parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for use in this invention can be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable, aqueous solution comprising the desired FGF21 polypeptide mutant in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which an FGF21 polypeptide mutant is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. Yet another preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that provides for the controlled or sustained release of the product which can then be delivered via a depot injection. Hyaluronic acid can also be used, and this can have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Other suitable means for the introduction of the desired molecule include implantable drug delivery devices.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for inhalation. For example, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant can be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. FGF21 polypeptide mutant inhalation solutions can also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In yet another embodiment, solutions can be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in International Publication No. WO 94/20069, which describes the pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.\n\n\nIt is also contemplated that certain formulations can be administered orally. In one embodiment of the present invention, FGF21 polypeptide mutants that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. For example, a capsule can be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the FGF21 polypeptide mutant. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders can also be employed.\n\n\nAnother pharmaceutical composition can involve an effective quantity of FGF21 polypeptide mutants in a mixture with non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit-dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.\n\n\nAdditional FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving FGF21 polypeptide mutants in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 93/15722, which describes the controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions, and Wischke & Schwendeman, 2008, \nInt. J Pharm. \n364: 298-327, and Freiberg & Zhu, 2004, \nInt. J Pharm. \n282: 1-18, which discuss microsphere/microparticle preparation and use).\n\n\nAdditional examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices can include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and European Patent No. 0 058 481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 1983, \nBiopolymers \n22: 547-56), poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., 1981, \nJ. Biomed. Mater. Res. \n15: 167-277 and Langer, 1982, \nChem. Tech. \n12: 98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-D(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent No. 0 133 988). Sustained-release compositions can also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See, e.g., Epstein et al., 1985, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n82: 3688-92; and European Patent Nos. 0 036 676, 0 088 046, and 0 143 949.\n\n\nThe FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically must be sterile. This can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method can be conducted either prior to, or following, lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In addition, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\nOnce the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations can be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) requiring reconstitution prior to administration.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits can each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. Also included within the scope of this invention are kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes).\n\n\nThe effective amount of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the FGF21 polypeptide mutant is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface, or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the patient. Accordingly, the clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage can range from about 0.1 μg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage can range from 0.1 μg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 μg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg, 15 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, 25 μg/kg, 30 μg/kg, 35 μg/kg, 40 μg/kg, 45 μg/kg, 50 μg/kg, 55 μg/kg, 60 μg/kg, 65 μg/kg, 70 μg/kg, 75 μg/kg, up to about 100 mg/kg. In yet other embodiments, the dosage can be 50 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 150 μg/kg, 200 μg/kg, 250 μg/kg, 300 μg/kg, 350 μg/kg, 400 μg/kg, 450 μg/kg, 500 μg/kg, 550 μg/kg, 600 μg/kg, 650 μg/kg, 700 μg/kg, 750 μg/kg, 800 μg/kg, 850 μg/kg, 900 μg/kg, 950 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 200 μg/kg, 300 μg/kg, 400 μg/kg, 500 μg/kg, 600 μg/kg, 700 μg/kg, 800 μg/kg, 900 μg/kg, 1000 μg/kg, 2000 μg/kg, 3000 μg/kg, 4000 μg/kg, 5000 μg/kg, 6000 μg/kg, 7000 μg/kg, 8000 μg/kg, 9000 μg/kg or 10 mg/kg.\n\n\nThe frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharnacokinetic parameters of the FGF21 polypeptide mutant in the formulation being used. Typically, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition can therefore be administered as a single dose, as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. Appropriate dosages can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.\n\n\nThe route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g., orally; through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intraparenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems (which may also be injected); or by implantation devices. Where desired, the compositions can be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.\n\n\nAlternatively or additionally, the composition can be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or other appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.\n\n\n10. Therapeutic Uses of FGF21 Polypeptide Mutants\n\n\nFGF21 polypeptide mutants can be used to treat, diagnose, ameliorate, or prevent a number of diseases, disorders, or conditions, including, but not limited to metabolic disorders. In one embodiment, the metabolic disorder to be treated is diabetes, e.g., \ntype\n 2 diabetes. In another embodiment, the metabolic disorder is obesity. Other embodiments include metabolic conditions or disorders such as dyslipidimia; hypertension; hepatosteaotosis, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis; and aging.\n\n\nIn application, a disorder or condition such as diabetes or obesity can be treated by administering an FGF21 polypeptide mutant as described herein to a patient in need thereof in the amount of a therapeutically effective dose. The administration can be performed as described herein, such as by IV injection, intraperitoneal injection, intramuscular injection, or orally in the form of a tablet or liquid formation. In most situations, a desired dosage can be determined by a clinician, as described herein, and can represent a therapeutically effective dose of the FGF21 mutant polypeptide. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that a therapeutically effective dose of FGF21 mutant polypeptide will depend, inter alia, upon the administration schedule, the unit dose of antigen administered, whether the nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, the immune status and the health of the recipient. The term “therapeutically effective dose,” as used herein, means that amount of FGF21 mutant polypeptide that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal, or human being sought by a researcher, medical doctor, or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.\n\n\n11. Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind to the FGF21 mutant polypeptides of the present invention but do not specifically bind to wild-type FGF21 polypeptides are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention. The antibodies can be polyclonal, including monospecific polyclonal; monoclonal (MAbs); recombinant; chimeric; humanized, such as complementarity-determining region (CDR)-grafted; human; single chain; and/or bispecific; as well as fragments; variants; or chemically modified molecules thereof. Antibody fragments include those portions of the antibody that specifically bind to an epitope on an FGF21 mutant polypeptide. Examples of such fragments include Fab and F(ab′) fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage of full-length antibodies. Other binding fragments include those generated by recombinant DNA techniques, such as the expression of recombinant plasmids containing nucleic acid sequences encoding antibody variable regions.\n\n\nPolyclonal antibodies directed toward an FGF21 mutant polypeptide generally are produced in animals (e.g., rabbits or mice) by means of multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the FGF21 mutant polypeptide and an adjuvant. It can be useful to conjugate an FGF21 mutant polypeptide to a carrier protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum, albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are used to enhance the immune response. After immunization, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti-FGF21 mutant antibody titer.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies directed toward FGF21 mutant polypeptides can be produced using any method that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Examples of suitable methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma methods of Kohler et al., 1975, \nNature \n256: 495-97 and the human B-cell hybridoma method (Kozbor, 1984, \nJ. Immunol. \n133: 3001; Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications \n51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1987). Also provided by the invention are hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies reactive with FGF21 mutant polypeptides.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies of the invention can be modified for use as therapeutics. In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is a “chimeric” antibody in which a portion of the heavy (H) and/or light (L) chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., 1985, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A. \n81: 6851-55.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a monoclonal antibody of the invention is a “humanized” antibody. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089 and 5,693,762. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human. Humanization can be performed, for example, using methods described in the art (see, e.g., Jones et al., 1986, \nNature \n321: 522-25; Riechmann et al., 1998, \nNature \n332: 323-27; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, \nScience \n239: 1534-36), by substituting at least a portion of a rodent complementarity-determining region for the corresponding regions of a human antibody.\n\n\nAlso encompassed by the invention are human antibodies that bind the FGF21 mutant polypeptides of the present invention. Using transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production such antibodies are produced by immunization with an FGF21 mutant antigen (i.e., having at least 6 contiguous amino acids), optionally conjugated to a carrier. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., 1993, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90: 2551-55; Jakobovits et al., 1993, \nNature \n362: 255-58; Bruggermann et al., 1993, \nYear in Immuno. \n7: 33. In one method, such transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous loci encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein, and inserting loci encoding human heavy and light chain proteins into the genome thereof. Partially modified animals, i.e., animals having less than the full complement of modifications, are then cross-bred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen, these transgenic animals produce antibodies with human (rather than, e.g., murine) amino acid sequences, including variable regions that are immunospecific for these antigens. See, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 96/33735 and WO 94/02602. Additional methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807, International Publication Nos. WO 91/10741 and WO 90/04036, and in European Patent No. 0 546 073. Human antibodies can also be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells as described herein.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, human antibodies can also be produced from phage-display libraries (see, e.g., Hoogenboom et al., 1991, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227: 381; Marks et al., 1991, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581). These processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to an antigen of choice. One such technique is described in International Publication No. WO 99/10494, which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibodies for MPL- and msk-receptors using such an approach.\n\n\nChimeric, CDR grafted, and humanized antibodies are typically produced by recombinant methods. Nucleic acids encoding the antibodies are introduced into host cells and expressed using materials and procedures described herein. In one embodiment, the antibodies are produced in mammalian host cells, such as CHO cells. Monoclonal (e.g., human) antibodies can be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells as described herein.\n\n\nThe anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies of the invention can be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays (see, e.g., Sola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques \n147-158 (CRC Press, Inc., 1987), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) for the detection and quantitation of FGF21 mutant polypeptides. The antibodies will bind FGF21 mutant polypeptides with an affinity that is appropriate for the assay method being employed.\n\n\nFor diagnostic applications, in certain embodiments, anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any one that is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety can be a radioisotope, such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n125\nI, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, or \n67\nGa; a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, or horseradish peroxidase (Bayer et al., 1990, \nMeth. Enz. \n184: 138-63).\n\n\nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard (e.g., an FGF21 mutant polypeptide, or an immunologically reactive portion thereof) to compete with the test sample analyte (e.g., an FGF21 mutant polypeptide) for binding with a limited amount of anti-FGF21 mutant antibody. The amount of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies typically are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyte that are bound to the antibodies can conveniently be separated from the standard and analyte that remain unbound.\n\n\nSandwich assays typically involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected and/or quantitated. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is typically bound by a first antibody that is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody can itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or can be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assays). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\nThe anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies of the present invention are also useful for in vivo imaging. An antibody labeled with a detectable moiety can be administered to an animal, preferably into the bloodstream, and the presence and location of the labeled antibody in the host assayed. The antibody can be labeled with any moiety that is detectable in an animal, whether by nuclear magnetic resonance, radiology, or other detection means known in the art.\n\n\nThe FGF21 mutant antibodies of the invention can be used as therapeutics. These therapeutic agents are generally agonists or antagonists, in that they either enhance or reduce, respectively, at least one of the biological activities of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide. In one embodiment, antagonist antibodies of the invention are antibodies or binding fragments thereof which are capable of specifically binding to an FGF21 mutant polypeptide and which are capable of inhibiting or eliminating the functional activity of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody will inhibit the functional activity of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide by at least about 50%, and preferably by at least about 80%. In another embodiment, the anti-FGF21 mutant antibody is capable of interfering with the interaction between an FGF21 mutant polypeptide and an FGF receptor thereby inhibiting or eliminating FGF21 mutant polypeptide activity in vitro or in vivo. Agonist and antagonist anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies are identified by screening assays that are well known in the art.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to a kit comprising FGF21 mutant antibodies and other reagents useful for detecting FGF21 mutant polypeptide levels in biological samples.

They are set forth for explanatory purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of FGF21 Expression Constructs\n\n\nA nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature FGF21 polypeptide was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers having nucleotide sequences corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mature FGF21 sequence. Table 2 lists the primers that were used to amplify the mature FGF21 sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCR Primers for Preparing FGF21 Construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nID NO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-AGGAGGAATAACATATGCATCCAATTCCAGATTCTTCTCC-3′\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntisense\n \n\n\n5′-TAGTGAGCTCGAATTCTTAGGAAGCGTAGCTGG-3′\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primers used to prepare the FGF21 expression construct incorporated restriction endonuclease sites for directional cloning of the sequence into a suitable expression vector (e.g., pET30 (Novagen/EMD Biosciences; San Diego, Calif.) or pAMG33 (Amgen; Thousand Oaks, Calif.)). The expression vector pAMG33 contains a low-copy number R-100 origin of replication, a modified lac promoter, and a kanamycin-resistance gene. The expression vector pET30 contains a pBR322-derived origin of replication, an inducible T7 promoter, and a kanamycin-resistance gene. While expression from pAMG33 was found to be higher, pET30 was found to be a more reliable cloning vector. Thus, the majority of the constructs described in the instant application were first generated in pET30 and then screened for efficacy. Selected sequences were then transferred to pAMG33 for further amplification.\n\n\nThe FGF21 sequence was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 40.65 μL dH\n2\nO, 5 μL PfuUltra II Reaction Buffer (10×), 1.25 μL dNTP Mix (40 mM-4×10 mM), 0.1 μL Template (100 ng/mL), 1 μL Primer1 (10 μM), 1 μL Primer2 (10 μM), and 1 μL PfuUltra II fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.). Amplification reactions were performed by heating for 2 minutes at 95° C.; followed by ten cycles at 95° C. for 20 seconds, 60° C. for 20 seconds (with an additional 1° C. subtracted per cycle), and 72° C. for 15 seconds/kilobase of desired product; followed by 20 cycles at 94° C. for 20 seconds, 55° C. for 20 seconds, and 72° C. for 15 seconds/kilobase of desired product; followed by 72° C. for 3 minutes. Amplification products were digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI, DpnI, and EcoRI; ligated into a suitable vector; and then transformed into competent cells.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPurification of FGF21 Proteins from Bacteria\n\n\nIn the Examples that follow, various FGF21 proteins, including the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, truncated FGF21 polypeptides, FGF21 mutants, and FGF21 fusion proteins, were expressed in a bacterial expression system. After expression, which is described below, the FGF21 proteins were purified as described in this Example, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nTo purify the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, truncated FGF21 polypeptides, and FGF21 mutants from bacterial inclusion bodies, double-washed inclusion bodies (DWIBs) were solubilized in a solubilization buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride and DTT in Tris buffer at pH 8.5 and then mixed for one hour at room temperature, and the solubilization mixture was added to a refold buffer containing urea, arginine, cysteine, and cystamine hydrochloride at pH 9.5 and then mixed for 24 hours at 5° C. (see, e.g., Clarke, 1998, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n9: 157-63; Mannall et al., 2007, \nBiotechnol. Bioeng. \n97: 1523-34; Rudolph et al., 1997, “Folding proteins,” Protein Function: A Practical Approach (Creighton, ed., New York, IRL Press) 57-99; and Ishibashi et al., 2005, \nProtein Expr. Purif. \n42: 1-6).\n\n\nFollowing solubilization and refolding, the mixture was filtered through a 0.45 micron filter. The refold pool was then concentrated approximately 10-fold with a 10 kD molecular weight cut-off Pall Omega cassette at a transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 20 psi, and dialfiltered with 3 column volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 at a TMP of 20 psi.\n\n\nThe clarified sample was then subjected to anion exchange (AEX) 5 chromatography using a Q Sepharose HP resin. A linear salt gradient of 0 to 250 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris was run at pH 8.0 at 5° C. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled.\n\n\nThe AEX eluate pool was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using a Phenyl Sepharose HP resin. Protein was eluted using a decreasing linear gradient of 0.7 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate at pH 8.0 and ambient temperature. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970, \nNature \n227: 680-85) and pooled.\n\n\nThe HIC pool was concentrated with a 10 kD molecular weight cut-off Pall Omega 0.2 m\n2 \ncassette to 7 mg/mL at a TMP of 20 psi. The concentrate was dialfiltered with 5 column volumes of 10 mM KPO\n4\n, 5% sorbitol, pH 8.0 at a TMP of 20 psi, and the recovered concentrate was diluted to 5 mg/mL. Finally, the solution was filtered through a Pall mini-Kleenpac 0.2 μM Posidyne membrane.\n\n\nTo purify FGF21 fusion proteins and FGF21 fusion mutant proteins from bacterial inclusion bodies, double-washed inclusion bodies (DWIBs) were solubilized in a solubilization buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride and DTT in Tris buffer at pH 8.5 and then mixed for one hour at room temperature, and the solubilization mixture was added to a refold buffer containing urea, arginine, cysteine, and cystamine hydrochloride at pH 9.5 and then mixed for 24 hours at 5° C. (see, e.g., Clarke, 1998, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n9: 157-63; Mannall et al., 2007, \nBiotechnol.

Purif \n42: 1-6).\n\n\nFollowing solubilization and refolding, the mixture was dialyzed against 5 volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 using 10 kD dialysis tubing. The pH of the dialyzed refold was adjusted to 5.0 with 50% acetic acid, and then clarified by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 4K.\n\n\nThe clarified sample was then subjected to anion exchange (AEX) chromatography using a Q Sepharose HP resin. A linear salt gradient of 0 to 250 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris was run at pH 8.0 at 5° C. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970, \nNature \n227: 680-85) and pooled.\n\n\nThe AEX eluate pool was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using a Phenyl Sepharose HP resin. Protein was eluted using a decreasing linear gradient of 0.6 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate at pH 8.0 at ambient temperature. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled.\n\n\nFollowing the HIC step, the pool was then dialyzed 60 volumes of 10 mM Tris, 2.2% sucrose, 3.3% sorbitol, pH 8.5. The dialyzed pool was concentrated to 5 mg/mL using a jumbosep. Finally, the solution was filtered through a Pall mini-Kleenpac 0.2 μM Posidyne membrane.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nPreparation and Expression of Truncated FGF21 Proteins\n\n\nConstructs encoding the truncated FGF21 proteins listed in Table 3 were prepared by PCR amplification of the wild-type FGF21 expression vector as described below (the construction of the wild-type FGF21 expression vector is described in Example 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\nResidues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidues\n\n\nTruncated*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-180\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-179\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-178\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-177\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-176\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-175\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-174\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-173\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-172\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-171\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-169\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-168\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-167\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-166\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-165\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-164\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-160\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-156\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-152\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-149\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-113\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2-181\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3-181\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4-181\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5-181\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6-181\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7-181\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8-181\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9-181\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC- and N-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5-174\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7-172\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9-169\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9-149\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15-169 \n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15-149 \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15-113 \n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*relative to mature FGF21 polypeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruncated FGF21 protein constructs were prepared using primers having sequences that are homologous to regions upstream and downstream of a codon (or codons) to be deleted (resulting in the truncation).

Amplification products were digested with the restriction endonuclease DpnI, and then transformed into competent cells. The resulting clones were sequenced to confirm the absence of polymerase-generated errors.\n\n\nTruncated FGF21 proteins were expressed by transforming competent BL21 (DE3) or BL21 Star (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.) cells with the construct encoding a particular truncated FGF21 protein. Transformants were grown overnight with limited aeration in TB media supplemented with 40 μg/mL kanamycin, were aerated the next morning, and after a short recovery period, were induced in 0.4 mM IPTG. FGF21 mutants were harvested by centrifugation 18-20 hours after induction.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nIn Vitro Activity of Truncated FGF21 Proteins\n\n\nExperiments were performed to identify truncated FGF21 proteins that retain wild-type FGF21 activity in an ELK-luciferase in vitro assay. Table 5 summarizes the results obtained for FGF21 proteins having truncations at the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or at both the N-terminus and C-terminus. ELK-luciferase assays were performed using a recombinant human 293T kidney cell system, in which the 293T cells overexpress beta-klotho and luciferase reporter constructs. These constructs also contain sequences encoding GAL4-ELK1 and 5xUAS-Luc, a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter containing five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site. Beta-klotho is a co-receptor that is required by FGF21 for activation of its FGF receptors and induction of intracellular signal transduction, which in turn leads to Erk and ELK phosphorylation. Luciferase activity is regulated by the level of phosphorylated Erk/ELK1, and is used to indirectly monitor and quantify FGF21 activity.\n\n\nELK-luciferase assays were performed by culturing the 293T cells in the presence of different concentrations of wild-type FGF21 or FGF21 mutant polypeptide for 6 hours, and then assaying the cell lysates for luciferase activity. \nFIGS. 1A-1B\n show the results of an ELK-luciferase activity assay performed on the FGF21 truncation mutants 7-181 and 8-181 (\nFIG. 1A\n) and the FGF21 truncation mutants 1-172, 1-171, 1-169, and 1-164 (\nFIG. 1B\n). The luminescence obtained in ELK-luciferase assays for each of the FGF21 truncation mutants 3-181, 4-181, 5-181, 7-181, 8-181, 1-180, 1-178, 1-177, 1-176, 1-175, 1-174, 1-173, 1-172, 9-181, and 1-149 is shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\nFGF21 mutant polypeptides were compared with a wild-type FGF21 standard and mutants showing an efficacy of at least 50% of the efficacy of wild-type FGF21 were considered as having not lost FGF21 activity and were assigned a “+” in Table 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruncated FGF21 Proteins: in vitro Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid Residues\n\n\nEfficacy\n\n\nActivity (+/−)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-180\n\n\n 93.2%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-178\n\n\n 95.0%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-177\n\n\n112.0%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-176\n\n\n104.8%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-174\n\n\n104.6%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-173\n\n\n 96.1%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-172\n\n\n 97.5%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-171\n\n\n113.0%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-169\n\n\n 84.9%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-167\n\n\n  20%\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-166\n\n\n  20%\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-165\n\n\n  10%\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-181\n\n\n112.5%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3-181\n\n\n130.3%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-181\n\n\n117.0%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-181\n\n\n119.6%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\n 74.2%\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8-181\n\n\n 24.9%\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9-181\n\n\n 12.5%\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectively, the results presented in Table 5 indicate that C-terminal deletions of 14 or more amino acid residues (i.e., a C-terminally truncated FGF21 protein consisting of amino acid residues 1-167 and shorter proteins) eliminate the activity of FGF21. In addition, Table 5 indicates that N-terminal deletions of 7 or more amino acid residues (i.e., an N-terminally truncated FGF21 protein consisting of amino acid residues 8-181 and shorter proteins) eliminate the activity of FGF21. Not surprisingly, truncated FGF21 proteins possessing both an N-terminal truncation of 8 to 14 residues and a C-terminal truncation of 12 or 32 residues were found to lack activity in ELK-luciferase assays.\n\n\nConsistent with the data presented in Table 5, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 7 amino acid residues constitute embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues constitute embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nIn Vivo Activity of Truncated FGF21 Proteins\n\n\nFGF21 possesses a number of biological activities, including the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol levels; reduce body weight; or improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity. Truncated FGF21 polypeptides were further analyzed for in vivo FGF21 activity, by introducing the truncated FGF21 polypeptides into insulin resistant ob/ob mice, and measuring the ability of a particular truncated FGF21 polypeptide to lower blood glucose. The truncated FGF21 polypeptide to be tested was injected intraperitoneally into an 8 week old ob/ob mouse (Jackson Laboratory), and blood samples were obtained at various time points following a single injection, e.g., 0, 6, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours after injection. Blood glucose levels were measured with a OneTouch Glucometer (LifeScan, Inc. Milpitas, Calif.), and the results expressed as a percent change of blood glucose relative to the baseline level of blood glucose (i.e., at time 0).\n\n\nThe results of one experiment are provided in \nFIG. 3\n, which shows the amount of blood glucose detected in mice injected with the FGF21 truncation mutants 8-181 and 9-181. This experiment demonstrated that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 8-181 exhibit blood glucose lowering activity in vivo however the activity is slightly less than the activity of wild-type FGF21 at 3 and 6 hours after injection, but that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 9-181 do not exhibit such activity. Thus, the in vivo analysis of truncated FGF21 polypeptides indicated that the deletion of up to 7 amino acids from the N-terminus of mature FGF21 does not abolish the molecule's biological activity (in contrast with the in vitro analysis, which suggested that the deletion of 7 amino acids from the N-terminus of mature FGF21 would abolish activity).\n\n\nThe differing results obtained with particular N-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides (e.g., FGF21 8-181) in in vitro and in vivo assays can be explained by the interaction of FGF21 with beta-klotho and FGF receptor in effecting signal transduction. In particular, FGF21 activates a dual receptor complex comprising the co-receptor beta-klotho and FGF receptor (FGFR), which initiates a signaling cascade involving tyrosine kinase. The N-terminus of FGF21 has been shown involved in binding and activation of FGFR while the C-terminus of FGF21 is required for beta-klotho interaction (Yie et al., 2009 \nFEBS Lett. \n583:19-24). The ELK-luciferase in vitro assay is performed in 293 kidney cells in which the co-receptor beta-klotho is overexpressed and FGFR is expressed at normal levels. The amount of FGFR is low in relative to that of beta-klotho and the ratio of beta-klotho to FGFR in 293 cells is therefore non-physiological, which may affect receptor complex formation and ultimately ligand binding and activation of FGFR. The 293 in vitro system appears to be more vulnerable to N-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides and therefore may have produced loss of activity results for a few of the N-terminally truncated mutants tested, such as FGF21 8-181. Thus, in determining whether a particular N-terminally truncated FGF21 mutant retained wild-type FGF21 activity, the activity of that FGF21 mutant in the in vivo assay was considered to be dispositive. Accordingly, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 8 amino acid residues are encompassed by the invention.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nPreparation and Expression of Truncated FGF21 Fusion Proteins\n\n\nBecause the half-life of a protein can be increased by fusing the protein to an Fc sequence, fusion proteins comprising truncated FGF21 polypeptides were prepared and analyzed. The truncated FGF21 fusion proteins listed in Table 6 were prepared from amplified FGF21 sequences by SOEing (gene splicing by overlap extension) PCR. FGF21 fusion proteins were prepared such that the Fc portion of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 gene (SEQ ID NO: 13) was fused to either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the FGF21 protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruncated FGF21 Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid Residues\n\n\nFc Position\n\n\nLinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-178\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-175\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-175\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-171\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-170\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-181\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-181\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC- and N-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-175\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-175\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-171\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-170\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-178\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-175\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-175\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-174\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-172\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-171\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, FGF21 fusion protein constructs (including those encoding truncated FGF21 fusion proteins) were prepared in a series of three amplification reactions using essentially the reaction conditions described in Example 1. In the first reaction, a pair of primers was designed to produce a sequence containing an NdeI cloning site, Fc region, and linker sequence. In the second reaction, a pair of primers was designed to produce a sequence containing an overlapping portion of the linker, a portion of the FGF21 coding sequence, and an EcoRI cloning site. Finally, in the third reaction, a pair of primers was designed for the purpose of linking the products of the first two reactions. An exemplary set of primers for the construction of Fc-FGF21 1-181 is listed in Table 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCR Primers for Preparing Exemplary FGF21\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFusion Protein Construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nID NO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReaction\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-AGGAGGAATAACATATGGACAAAACTCACACATG-3′\n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntisense\n \n\n\n5′-GGATCCACCACCACCGCTACCAC-3′\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReaction\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-GGTGGTGGTGGATCCCATCCAATTCCAGATTCTTCTCCA-3′\n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntisense\n \n\n\n5′-TAGTGAGCTCGAATTCTTAGGAAGCGTAGCTGG-3′\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReaction\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-AGGAGGAATAACATATGGACAAAACTCACACATG-3′\n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntisense\n \n\n\n5′-TAGTGAGCTCGAATTCTTAGGAAGCGTAGCTGG-3′\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product of the final reaction was digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI and EcoRI, ligated into the pET30 vector, and then transformed into competent cells.

Truncated FGF21 fusion proteins were prepared by fusing an IgG1 Fc molecule to either the N-terminal or C-terminal end of a truncated FGF21 protein to form a single contiguous sequence. To distinguish between N-terminal and C-terminal fusions, FGF21 fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule was fused to the N-terminal end of the FGF21 protein are designated as Fc-FGF21, and fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule was fused to the C-terminal end of the FGF21 protein are designated as FGF21-Fc.\n\n\nFGF21 possesses a number of biological activities, including the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol levels; reduce body weight; or improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity. To assess in vivo FGF21 activity, FGF21 polypeptides, FGF21 mutant polypeptides, and FGF21 fusion polypeptides were introduced into insulin resistant ob/ob mice, and the ability of a particular FGF21 protein to lower blood glucose levels was measured. The FGF21 polypeptide, FGF21 mutant polypeptide, or FGF21 fusion polypeptide to be tested was injected intraperitoneally into 8 week old ob/ob mice (Jackson Laboratory), and \nblood\n 25 samples were obtained at various time points following a single injection, e.g., 0, 6, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours after injection. Blood glucose levels were measured with a OneTouch Glucometer (LifeScan, Inc. Milpitas, Calif.), and the results expressed as a percent change of blood glucose relative to the baseline level of blood glucose (i.e., at time 0).\n\n\nThe results of one experiment are provided in \nFIG. 4\n, which shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in mice injected with a PBS control, a wild-type Fc-FGF21 control comprising amino acid residues 1-181, or truncated Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 5-181 or 7-181. This experiment demonstrated that truncated Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 5-181 or 7-181 exhibit blood glucose lowering activity that is similar to the activity of wild-type Fc-FGF21 at 6 hours after injection. Thus, the in vivo analysis of truncated FGF21 polypeptides indicated that the deletion of up to 6 amino acids from the N-terminus of mature FGF21 does not affect the molecule's biological activity. In vivo analysis also indicated, however, that the ability of truncated FGF21 polypeptides to lower blood glucose was reduced and that blood glucose levels returned to baseline at 24 hours after injection (similar results were obtained with wild-type FGF21). The short in vivo activity was found to be a result of the proteolytic degradation of FGF21, as described in Example 8.\n\n\nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 5\n, which shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in mice injected with a PBS control, a wild-type FGF21-Fc control comprising amino acid residues 1-181, a truncated FGF21-Fc fusion protein comprising residues 1-175, or a truncated Fc-FGF21 protein comprising amino acid residues 1-171. This experiment demonstrates that the wild-type FGF21-Fc comprising amino acid residues 1-181 has a sustained glucose-lowering activity resulting in a reduction of blood glucose levels of approximately 30% over the time period of 24 hours to 120 hours following injection. The truncated Fc-FGF21 protein comprising amino acid residues 1-171 exhibits delayed blood glucose lowering activity evident only at 72 hours after injection. However, the activity observed is the same as the activity of wild-type FGF21-Fc. The truncated FGF21-Fc fusion protein comprising residues 1-175 is not active in vivo in lowering blood glucose.\n\n\nCollectively, the truncation experiments described herein demonstrate that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins having an N-terminal truncation exhibit blood glucose lowering activity that is similar to that of the wild-type FGF21 fusion protein, and further, that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule has been fused to the N-terminal end of the truncated FGF21 protein exhibit more activity than fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule has been fused to the C-terminal end of the truncated FGF21 protein.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nObserved in Vivo Degradation of FGF21\n\n\nFGF21 degradation was first observed with FGF21 Fc fusion protein constructs as described in Example 7. In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that human FGF21 has a short half-life of about 1 hour in mice due to rapid clearance and in vivo degradation. Therefore, to extend the half-life of FGF21 an Fc sequence was fused to the N- or C-terminal end of the FGF21 polypeptide. However, the fusion of an Fc region did not completely resolve the half-life issue since fusion proteins in which an Fc sequence was fused to the N- or C-terminal end of the FGF21 polypeptide (and in particular Fc-FGF21 fusions, i.e., in which the Fc sequence is fused to the N-terminus of mature FGF21), did not exhibit the expected in vivo efficacy, and instead were found to maintain blood glucose lowering activity for no more than 24 hours in ob/ob mice. As described in \nFIG. 4\n, Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins reduced blood glucose levels by about 30-40% at 6 hours after injection, while the blood glucose levels returned to baseline levels at 24 hours.\n\n\nThe proteolytic degradation of wild-type FGF21 was subsequently investigated, and the rapid loss of in vivo activity with Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins was found to be the result of in vivo degradation of FGF21. Proteolytic degradation leads to decreased biological activity of the molecule in vivo and thus a shorter effective half-life, and such degradation adversely impacts the therapeutic use of that molecule. Accordingly, the observed degradation of FGF21 Fc fusion proteins led to the investigation of the proteolytic degradation of FGF21 in vivo and to identify FGF21 mutants that were resistant to such degradation.\n\n\nTo determine the sites of degradation, LC-MS analysis and Edman sequencing was performed on wild-type human FGF21 and FGF21 Fc fusion proteins obtained at various time points after injection into male C57B6 mice. The Edman sequencing helped confirm whether the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the protein was undergoing degradation. When an Fc sequence was fused to the N-terminus of human FGF21, degradation was found to occur at the peptide bond between amino acid residues 151 and 152 and between amino acid residues 171 and 172 of the human FGF21 portion of the fusion molecule (the residue numbering above is based on the mature FGF21 sequence and does not include the Fc portion of the fusion protein). The degradation at 171-172 was found to occur first, and was followed by degradation at 151-152. Degradation at 171-172 appears to be the rate-limiting step and plays a role in the half-life of the molecule. When an Fc sequence was fused to the C-terminus of FGF21, degradation was found to occur at the peptide bond between \n \namino acid residues\n \n 4 and 5 and between \n \namino acid residues\n \n 20 and 21. As a result of these experiments, it was determined that the Fc sequence appears to protect the portion of the FGF21 sequence that is adjacent to the Fc sequence from degradation. An analysis of the in vivo degradation of wild-type FGF21 and Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins was further conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. These studies confirmed that the cleavage site of FGF21 at amino acid residues 171-172 is the major site of degradation in monkeys and that this site of degradation is conserved between murine and primate.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nIdentification of FGF21 Proteolysis-Resistant Mutants\n\n\nSuitable FGF21 mutants were identified by experimentally determining the positions of the wild-type FGF21 sequence that are sites of major proteolytic activity, and specific amino acid substitutions were introduced at these sites. Amino acid substitutions were based on FGF21 sequence conservation with other species (as described in Example 8) and biochemical conservation with other amino acid residues. A list of amino acid substitutions that were or can be introduced into the wild-type FGF21 protein is provided in Table 8, although Table 8 is only exemplary and other substitutions can be made. The numbers of the positions given in Table 8 correspond to the residue position in the mature FGF21 protein, which consists of 181 amino acid residues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Residues Mutated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nNative Residue\n\n\nMutations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nArg\n\n\nGln, Ile, \nLys\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nTyr\n\n\nHis, Leu, \nPhe\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nLeu\n\n\nIle, Phe, Tyr, Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nTyr\n\n\nIle, Phe, \nVal\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n150\n\n\nPro\n\n\nAla, Arg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n151\n\n\nGly\n\n\nAla, Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n152\n\n\nIle\n\n\nHis, Leu, Phe, Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170\n\n\nGly\n\n\nAla, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, Pro, Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n171\n\n\nPro\n\n\nAla, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gln, Gly,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHis, Lys, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n172\n\n\nSer\n\n\nLeu, Thr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n173\n\n\nGln\n\n\nArg, Glu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nIn Vivo Analysis of Fc-FGF21 and FGF21-Fc Degradation\n\n\nThe stability of FGF21 Fc fusion proteins in vivo was determined by injecting mice with a fusion protein, drawing blood from the mice at various time points, and analyzing the serum by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In particular, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg of Fc(5)FGF21 (expressed in \nE. coli \nand purified as described in Example 2) or FGF21(3)Fc (expressed in mammalian cells and purified according to standard procedures). Blood was drawn from the mice at 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection (Table 9) and collected into EDTA tubes pretreated with protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma was separated by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 g for 10 minutes.

Reduced and non-reduced standards were analyzed by LC-MS using an ACE cyano 0.3 mm×30 cm column with the column effluent spraying into an LCQ Classic ion-trap mass spectrometer. Since the deconvoluted spectra of the reduced samples were cleaner, the affinity purified samples were reduced prior to LC-MS analysis.\n\n\nThe observed masses for the reduced Fc(5)FGF21 standard and samples D6, D24, and D48 are shown in \nFIGS. 6A-6D\n.

The goal of these experiments was to generate FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis and exhibit longer half-lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProteolysis-Resistant FGF21 Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMutation(s)\n\n\nFc\n\n\nLinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19I\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19I\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19Q\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K, Y20H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K, Y20H\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K, L21I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K, L21I\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K, Y20H, L21I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR19K, Y20H, L21I\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20F\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20H\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20L\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20H, L21I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY20H, L21I\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21I\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21F\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21V\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21Y\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY22F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY22F\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY22I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY22I\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY22V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY22V\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150R\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A, G151A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A, G151A\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A, I152V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A, I152V\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A, G151A, I152V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP150A, G151A, I152V\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG151A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG151A\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG151V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG151V\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG151A, I152V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG151A, I152V\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152F\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152H\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152L\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI152V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170A\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170C\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170D\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170N\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170P\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170Q\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170S\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E, P171A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E, P171A\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E, S172L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E, S172L\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E, P171A, S172L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG170E, P171A, S172L\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171A\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171C\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171D\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171E\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171G\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171H\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171K\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171N\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171Q\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171S\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171T\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171W\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171Y\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171A, S172L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP171A, S172L\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nS172L\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nS172T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nS172T\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQ173E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQ173E\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQ173R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQ173R\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 mutant constructs were prepared using primers having sequences that are homologous to regions upstream and downstream of a codon (or codons) to be mutated. The primers used in such amplification reactions also provided approximately 15 nucleotides of overlapping sequence to allow for recircularization of the amplified product, namely the entire vector now having the desired mutant.\n\n\nAn exemplary FGF21 mutant construct, encoding an FGF21 mutant having a glutamic acid residue at position 170 instead of the native glycine residue (i.e., the G170E mutant) was prepared using the primers shown in Table 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCR Primers for Preparing Exemplary FGF21 Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nNO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-ATGGTGGAACCTTCCCAGGGCCGAAGC-3′\n\n\n18\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntisense\n \n\n\n5′-GGAAGGTTCCACCATGCTCAGAGGGTCCGA-3′\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primers shown in Table 12 allow for the substitution of the glycine residue with a glutamic acid residue as shown below, wherein the upper sequence is the sense primer (SEQ ID NO: 18), the second and third sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 20 and 22) are portions of an FGF21 expression construct, and the fourth sequence is the antisense primer (SEQ ID NO: 21):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5′-ATGGTGG\n \nA\n \nACCTTCCCAGGGCCGAAGC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTCCTCGGACCCTCTGAGCATGGTG\n \nGGA\n \nCCTTCCCAGGGCCGAAGCCCCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAGGAGCCTGGGAGACTCGTACCAC\n \nCCT\n \nGGAAGGGTCCCGGCTTCGGGGT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    AGCCTGGGAGACTCGTACCACC\n \nT\n \nTGGAAGG-5′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 mutant constructs were prepared using essentially the PCR conditions described in Example 1. Amplification products were digested with the restriction endonuclease DpnI, and then transformed into competent cells. The resulting clones were sequenced to confirm the absence of polymerase-generated errors. Fc-FGF21 and FGF21-Fc fusion proteins were generated as described herein, e.g., in Example 6.\n\n\nFGF21 mutants were expressed by transforming competent BL21 (DE3) or BL21 Star (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.) cells with the construct encoding a particular mutant. Transformants were grown overnight with limited aeration in TB media supplemented with 40 μg/mL kanamycin, were aerated the next morning, and after a short recovery period, were induced in 0.4 mM IPTG. FGF21 mutant polypeptides were harvested by centrifugation 18-20 hours after induction.\n\n\nFGF21 mutants were also analyzed for predicted immunogenicity. Immune responses against proteins are enhanced by antigen processing and presentation in the major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II binding site. This interaction is required for T cell help in maturation of antibodies that recognize the protein. Since the binding sites of MHC class II molecules have been characterized, it is possible to predict whether proteins have specific sequences that can bind to a series of common human alleles. Computer algorithms have been created based on literature references and MHC class II crystal structures to determine whether linear amino acid peptide sequences have the potential to break immune tolerance. The TEPITOPE computer program was used to determine if point mutations in particular FGF21 mutants would increase antigen specific T cells in a majority of humans. Based on an analysis of the linear protein sequence of each FGF21 mutant, none of the mutants was predicted to enhance immunogenicity.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nImpact of Linker Sequence on FGF21 Degradation\n\n\nTo determine whether the presence of a longer amino acid linker between the Fc sequence and the FGF21 sequence affects FGF21 degradation, mice were injected with FGF21 fusion proteins in which the Fc region was separated from the FGF21 sequence by a 15 amino acid linker having the sequence GGGGGSGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 23), blood was withdrawn from the mice at various time points, and the serum was analyzed by LC-MS. In particular, mice were injected with Fc(15)FGF21 or FGF21(15)Fc. (obtained from \nE. coli\n) at 23 mg/kg, blood was drawn at 6, 24, and 48 hours, and drawn blood was affinity purified using an anti-human-Fc agarose resin.\n\n\nPrior to analyzing the purified samples by LC-MS, Fc(15)FGF21 and FGF21(15)Fc protein standards were analyzed as a reference. Protein standards were either reduced with TCEP or not reduced. Both reduced and non-reduced standards were analyzed by LC-MS using an ACE cyano 0.3 mm×30 cm column with the column effluent spraying into an LCQ Classic ion-trap mass spectrometer. Since the deconvoluted spectra of the reduced samples were cleaner, the affinity purified samples were reduced prior to LC-MS analysis.\n\n\nThe observed masses for the reduced Fc(15)FGF21 standard and corresponding affinity purified samples withdrawn at various time points are shown in \nFIGS. 8A-8D\n. The observed masses for the reduced FGF21(15)Fc standard and corresponding affinity purified samples withdrawn at various time points are shown in \nFIGS. 9A-9D\n. Some of the standard and sample eluates were subjected to Edman sequencing in order to confirm the N-terminus of the proteins and assist in predicting the identity of the fragments observed by LC-MS. Results of the LC-MS analysis of the standards and samples and an indication of predicted fragments are provided in Table 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of LC-MS Analysis and Predicted Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMajor Observed\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n \n\n\nIntact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Sample\n\n\nMasses\n\n\nof Total\n\n\nFragment\n\n\nN-terminus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21\n\n\n46,002 \nDa\n \n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21\n\n\n46,000 \nDa\n \n\n\n65%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\n \nYes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours\n\n\n44,978 \nDa\n \n\n\n35%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21\n\n\n44,978 \nDa\n \n\n\n85%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\n \nYes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n43,022 \nDa\n \n\n\n15%\n\n\n1-394\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21\n\n\n44,976 \nDa\n \n\n\n60%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\n \nYes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n43,019 \nDa\n \n\n\n40%\n\n\n1-394\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21(15)Fc\n\n\n45,999 \nDa\n \n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21(15)Fc\n\n\n45,870 \nDa\n \n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-423\n\n\n \nYes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21(15)Fc\n\n\n45,869 \nDa\n \n\n\n40%\n\n\n1-423\n\n\nSome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n45,301 \nDa\n \n\n\n35%\n\n\n6-423\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n43,460 \nDa\n \n\n\n25%\n\n\n22-423 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21(15)Fc\n\n\n45,870 \nDa\n \n\n\n15%\n\n\n1-423\n\n\nSome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n45,297 \nDa\n \n\n\n20%\n\n\n6-423\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n43,461 \nDa\n \n\n\n65%\n\n\n22-423 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in Table 13, all of the affinity purified samples showed some degree of degradation after only 6 hours of circulation. After 24 hours of circulation, the major products of Fc(15)FGF21 were fragments consisting of amino acid residues 1-414 (85% of sample) and 1-394 (15% of sample), and the major products of FGF21(15)Fc were fragments consisting of amino acid residues 1-423 (40% of sample), 6-423 (35% of sample), and 22-423 (25% of sample). Identified cleavage points for the Fc(15)FGF21 and FGF21(15)Fc proteins are shown in \nFIGS. 10A and 10B\n, respectively.\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nIn Vivo Activity of Proteolysis-Resistant Fc(15)FGF21 Mutants at 1-7 Days After Injection\n\n\nAs described herein, proteolytic cleavage of FGF21 Fc fusion proteins depends upon the orientation of the Fc sequence, with the Fc end of the fusion protein being more stable than the FGF21 end of the fusion protein (i.e., the N-terminal portion of Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins and the C-terminal portion of FGF21-Fc fusion proteins were found to be more stable). For example, cleavage was identified at \n \npositions\n \n 5 and 21 of FGF21-Fc and positions 151 and 171 of Fc-FGF21.\n\n\nAs a result of these observations, an investigation was performed to identify proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants. LC-MS analysis of Fc-FGF21 demonstrates that in vivo proteolytic degradation first occurs between amino acid residues 171-172, followed by degradation between amino acid residues 151-152. By blocking proteolytic degradation at position 171, the cleavage at position 151 can be prevented, effectively extending the half-life of the molecule. However, proteolysis-resistant mutants in which cleavage is prevented at position 151 can still possess residues at position 171 that are susceptible to protease attack, thereby resulting in a molecule missing the last 10 amino acids, which are known to be involved in the binding of the co-receptor beta-klotho, which is a determinant of ligand receptor affinity and in vitro and in vivo potency. Therefore, the mutagenesis of amino acid residues surrounding position 171 in mature FGF21 appear to be more critical for improving the in vivo stability, potency, and efficacy of the molecule.\n\n\nThe in vivo activity of particular proteolysis-resistant Fc(15)FGF21 mutants was assayed by intraperitoneally injecting ob/ob mice with an FGF21 mutant, drawing blood samples from injected mice at 0, 0.25, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after injection, and then measuring blood glucose levels in the samples. The results of one experiment are provided in \nFIG. 11\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with a PBS control, an Fc(15)FGF21 control, or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, Fc(15)FGF21 S172L, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A/S172L, or Fc(15)FGF21 G151A. \nFIG. 12\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. This experiment demonstrates that the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, Fc(15)FGF21 S172L, and Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A/S172L mutants exhibit sustained blood glucose lowering activity for up to 5 days, which is superior to the activity of wild-type Fc-FGF21 The Fc(15)FGF21 G151A mutant only partially improved the duration of blood glucose lowering activity as compared with wild-type Fc-FGF21 fusion protein. Surprisingly, although the Fc(15)-FGF21 S172L mutant is not a proteolysis-resistant mutant, and therefore has similar degradation profile as the wild-type Fc(15)-FGF21 polypeptide, this mutant was found to exhibit improved in vivo efficacy as compared with the wild-type Fc(15)-FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 13\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with a PBS control, an Fc(15)FGF21 control, or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 P150A/G151A/I152V, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A, or Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/S172L. \nFIG. 14\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. As in the experiment described above, the wild-type Fc-FGF21 fusion protein and the Fc(15)FGF21 P150A/G151A/I152V mutant do not exhibit sustained blood glucose lowering activity, possibly because the degradation at 171 site could still occur, and blood glucose levels in animals injected with these proteins returned to baseline at 24 hours after injection. However, the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A, or Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/S172L exhibit maximal blood glucose lowering activity up to 5 days after injection, which is superior to the wild-type Fc-FGF21 fusion protein and the Fc(15)FGF21 P150A/G151A/I152V mutant.\n\n\nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 15\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with a PBS control or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 G170A, Fc(15)FGF21 G170C, Fc(15)FGF21 G170D, Fc(15)FGF21 G170N, or Fc(15)FGF21 G170S. \nFIG. 16\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. All of the FGF21 mutants tested in this experiment exhibited sustained blood glucose lowering activity for up to 5 days after injection.\n\n\nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 17\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with PBS or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171H, Fc(15)FGF21 P171Q, Fc(15)FGF21 P171T, or Fc(15)FGF21 P171Y. \nFIG. 18\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. All of the FGF21 mutants tested in this experiment exhibited improved blood glucose lowering activity when compared with wild-type Fc-FGF21.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nIn Vivo Degradation of Proteolysis-Resistant Fc(15)FGF21 Mutants at 6 to 120 Hours after Injection\n\n\nThe in vivo stability of selected FGF21 mutants was analyzed by injecting mice with an FGF21 mutant, drawing blood from the mice at various time points, and analyzing the serum by LC-MS. In particular, mice were injected with either the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, or Fc(15)FGF21 S172L mutants (obtained from \nE. coli \nas described in Example 2), each of which were diluted in approximately 180 μL of 10 mM HCl prior to injection, and blood was drawn at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours. FGF21 proteins were affinity purified from the drawn blood using an anti-human-Fc agarose resin column. Samples were eluted from the column using 10 mM HCl. All of the FGF21 constructs comprise an Fc region and 15 amino acid linker at the amino-terminal end of the FGF21 protein. Mice were also injected with a wild-type FGF21 control.\n\n\nPrior to analyzing the affinity purified samples by LC-MS, unprocessed wild-type FGF21 and unprocessed FGF21 mutants were analyzed as a reference. All standards and time point samples were reduced with TCEP, and then analyzed by LC-MS using an ACE cyano 0.3 mm×30 cm column with the column effluent spraying into an LCQ Classic ion-trap mass spectrometer. Affinity purified samples were diluted with ammonium acetate, reduced with TCEP, and then analyzed by LC-MS as described above.\n\n\nThe observed masses for wild-type Fc(15)FGF21 at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 19A-19D\n, respectively. The observed masses for Fc(15)FGF21 G170E at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 20A-20D\n, respectively. The observed masses for Fc(15)FGF21 P171A at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 21A-21D\n, respectively. The observed masses for Fc(15)FGF21 S172L at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 22A-22D\n, respectively.\n\n\nAll of the samples drawn at 72 and 120 hours were found to contain a high molecular weight (>200 kDa by non-reducing SDS-PAGE) component of fibrinogen that is much more abundant than the remaining Fc(15)FGF21 fusion protein. Results of the LC-MS analysis of the other standards and samples are provided in Table 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of LC-MS Analysis and Predicted Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMajor Observed\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Sample\n\n\nMasses\n\n\nof Total\n\n\nFragment\n\n\nEdman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 WT\n\n\n45,994 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 WT\n\n\n46,001 Da\n\n\n80%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours\n\n\n44,987 Da\n\n\n20%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 WT\n\n\n44,979 Da\n\n\n~100%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 WT\n\n\n44,980 Da\n\n\n~100%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 G170E\n\n\n46,068 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 G170E\n\n\n46,078 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 G170E\n\n\n46,074 Da\n\n\n80%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n45,761 Da\n\n\n20%\n\n\n1-421\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 G170E\n\n\n46,072 Da\n\n\n~60%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n45,760 Da\n\n\n~40%\n\n\n1-421\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 P171A\n\n\n45,970 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 P171A\n\n\n45,980 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 P171A\n\n\n45,973 Da\n\n\n~70%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n45,657 Da\n\n\n~30%\n\n\n1-421\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 P171A\n\n\n45,992 Da\n\n\n~50%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n45,673 Da\n\n\n~50%\n\n\n1-421\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 S172L\n\n\n46,022 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 S172L\n\n\n46,027 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-424\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 S172L\n\n\n44,984 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc(15)FGF21 S172L\n\n\n44,985 Da\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1-414\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in Table 14, the degradation of wild-type Fc(15)FGF21 and the S172L mutant look similar, in that after 24 hours of circulation, the major product of the fusion protein was a fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1-414. The degradation products of the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E and Fc(15)FGF21 P171A mutants also look similar in that the samples drawn after 24 hours of circulation contain 70-80% intact protein (amino acids 1-424) and 20-30% of a fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1-421. Even after 48 hours, the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E and Fc(15)FGF21 P171A mutants still retain intact protein while showing an increase in the amount of the fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1-421. As observed in prior analyses of Fc-FGF21 constructs, degradation of the FGF21 portion of the fusion protein was detected and the Fc portion was found to remain stable. The cleavage sites identified for wild-type, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, and Fc(15)FGF21 S172L are shown in \nFIGS. 23A-23D\n, respectively.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nIdentification of Aggregation-Reducing FGF21 Mutants\n\n\nOne property of wild-type FGF21 is its propensity to aggregate. Aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants were identified on the basis of two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that, with respect to FGF21, aggregation (or dimerization) is triggered by hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals interactions between FGF21 molecules caused by hydrophobic residues that are exposed to hydrophilic water-based solvent environment. The second hypothesis is that these exposed hydrophobic residues can be substituted to create aggregation-reducing point-mutation variants without compromising FGF21 activity.\n\n\nA systematic rational protein engineering approach was used to identify exposed hydrophobic residues in FGF21. As there were no known X-ray or NMR structures of FGF21 that could be used to identify exposed hydrophobic residues, a high resolution (1.3 Å) X-ray crystal structure of FGF19 (1PWA) obtained from the Protein Databank (PDB) was used to create a 3D homology model of FGF21 using MOE (Molecular Operating Environment; Chemical Computing Group; Montreal, Quebec, Canada) modeling software. FGF19 was chosen as a template, since among the proteins deposited in the PDB, FGF19 is the most closely related protein to FGF21 in terms of the amino acid sequence homology.\n\n\nSolvent accessibility was calculated by the following method using MOE. A first measure of surface area (SA1) is defined as the area of the residue's accessible surface in Å\n2\n. While a particular amino acid residue appears in a protein's primary sequence multiple times, each occurrence of the residue can have a different surface area due to differences in, inter alia, the residue's proximity to the protein surface, the orientation of the residue's side-chain, and the spatial position of adjacent amino acid residues. Therefore, a second measure of surface area (SA2) is made wherein the residue of interest is extracted from the protein structure along with that residue's neighboring, or adjacent, residues. These spatially adjacent residues are mutated in silico to glycines to remove their side-chains, and then the SA2 for the residue of interest is calculated, giving a measure of the total possible surface area for that residue in its particular conformation. A ratio of SA1 to SA2 (SA1/SA2) can then give a measure of the percentage of the possible surface area for that residue that is actually exposed.\n\n\nSeveral hydrophobic residues that are highly exposed to the solvent were selected for further analysis, and in silico point mutations were made to these residues to replace the selected residue with the other naturally occurring amino acid residues. The changes in protein thermal stability resulting from different substitutions were calculated using the FGF21 model and the interactive web-based program CUPSAT (Cologne University Protein Stability Analysis Tools) according to instructions provided at the CUPSAT website. See Parthiban et al., 2006, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n34: W239-42; Parthiban et al., 2007, \nBMC Struct. Biol. \n7:54. Significantly destabilizing or hydrophobic mutations were excluded in the design of aggregation-reducing point-mutation variants. Stabilizing (or, in rare cases, slightly destabilizing) substitutions that introduce improved hydrophilic and/or ionic characteristics were considered as candidates for aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants.\n\n\nA summary of the data generated through this rational protein engineering approach is provided in Table 15, which also lists exemplary FGF21 mutants expected to have reduced protein aggregation and improved stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculated Effect of FGF21 Mutants on Stability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStabilization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue #\n\n\nWT Residue\n\n\nMutation\n\n\n(Kcal/mol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\nA\n\n\nK\n\n\n1.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n1.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n2.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\nA\n\n\nT\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n2.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n1.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n52\n\n\nL\n\n\nT\n\n\n−0.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\nL\n\n\nG\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS\n\n\n−0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\nP\n\n\nA\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n78\n\n\nP\n\n\nA\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC\n\n\n2.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\nL\n\n\nT\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n88\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\n2.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS\n\n\n3.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\n\n\n2.88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n1.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n98\n\n\nL\n\n\nT\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\n\n\n−0.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC\n\n\n3.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n99\n\n\nL\n\n\nC\n\n\n7.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD\n\n\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n1.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n111\n\n\nA\n\n\nT\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\n\n\n−0.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n129\n\n\nA\n\n\nQ\n\n\n3.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN\n\n\n3.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n3.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD\n\n\n3.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n134\n\n\nA\n\n\nK\n\n\n5.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nY\n\n\n4.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\n5.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n\n\n6.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH\n\n\n2.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nPreparation and Expression of Aggregation-Reducing FGF21 Mutants and Fusion Proteins\n\n\nConstructs encoding the FGF21 mutants listed in Table 16 were prepared by PCR amplification of the wild-type FGF21 expression vector as described in Example 11 (the construction of the wild-type FGF21 expression vector is described in Example 1).

Samples to be analyzed were incubated at 4° C., room temperature, or 37° C. for various time points, and then subjected to SEC analysis. Experiments were performed on a Beckman HPLC system equipped with a SEC column. For wild-type FGF21, a TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel G2000 SEC column was used with 2×PBS containing 2% isopropyl alcohol as the mobile phase. For FGF21 Fc fusion proteins and FGF21 mutant polypeptides, a TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel G3000 SEC column was used with 2×PBS as the mobile phase.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nIn Vitro Activity of Aggregation-Reducing FGF21 Mutants\n\n\nExperiments were performed to identify aggregation-reducing mutants that retain wild-type FGF21 activity in an ELK-luciferase in vitro assay. ELK-luciferase assays were performed as described in Example 4. \nFIGS. 24A-24C\n show the results of an ELK-luciferase activity assay performed on the FGF21 mutants FGF21 L99R, FGF21 L99D, and FGF21 A111T (\nFIG. 24A\n); the FGF21 mutants FGF21 A129D, FGF21 A129Q, and FGF21 A134K (\nFIG. 24B\n); and the FGF21 mutants FGF21 A134Y, FGF21 A134E, and FGF21 A129K (\nFIG. 24C\n). The results of these experiments demonstrate that some of the aggregation-reducing mutations did not adversely impact FGF21 activity as assayed in ELK-luciferase assays.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nPreparation and Expression of Fc(15)FGF21 Combination Mutants Showing Longer Half-Life and Lower Levels of Aggregation\n\n\nA number of FGF21 combination mutants, containing mutations shown to reduce aggregation as well as to increase half-life by disrupting proteolytic degradation, were prepared and conjugated to IgG1 Fc molecules. These FGF21 mutants were prepared essentially as described in Example 11.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nIn Vitro Studies of Fc(15)FGF21 Mutants Showing Longer Half-Life and Lower Levels of Aggregation\n\n\nExperiments were performed to identify FGF21 combination mutants that retain wild-type FGF21 activity in an ELK-luciferase in vitro assay. ELK-luciferase assays were performed as described in Example 4.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 25A-25D\n show the results of an ELK-luciferase activity assay performed on the Fc-FGF21 mutants Fc-FGF21 P171G, Fc-FGF21 P171S, and Fc-FGF21 P171T (\nFIG. 25A\n); the Fc-FGF21 mutants Fc-FGF21 P171Y, Fc-FGF21 P171W, and Fc-FGF21 P171C (\nFIG. 25B\n); Fc(15)FGF21, Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/G170E, and FGF21 A45K (\nFIG. 25C\n); and Fc(15)FGF21, Fc(15)FGF21 P171E, and Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/G170E (\nFIG. 25D\n). The results of these experiments demonstrate that mutations aimed at improving stability, or both stability and solubility, did not compromise the in vitro activity as compared with wild-type Fc-FGF21. Interestingly, the FGF21 A45K mutant showed improved potency relative to wild-type Fc-FGF21.\n\n\n \nFIG. 26A\n shows the change in percent aggregation for an FGF21 control (WT) and FGF21 A45K following incubation of 65 mg/mL protein at 4° C. for 1, 2, and 4 days. The data indicated that the A45K mutation leads to a decrease in aggregation of the protein, compared to the wild-type protein.\n\n\n \nFIG. 26B\n shows the change in percent aggregation for an FGF21 control (WT) and FGF21 P78C, P78R, L86T, L86R, L98C, L98R, A111T, A129D, A129Q, A129K, A134K, A134Y, and A134E following incubation of 65 mg/mL protein at 4° C. for 1, 6, and 10 days. The data indicated that the L86R, L98C, L98R, A111T, A129Q, and A129K lead to a decrease in aggregation of the protein, compared to the wild-type protein.\n\n\n \nFIG. 27\n shows the results of an ELK-luciferase activity assay performed on a human FGF21 control and the FGF21 mutants FGF21 A45K, FGF21 L52T, and FGF21 L58E. This experiment demonstrates that the FGF21 A45K mutant retains the full efficacy of wild-type FGF21 and exhibits a potency that is even greater than wild-type FGF21. However, the FGF21 L52T, and FGF21 L58E mutants show reduced potency and efficacy as compared with wild-type FGF21.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 28A-28B\n show the change in aggregation levels for the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 6-181/G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171E Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, and an FGF21 control following incubation at 4° C. for 1, 4, and 8 days. This experiment demonstrates that over the 8 day period, the Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/G170E mutant showed less aggregation than did the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E or Fc(15)FGF21 P171E mutants, but all three mutants showed less aggregation than did the Fc(15)FGF21 control.

In addition, FGF21 stability can be further enhanced by fusing such modified FGF21 proteins with the Fc portion of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 gene. Moreover, by introducing combinations of the above modifications, FGF21 molecules having both enhanced stability and solubility can be generated. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the FGF21 combination mutants listed in Table 18 were prepared using the techniques described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Combination Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\nProteolysis\n\n\nAggregation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidues\n\n\nMutation\n\n\nMutation\n\n\nFc\n\n\nLinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nA45K, L98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171S\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171S\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nA45K, L98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-178\n\n\nG170E\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFIG. 29\n shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with the Fc(15)FGF21 combination mutants Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/P171G, or Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G.\n\n\nIn another experiment the FGF21 mutant Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G was studied side-by-side with wild-type mature FGF21 and Fc-FGF21. In one experiment, a recombinant 293T cell line was cultured in the presence of different concentrations of FGF21, Fc-FGF21, or Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G for 6 hours. Cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in \nFIG. 30\n, Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G had similar activity to Fc-FGF21, indicating that the introduction of the two point mutations didn't alter the molecule's in vitro activity.\n\n\nIn yet another experiment, the stability of the Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G at 65 mg/mL was evaluated for nine days at two different temperatures, namely room temperature and 4° C., side-by-side with FGF21 and Fc-FGF21. After the incubation period cell lysates were then analyzed with SEC-HPLC to determine an aggregation versus time profile at various temperatures. The data shown in \nFIGS. 31A and 31B\n indicate that the rate of aggregation formation was significantly reduced in the Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G at room temperature (solid triangles, dotted line in \nFIG. 31A\n) and at 4° C. (solid triangles, dotted line in \nFIG. 31B\n).\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\nProteolysis-Resistant FGF21 Mutants Comprising C-Terminal Mutations\n\n\nThe in vivo stability of combination mutants was also studied. Specifically, the in vivo stability of Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G was compared with the stability of Fc(15)FGF21 in murine and cynomolgus models. The results were found to be similar in both species. In the cynomolgus study, Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G and Fc(15)FGF21 were injected IV at 23.5 mg/kg and aliquots of serum and plasma were collected at time points out to 840 hours post dose. Time points out to 168 hours were analyzed. Time point samples were affinity-purified using anti-Fc reagents, then analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry. The results correlated well between the two analyses.\n\n\nAnalyzing data generated using immunoaffinity-MALDI, clipping at the P171 site was seen to be eliminated in the Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G molecule as a result of the mutation of P171 to P171G. However, a minor and slow degradation resulting in a loss of up to 3 C-terminal residues was observed for Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G (\nFIG. 32\n). The minor cleavages at the three C-terminal residues were also observed with other FGF21 mutants after the more susceptible cleavage site between amino acid residues 171 and 172 was blocked as shown in \nFIGS. 20 and 21\n. The 3 C-terminal residue cleavage may represent the cessation of cleavage from the C-terminal end of the molecule by a carboxypeptidase in a sequential, residue-by-residue fashion or a specific protease attack at amino acid residues 178 and 179 with non-specific clipping at amino acid residues 179-180 and 180-181. The loss of 2-3 amino acids at the C-terminus could cause reduced beta-klotho binding and ultimately decreased potency and in vivo activity of the molecule See, e.g., Yie et al., 2009\n, FEBS Lett. \n583:19-24. To address the apparent carboxypeptidase degradation of the C-terminus, the impact of adding an amino acid residue “cap” to various FGF21 mutant polypeptides were studied. A variety of constructs, including those presented in Table 19, were made and assayed using the techniques described herein. Table 19 summarizes the results of the in vitro ELK luciferase assay.\n\n\nSuitable amino acid caps can be between 1 and 15 amino acids in length, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 15 amino acids in length. Any number and type of amino acid(s) can be employed as a cap, for example, a single proline residue, and single glycine residue, two glycine residues, five glycine residues, as well as other combinations. Additional examples of caps are provided in the instant Example and in Table 19.\n\n\nAdditionally, to address the apparent protease attack at amino acid residues 178 and 179, mutation of amino acid residues at \npositions\n 179, 180 and 181 was studied. Again, a variety of constructs, including those presented in Table 19, were made and assayed using the techniques described herein. The impact of combinations of cap and mutations at these sites was also explored. Table 19 summarizes exemplary constructs that were made and studied in the in vitro ELK-luciferase assay, which was performed as described herein. Consistent with the terminology used herein, hFc means a human Fc sequence (i.e., SEQ ID NO:13), L15 refers to a linker having 15 residues (i.e., SEQ ID NO:23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy and EC50 Values for FGF21 Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprising C-terminal Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructs\n\n\nEfficacy\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuFGF21\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n100.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G)\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n76.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179F)\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n78.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, 1-180)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, 1-179)\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n77.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180E)\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n79.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181K)\n\n\n130\n\n\n87.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSGSGSGSGS.hFGF21.L15.hFc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMKEDD.hFGF21.L15.hFc\n\n\n834\n\n\n83.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181P, P182)\n\n\n272\n\n\n69.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180G)\n\n\n3.25\n\n\n76.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181G)\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n77.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, L182)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFGF21(L98R, P171G, G182)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179P)\n\n\n428\n\n\n44.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179G)\n\n\n61\n\n\n82.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179S)\n\n\n25.3\n\n\n74.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179A)\n\n\n43.2\n\n\n79.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181T)\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n77.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181A)\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n73.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181L)\n\n\n3.46\n\n\n72.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181P)\n\n\n33.8\n\n\n79.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180P)\n\n\n617\n\n\n77.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180S)\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n84.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFGF21(L98R, P171G, GGGGG182-6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, P182)\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n85.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, G182)\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n71.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(1-178, L98R, P171G)\n\n\n167\n\n\n63.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, GG182-3)\n\n\n1941\n\n\n84.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, GGGGG182-6)\n\n\n4307\n\n\n99.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFIG. 33\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in diabetic db/db mice (C57B6 background) injected with a PBS control, wild type native FGF21, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G) and two capped molecules to which either a proline or glycine residue was added at the C-terminal end, i.e. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G). In the instant Example, when a residue was added to the C-terminus of a wild-type or mutant FGF21 polypeptide, the residue is referred to by its position in the resultant protein. Thus, “182G” indicates that a glycine residue was added to the C-terminus of the mature 181 residue wild-type or mutant protein. \nFIG. 33\n shows that native FGF21 lowered blood glucose levels for 6 hours while all three Fc(15)FGF21 mutants studied showed sustained blood glucose-lowering activity for at least 120 hours. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P), molecule comprising the addition of a proline residue at the C-terminus of the FGF21 component of the fusion molecule, appeared most potent and resulted in lowest blood glucose levels compared with Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182 G).\n\n\nIn a subsequent experiment, the in vivo activity of (L98R, P171G, 182G) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P) was studied and compared to the in vivo activity of a capped molecule comprising a two glycine addition at the C-terminus, namely Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, \n182G\n 183G). \nFIG. 34\n shows the results of that experiment. \nFIG. 34\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in ob/ob mice injected with PBS control, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, \n182G\n 183G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P).\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 34\n, all of the molecules studied showed sustained glucose-lowering activity compared with the PBS control. This experiment confirmed the previous results (\nFIG. 33\n) that Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P) with a proline addition at the C-terminus showed slightly enhanced glucose-lowering efficacy compared with the molecule without a proline cap, e.g. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G). However, the addition of two glycine residues at the C-terminus, e.g. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, \n182G\n 183G), appeared to reduce the molecule's in vivo potency and shortened the duration of in vivo glucose-lowering effect.\n\n\n \nFIG. 35\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in diabetic db/db mice (C57B6 background) injected with PBS control or the FGF21 mutant polypeptides Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171Q, Y179S), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179A), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180S), and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180G). All mutants showed similar glucose-lowering activity with similar duration of action.\n\n\n \nFIG. 36\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in diabetic db/db mice (C57B6 background) injected with vehicle control, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc-FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179F), and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180E). Compared with Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179F) was less efficacious in lowering blood glucose. However, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180E), in which alanine at amino acid position of 180 was mutated to glutamic acid, was more efficacious than Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G) and caused additional 20% reduction of blood glucose levels compared with Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G). These data suggest that A180E mutation may have reduced the C-terminal degradation in vivo and thereby improved in vivo potency and efficacy of the molecule.\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\nRhesus Monkey Study\n\n\nAn Fc-Linker-FGF21 construct was generated using methodology described herein. The construct comprised an IgG1 Fc sequence (SEQ ID NO:13) fused at the C-terminus to a (Gly)\n5\n-Ser-(Gly)\n3\n-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser linker sequence (SEQ ID NO:23) which was then fused at the C-terminus to the N terminus of a mature FGF21 sequence (SEQ ID NO:4), into which two mutations, L98R and P171G, had been introduced. This construct was then expressed and purified as described herein, and was isolated as a dimeric form of the protein, each monomer of which was linked via intermolecular disulfide bonds between the Fc region of each monomer. This molecule is referred to in the instant Example as “Fc-FGF21(RG)” and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:38 and is encoded by SEQ ID NO:37. In this Example, FGF21 refers to the mature form of FGF21, namely SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\n22.1 Study Design\n\n\nThe Fc-FGF21(RG) construct was administered chronically and subcutaneously (“SC”) into non-diabetic male Rhesus monkeys with a BMI>35. Two other groups of monkeys (n=10 per group) were treated with either mature FGF21 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:4) or a vehicle control.\n\n\nAnimals were acclimated for 42 days prior to administration of any test compound and were then divided into groups of 10 and administered multiple SC injections of test compounds or control article in a blinded fashion, as depicted graphically in \nFIG. 37\n. In brief, each animal was injected once a day with compound or vehicle. FGF21 was administered daily, whereas Fc-FGF21(RG) was administered weekly. Fc-FGF21(RG) and FGF21 doses were escalated every 2 weeks, as shown in \nFIG. 37\n. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the study. The CRO was blinded to the treatment.\n\n\nTwo oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed prior to the start of the treatment. OGTT1 was used to sort the animals into three equivalent groups having a similar distribution of animals based on area under the curve (AUC) and body weight. The results of the second OGTT (OGTT2) was used to confirm the sorting of the first OGTT (OGTT1). Monkeys with OGTT profiles that were inconsistent from one test (OGTT1) to the next (OGTT2) were excluded. The results of \n \nOGTTs\n \n 1 and 2 are shown in \nFIGS. 38A and 38B\n, with AUC measurements shown in \nFIG. 38C\n. Baseline body weight is shown in \nFIG. 38D\n and Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n \nOGTTs\n \n \n 3, 4, and 5 were performed every 2 weeks at the end of each dose treatment of low, mid and high doses. Blood samples were collected from fasted animals weekly and were used to measure glucose, insulin, triglyceride levels, as well as the levels of test compound. Blood samples were also collected weekly during the 3-week washout period.\n\n\nBaseline OGTT1 and OGTT2 showed an expected glucose profile as seen in normal animals, with a maximum plasma glucose obtained at 30 minutes, and demonstrated stable AUCs for the 3 different groups.\n\n\nFasting baselines values for plasma chemistry are shown in Table 20. Plasma chemistry measurements were performed on blood samples collected prior to the start of the treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline Values for Body Weight, Fasting Plasma Glucose, Insulin,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand Triglyceride Levels of the Three Groups of \nRhesus \nMonkeys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVehicle\n\n\nFGF21\n\n\nFc-FG21 (RG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nN\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody weight (kg)\n\n\n8.5 ± 0.5\n\n\n8.7 ± 0.4\n\n\n 8.5 ± 0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma glucose\n\n\n91.9 ± 4.8 \n\n\n94.8 ± 5.3 \n\n\n82.2 ± 3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin (pg/mL)\n\n\n942.6 ± 121.4\n\n\n976.1 ± 107.7\n\n\n1023.4 ± 205.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriglycerides (mg/dL)\n\n\n44.4 ± 4.8 \n\n\n58.6 ± 5.2 \n\n\n71.7 ± 9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree different dose levels were selected, the low dose was 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, the mid dose was 0.3 and 1 mg/kg and the high dose was 1 and 5 mg/kg for FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG), respectively. Dose levels were chosen based on the observed dose-response in mice, with a dosing regimen based on the anticipated frequency of injection in humans. Equimolar doses of FGF21 were used for the low and mid doses, and the Fc-FGF21(RG) high dose was raised to 5 mg/kg (i.e., instead of 3 mg/kg, which would have been equimolar to the 1 mg/kg FGF21 dose).\n\n\n22.2 Effect of Test Compounds on Body Weight\n\n\nIn this experiment, in order to measure effect of the test compounds on body weight measured weekly, the percent body weight change from baseline was calculated weekly in the three different groups of Rhesus monkeys. Body weight was also measured during the three week of wash out period. Baseline body weight values for each group are included in Table 20.\n\n\nBody weight was followed throughout the study, both pre- and post-administration of test compounds. Body weight percent change from baseline of the vehicle animals increased with time, whereas body weight of animals treated with Fc-FGF21(RG) and FGF21 decreased in a dose-dependent fashion over the course of the 6 week treatment period, as shown in \nFIG. 39\n. As observed previously in rodents (Xu et al., \nDiabetes \n58(1):250-9 (2009)), treatment with FGF21 statistically significantly decreased body weight. Fc-FGF21(RG) had a greater exposure than did FGF21 (\nFIG. 48\n and \nFIG. 47\n, respectively), offering a possible explanation for the observation that Fc-FGF21(RG) showed a more pronounced body weight decrease than FGF21.\n\n\n22.3. Effect of Test Compounds on Insulin Levels\n\n\nInsulin levels were measured in blood samples that had been collected after an overnight fast or after an afternoon meal.\n\n\nFasting plasma insulin levels were measured in Rhesus monkeys every week in animals treated with either vehicle, FGF21 or Fc-FGF21(RG) and during the 3-week washout period. Fasted blood samples were drawn approximately five days after the last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 21 hours after the last FGF21 injection.\n\n\nFed plasma insulin levels were measured in Rhesus monkeys during the fifth and sixth week of treatment with either vehicle or FGF21 during the high dose treatment. Fed blood samples were drawn approximately three days after Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 2 hours after last FGF21 injection. \nFIG. 40\n shows the effect of vehicle, FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) on fasted insulin levels over the full nine week study, while \nFIG. 41\n depicts fed insulin levels determined from samples taken during \n \nweeks\n \n 5 and 6.\n\n\nSummarily, at the two highest doses, both FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) statistically significantly decreased fasted and fed plasma insulin levels. The observation that insulin levels of animals treated with FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) were decreased without observing increased glucose levels is indicative of increased insulin sensitivity.\n\n\n22.4 Effect of Test Compounds on OGTT (Glucose and Insulin)\n\n\nThree OGTTs (\n \nOGTTs\n \n 3, 4 and 5) were performed after treatment was initiated. OGTT5 glucose and insulin level profiles were measured in animals treated for 6 weeks with vehicle, FGF21 or Fc-FGF21(RG), corresponding to the last two weeks of the high dose escalation regimen. OGTT5 was conducted approximately 7 days after the last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection, and approximately 21 hours after the last FGF21 injection. The OGTT5 glucose and insulin profiles are shown in \nFIG. 42\n and \nFIG. 43\n, respectively. Animals treated with Fc-FGF21(RG) showed an improved glucose clearance compared to vehicle-treated animals only at the highest dose and at the last time point measured, as shown in \nFIG. 42\n. At the end of the last dose, Fc-FGF21(RG) showed the strongest improvement in glucose clearance. FGF21 showed no improvement in glucose clearance. Fc-FGF21(RG) had a greater exposure than did FGF21 (\nFIG. 48\n and \nFIG. 47\n, respectively), offering a possible explanation for the observation that Fc-FGF21(RG) showed a more pronounced effect in glucose clearance than FGF21. Insulin levels during OGTT5 were statistically significantly lowered at the last time point measured in animals treated with Fc-FGF21(RG) compared to animals treated with vehicle.\n\n\nGlucose AUC percent change from baseline was calculated for the three OGTT (\n \nOGTTs\n \n 3, 4 and 5) performed at the end of each of the low, mid and high doses in the three groups different groups of Rhesus monkeys as shown in \nFIG. 44\n. OGTT5 was conducted approximately seven days after the last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and 21 hours after last FGF21 injection and showed that Fc-FGF21(RG) statistically significantly reduced AUC5. Baseline OGTT values for each group are shown on \nFIG. 38C\n.\n\n\nFasted plasma glucose levels were measured on days when no OGTTs were performed. There were no meaningful statistical differences observed in fasted plasma glucose levels measured among the three groups of animals.\n\n\n22.5 Effect of Test Compounds on Triglyceride Levels\n\n\nPercent change of fasting plasma triglyceride levels was calculated in Rhesus monkeys every week in animals treated with either vehicle, FGF21 or Fc-FGF21(RG) and during the 3-week washout period. Fasted blood samples were drawn approximately five days after last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 21 hours after last FGF21 injection. Triglyceride levels were measured every week after the treatment was initiated and percent changes from baseline are shown in \nFIG. 45\n, fasting baseline values are shown in Table 20.\n\n\nAs depicted in \nFIG. 45\n, animals treated with either Fc-FGF21(RG) or FGF21 showed a dose-dependent decrease in triglyceride levels, with Fc-FGF21(RG) having the greatest lowering effect compared to FGF21.\n\n\n \nFIG. 46\n shows the plasma triglyceride levels in samples acquire from Rhesus monkeys in a fed state, during the fifth and sixth week of treatment with vehicle or Fc-FGF21(RG) or FGF21. Fed blood samples were drawn approximately 3 days after Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 2 hours after last FGF21 injection. Fed plasma triglyceride levels of animals treated with FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) were statistically significantly reduced, compared to the triglyceride levels of animals treated with vehicle (\nFIG. 46\n).\n\n\n22.6 Concentration of Test Compounds\n\n\nThe exposure of the tested compounds administered at approximately equivalent molar dose levels was assessed throughout the study period. The concentration of Fc-FGF21 (RG) was measured at pre-dose, and approximately 5 days after the last injection. FGF21 levels were measured at pre-dose, and at 5, 12, 19, and 26 days. Blood samples were drawn at approximately 21 hours after the last injection.\n\n\nThe individual concentration of the tested compounds in each monkeys are shown in \nFIGS. 47 and 48\n. As shown in \nFIG. 47\n, the majority of the animals in the FGF21-treated group had concentrations below the quantitation limit. \nFIG. 48\n shows that animals in the Fc-FGF21(RG)-treated group had detectable levels of Fc-FGF21(RG) during each dosing phase (two weekly doses at the same dose strength). The average concentration from each dosing phase increased approximately dose-proportionally from 0.3 to 5 mg/kg for Fc-FGF21(RG). There is minimal accumulation as demonstrated by the steady concentrations after the first and second weekly dose within each dose escalation phase for both compounds. During the treatment-free phase (washout period) Fc-FGF21(RG) levels were detectable up to approximately day 47 (12 days post last dose) and were below lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) afterwards.\n\n\nExposure of the test compounds was also monitored during each OGTT. FGF21 was not detectable during \n \nOGTTs\n \n 3 and 4, following low- and mid-dose FGF21 treatment. However, measurable levels were observed during OGTT5, following high-dose treatment. A dose proportional increase in Fc-FGF21(RG) levels was observed across the third to fifth OGTT with escalating dose levels, as shown in \nFIG. 49\n.\n\n\nCompound levels data confirm that the animals were exposed to the expected amount of each compound, namely FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG), in a dose escalation manner. A large variability was observed in the amount of FGF21 measured, which was an expected result considering the sampling was performed approximately 21 hours post the last dose and the half life of FGF21 is approximately 1 hour.\n\n\n22.7 Conclusions\n\n\nFGF21 decreased fasted and fed plasma triglyceride and insulin levels and decreased body weight at the highest doses. Fc-FGF21(RG) improved OGTT and decreased insulin levels at the highest dose, and dose dependently decreased fasted and fed plasma triglyceride levels as well as body weight. Both FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) decreased a number of metabolic parameters in the non diabetic Rhesus monkeys. Insulin and triglyceride level decreases were identical between FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) when circulating compound levels were in a similar range, in the fed condition. Due to its improved properties, Fc-FGF21(RG) was superior to FGF21 in most of the parameters measured and could be administered once-a-week to observe efficacy on metabolic parameters.\n\n\nWhile the present invention has been described in terms of various embodiments, it is understood that variations and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art.

In certain embodiments, these cyclodextrin-containing polymers improve drug stability and/or solubility, and/or reduce toxicity, and/or improve efficacy of the topoisomerase inhibitor when used in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, by selecting from a variety of linker groups that link or couple CDP to a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, and/or targeting ligands, the rate of drug release from the polymers can be attenuated for controlled delivery. The invention also relates to methods of treating subjects with compositions described herein. The invention further relates to methods for conducting a pharmaceutical business comprising manufacturing, licensing, or distributing kits containing or relating to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, the present invention provides water-soluble, biocompatible polymer conjugates comprising a water-soluble, biocompatible polymer covalently attached to the topoisomerase inhibitor through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric conjugates featured in the methods described herein may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of a bioactive/therapeutic agent, such as camptothecin, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the agent from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve drug half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize drug metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative.

The most common cyclodextrins are alpha ((α)-cyclodextrins, beta (β)-cyclodextrins and gamma (γ)-cyclodextrins which contain, respectively six, seven, or eight glucopyranose units. Structurally, the cyclic nature of a cyclodextrin forms a torus or donut-like shape having an inner apolar or hydrophobic cavity, the secondary hydroxyl groups situated on one side of the cyclodextrin torus and the primary hydroxyl groups situated on the other. Thus, using (β)-cyclodextrin as an example, a cyclodextrin is often represented schematically as follows.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side on which the secondary hydroxyl groups are located has a wider diameter than the side on which the primary hydroxyl groups are located. The present invention contemplates covalent linkages to cyclodextrin moieties on the primary and/or secondary hydroxyl groups. The hydrophobic nature of the cyclodextrin inner cavity allows for host-guest inclusion complexes of a variety of compounds, e.g., adamantane.

In certain embodiments, one or more of these terminal carboxyl groups may be capped by covalently attaching them to a therapeutic agent, a targeting moiety, or a cyclodextrin moiety via an (thio)ester or amide bond. In still other embodiments, linker groups with one or more terminal hydroxyl, thiol, or amino groups may be incorporated into the polymer. In preferred embodiments, one or more of these terminal hydroxyl groups may be capped by covalently attaching them to a therapeutic agent, a targeting moiety, or a cyclodextrin moiety via an (thio)ester, amide, carbonate, carbamate, thiocarbonate, or thiocarbamate bond.

In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety is a moiety that promotes selectivity in the cleavage of the bond between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Such a moiety may, for example, promote enzymatic cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Alternatively, such a moiety may promote cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety under acidic conditions or basic conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may comprise a self-cyclizing moiety or a selectivity-determining moiety, or both.

In certain embodiments, the linker group itself can be stable under physiological conditions, such as an alkyl chain, or it can be cleavable under physiological conditions, such as by an enzyme (e.g., the linkage contains a peptide sequence that is a substrate for a peptidase), or by hydrolysis (e.g., the linkage contains a hydrolyzable group, such as an ester or thioester). The linker groups can be biologically inactive, such as a PEG, polyglycolic acid, or polylactic acid chain, or can be biologically active, such as an oligo- or polypeptide that, when cleaved from the moieties, binds a receptor, deactivates an enzyme, etc. Various oligomeric linker groups that are biologically compatible and/or bioerodible are known in the art, and the selection of the linkage may influence the ultimate properties of the material, such as whether it is durable when implanted, whether it gradually deforms or shrinks after implantation, or whether it gradually degrades and is absorbed by the body. The linker group may be attached to the moieties by any suitable bond or functional group, including carbon-carbon bonds, esters, ethers, amides, amines, carbonates, carbamates, sulfonamides, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be an alkyl group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from aryl, heteroaryl, carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —OC(O)—, —C(═O)O—, —NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, is H or lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates a CDP, wherein a plurality of topoisomerase inhibitors are covalently attached to the polymer through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the therapeutic agents as discussed above, wherein administration of the polymer to a subject results in release of the therapeutic agent over a period of at least 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 24, 36, 48 or even 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the conjugation of the topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP improves the aqueous solubility of the topoisomerase inhibitor and hence the bioavailability. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the topoisomerase inhibitor has a log P>0.4, >0.6, >0.8, >1, >2, >3, >4, or even >5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate of the present invention preferably has a molecular weight in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates attenuating the rate of release of the topoisomerase inhibitor by introducing various tether and/or linking groups between the therapeutic agent and the polymer. Thus, in certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates of the present invention are compositions for controlled delivery of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugate Characteristics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP and/or CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition as described herein have polydispersities less than about 3, or even less than about 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention provides an improved delivery of certain topoisomerase inhibitor by covalently attaching one or more topoisomerase inhibitors to a CDP. Such conjugation can improve the aqueous solubility and hence the bioavailability of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein preferably have molecular weights in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the compound has a number average (MO molecular weight between 1,000 to 500,000 amu, or between 5,000 to 200,000 amu, or between 10,000 to 100,000 amu. One method to determine molecular weight is by gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”), e.g., mixed bed columns, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nsolvent, light scattering detector, and off-line dn/dc. Other methods are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is biodegradable or bioerodable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative, or prodrug thereof makes up at least 3% (e.g., at least about 5%) by weight of the polymer. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 20% by weight of the compound. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 5%, 10%, 15%, or at least 20% by weight of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of the topoisomerase inhibitor, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the topoisomerase inhibitor from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve topoisomerase inhibitor half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize topoisomerase inhibitor metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be a flexible or flowable material. When the CDP used is itself flowable, the CDP composition of the invention, even when viscous, need not include a biocompatible solvent to be flowable, although trace or residual amounts of biocompatible solvents may still be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it is possible that the biodegradable polymer or the biologically active agent may be dissolved in a small quantity of a solvent that is non-toxic to more efficiently produce an amorphous, monolithic distribution or a fine dispersion of the biologically active agent in the flexible or flowable composition, it is an advantage of the invention that, in a preferred embodiment, no solvent is needed to form a flowable composition. Moreover, the use of solvents is preferably avoided because, once a polymer composition containing solvent is placed totally or partially within the body, the solvent dissipates or diffuses away from the polymer and must be processed and eliminated by the body, placing an extra burden on the body's clearance ability at a time when the illness (and/or other treatments for the illness) may have already deleteriously affected it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, when a solvent is used to facilitate mixing or to maintain the flowability of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, it should be non-toxic, otherwise biocompatible, and should be used in relatively small amounts. Solvents that are toxic should not be used in any material to be placed even partially within a living body. Such a solvent also must not cause substantial tissue irritation or necrosis at the site of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable biocompatible solvents, when used, include N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, ethanol, propylene glycol, acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, oleic acid, or 1-dodecylazacylcoheptanone. Preferred solvents include N-methylpyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetone because of their solvating ability and their biocompatibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are soluble in one or more common organic solvents for ease of fabrication and processing. Common organic solvents include such solvents as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, 2-butanone, butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein, upon contact with body fluids, undergo gradual degradation. The life of a biodegradable polymer in vivo depends upon, among other things, its molecular weight, crystallinity, biostability, and the degree of crosslinking In general, the greater the molecular weight, the higher the degree of crystallinity, and the greater the biostability, the slower biodegradation will be.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a subject composition is formulated with a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material, release of the topoisomerase inhibitor or other material for a sustained or extended period as compared to the release from an isotonic saline solution generally results. Such release profile may result in prolonged delivery (over, say 1 to about 2,000 hours, or alternatively about 2 to about 800 hours) of effective amounts (e.g., about 0.0001 mg/kg/hour to about 10 mg/kg/hour, e.g., 0.001 mg/kg/hour, 0.01 mg/kg/hour, 0.1 mg/kg/hour, 1.0 mg/kg/hour) of the topoisomerase inhibitor or any other material associated with the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of factors may affect the desired rate of hydrolysis of CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions, the desired softness and flexibility of the resulting solid matrix, rate and extent of bioactive material release. Some of such factors include the selection/identity of the various subunits, the enantiomeric or diastereomeric purity of the monomeric subunits, homogeneity of subunits found in the polymer, and the length of the polymer. For instance, the present invention contemplates heteropolymers with varying linkages, and/or the inclusion of other monomeric elements in the polymer, in order to control, for example, the rate of biodegradation of the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo illustrate further, a wide range of degradation rates may be obtained by adjusting the hydrophobicities of the backbones or side chains of the polymers while still maintaining sufficient biodegradability for the use intended for any such polymer. Such a result may be achieved by varying the various functional groups of the polymer. For example, the combination of a hydrophobic backbone and a hydrophilic linkage produces heterogeneous degradation because cleavage is encouraged whereas water penetration is resisted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne protocol generally accepted in the field that may be used to determine the release rate of a therapeutic agent such as a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material loaded in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles or compositions of the present invention involves degradation of any such matrix in a 0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37° C., an assay known in the art. For purposes of the present invention, the term “PBS protocol” is used herein to refer to such protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the release rates of different CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be compared by subjecting them to such a protocol. In certain instances, it may be necessary to process polymeric systems in the same fashion to allow direct and relatively accurate comparisons of different systems to be made. For example, the present invention teaches several different methods of formulating the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions. Such comparisons may indicate that any one CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition releases incorporated material at a rate from about 2 or less to about 1000 or more times faster than another polymeric system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a comparison may reveal a rate difference of about 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 750 times. Even higher rate differences are contemplated by the present invention and release rate protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, when formulated in a certain manner, the release rate for CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may present as mono- or bi-phasic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelease of any material incorporated into the polymer matrix, which is often provided as a microsphere, may be characterized in certain instances by an initial increased release rate, which may release from about 5 to about 50% or more of any incorporated material, or alternatively about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40%, followed by a release rate of lesser magnitude.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe release rate of any incorporated material may also be characterized by the amount of such material released per day per mg of polymer matrix. For example, in certain embodiments, the release rate may vary from about 1 ng or less of any incorporated material per day per mg of polymeric system to about 500 or more ng/day/mg. Alternatively, the release rate may be about 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 ng/day/mg. In still other embodiments, the release rate of any incorporated material may be 10,000 ng/day/mg, or even higher. In certain instances, materials incorporated and characterized by such release rate protocols may include therapeutic agents, fillers, and other substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the rate of release of any material from any CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition of the present invention may be presented as the half-life of such material in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the embodiment involving protocols for in vitro determination of release rates, in vivo protocols, whereby in certain instances release rates for polymeric systems may be determined in vivo, are also contemplated by the present invention. Other assays useful for determining the release of any material from the polymers of the present system are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysical Structures of the CDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugates, Particles and Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions may be formed in a variety of shapes. For example, in certain embodiments, CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates may be presented in the form of microparticles or nanoparticles. Microspheres typically comprise a biodegradable polymer matrix incorporating a drug. Microspheres can be formed by a wide variety of techniques known to those of skill in the art. Examples of microsphere forming techniques include, but are not limited to, (a) phase separation by emulsification and subsequent organic solvent evaporation (including complex emulsion methods such as oil in water emulsions, water in oil emulsions and water-oil-water emulsions); (b) coacervation-phase separation; (c) melt dispersion; (d) interfacial deposition; (e) in situ polymerization; (f) spray drying and spray congealing; (g) air suspension coating; and (h) pan and spray coating. These methods, as well as properties and characteristics of microspheres are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,438,253; U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,441; U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,669; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,768; U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,110; U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,175; and European Patent 0258780, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare microspheres, several methods can be employed depending upon the desired application of the delivery vehicles. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying, milling, co-precipitation and critical fluid extraction. In the case of spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying and critical fluid extraction; the components (stabilizing polyol, bioactive material, buffers, etc.) are first dissolved or suspended in aqueous conditions. In the case of milling, the components are mixed in the dried form and milled by any method known in the art. In the case of co-precipitation, the components are mixed in organic conditions and processed as described below. Spray drying can be used to load the stabilizing polyol with the bioactive material. The components are mixed under aqueous conditions and dried using precision nozzles to produce extremely uniform droplets in a drying chamber. Suitable spray drying machines include, but are not limited to, Buchi, NIRO, APV and Lab-plant spray driers used according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe shape of microparticles and nanoparticles may be determined by scanning electron microscopy. Spherically shaped nanoparticles are used in certain embodiments, for circulation through the bloodstream. If desired, the particles may be fabricated using known techniques into other shapes that are more useful for a specific application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to intracellular delivery of a topoisomerase inhibitor, it also possible that particles of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, such as microparticles or nanoparticles, may undergo endocytosis, thereby obtaining access to the cell. The frequency of such an endocytosis process will likely depend on the size of any particle.\n\n\n \n \nIn one embodiment, the surface charge of the molecule is neutral, or slightly negative. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the particle surface is from about −80 mV to about 50 mV.\n\n\n \nCDPs, Methods of Making Same, and Methods of Conjugating CDPs to Topoisomerase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein can be prepared in one of two ways: monomers bearing topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties can be polymerized, or polymer backbones can be derivatized with topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties. Exemplary methods of making CDPs and CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,270,808, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDPs described herein can be made using a variety of methods including those described herein. In some embodiments, a CDP can be made by: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors; providing comonomer precursors which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomer precursors); and copolymerizing the said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP wherein CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers alternate in the water soluble linear polymer. In some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin momomers comprise linkers to which the topoisomerase inhibitor may be further linked\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent can be achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is suitable for the attachment of sufficient topoisomerase inhibitor such that up to at least 3%, 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP, when conjugated, is topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu.

This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the CPT to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of CPT is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin, by weight of the polymer, can vary. Therefore, while Scheme XIII depicts CPT at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached to the gly at each of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be made by providing a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomers), wherein the cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers alternate in the CDP and wherein the CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers; and attaching a topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via a linker. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer through an attachment that is cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer at a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via an optional linker to a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties comprise linkers to which therapeutic agents are linked\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is made by a process comprising: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors, providing comonomer precursors, and copolymerizing said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers. In some embodiments, the CDP is conjugated with a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin to provide a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the CDP via a linker. In some embodiments, the linker is cleaved under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor makes up at least 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer comprises polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 3,400 Da, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises beta-cyclodextrin, the theoretical maximum loading of camptothecin on a CDP-camptothecin conjugate is 13%, and camptothecin is 6-10% by weight of the CDP-camptothecin conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C═C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is poorly soluble in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of at least 6 hours. In some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of 6 hours to a month. In some embodiments, upon administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject the rate of topoisomerase inhibitor release is dependent primarily upon the rate of hydrolysis as opposed to enzymatic cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the polymer by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-polymer conjugate of the following formula can be made as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nproviding a polymer below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand coupling the polymer with a plurality of L-D moieties, wherein L is a linker, or absent and D is topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, to provide:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least 4, wherein on the final product, L can be a linker, a bond, or OH, and D can be a topoisomerase inhibitor (e.g., camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative) or absent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction scheme as provided above includes embodiments where L-D is absent in one or more positions as provided above. This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the topoisomerase inhibitor-linker to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of topoisomerase inhibitor-linker is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor, by weight of the polymer, can vary, for example, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor can be at least about 3% by weight, e.g., at least about 5%, at least about 8%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, or at least about 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, at least a portion of the L moieties of L-D is absent. In some embodiments, each L is independently an amino acid or derivative thereof (e.g., glycine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the coupling of the polymer with the plurality of L-D moieties results in the formation of a plurality of amide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the CDPs are random copolymers, in which the different subunits and/or other monomeric units are distributed randomly throughout the polymer chain. Thus, where the formula X\nm\n—Y\nn\n—Z\no \nappears, wherein X, Y and Z are polymer subunits, these subunits may be randomly interspersed throughout the polymer backbone. In part, the term “random” is intended to refer to the situation in which the particular distribution or incorporation of monomeric units in a polymer that has more than one type of monomeric units is not directed or controlled directly by the synthetic protocol, but instead results from features inherent to the polymer system, such as the reactivity, amounts of subunits and other characteristics of the synthetic reaction or other methods of manufacture, processing, or treatment.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate or particle and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound described herein, e.g., a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, butyrate, citrate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, formate, fumarate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate and undecanoate. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(alkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds described herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gailate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition may include a liquid used for suspending a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which may be any liquid solution compatible with the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which is also suitable to be used in pharmaceutical compositions, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic liquid. Suitable suspending liquids including but are not limited to suspending liquids selected from the group consisting of water, aqueous sucrose syrups, corn syrups, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition described herein may also include another component, such as an antioxidant, antibacterial, buffer, bulking agent, chelating agent, an inert gas, a tonicity agent and/or a viscosity agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and is reconstituted prior to administration to a subject. The lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be reconstituted by a diluent solution, such as a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, or a commercially available diluent, such as PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a lyophilized formulation includes a lyoprotectant or stabilizer to maintain physical and chemical stability by protecting the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition from damage from crystal formation and the fusion process during freeze-drying. The lyoprotectant or stabilizer can be one or more of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a PEG lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-ceramide or D-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), polyoxyethylene esters, poloxomers, Tweens, lecithins, saccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and polyols (e.g., trehalose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, sucrose, glucose and dextran), salts and crown ethers. In one embodiment, the lyoprotectant is mannitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted with a mixture of equal parts by volume of Dehydrated Alcohol, USP and a nonionic surfactant, such as a polyoxyethylated castor oil surfactant available from GAF Corporation, Mount Olive, N.J., under the trademark, Cremophor EL. In some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted in water for infusion. The lyophilized product and vehicle for reconstitution can be packaged separately in appropriately light-protected vials, e.g., amber or other colored vials. To minimize the amount of surfactant in the reconstituted solution, only a sufficient amount of the vehicle may be provided to form a solution having a concentration of about 2 mg/mL to about 4 mg/mL of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Once dissolution of the drug is achieved, the resulting solution is further diluted prior to injection with a suitable parenteral diluent. Such diluents are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These diluents are generally available in clinical facilities. It is, however, within the scope of the present invention to package the subject CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition with a third vial containing sufficient parenteral diluent to prepare the final concentration for administration. A typical diluent is Lactated Ringer's Injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final dilution of the reconstituted CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be carried out with other preparations having similar utility, for example, 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringer's and Dextrose for Injection (D5W), Sterile Water for Injection, and the like. However, because of its narrow pH range, pH 6.0 to 7.5, Lactated Ringer's Injection is most typical. Per 100 mL, Lactated Ringer's Injection contains Sodium Chloride USP 0.6 g, Sodium Lactate 0.31 g, Potassium chloride USP 0.03 g and Calcium Chloride2H2O USP 0.02 g. The osmolarity is 275 mOsmol/L, which is very close to isotonicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The dosage form can be, e.g., in a bog, e.g., a bag for infusion or intraperitoneal administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.\n\n\n \nRoutes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., via intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional or intracranial injection), topically, mucosally (e.g., rectally or vaginally), nasally, buccally, ophthalmically, via inhalation spray (e.g., delivered via nebulzation, propellant or a dry powder device) or via an implanted reservoir. Typically, the compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions. The preferred mode of administration is, e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate(s), particle(s) or composition(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the agent from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, gums, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouthwashes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an agent as an active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or peptidomimetic moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration are useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the a particle described herein include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active particle suspended or dissolved in a carrier with suitable emulsifying agents. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. Suppositories may be prepared by mixing one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein with one or more suitable non-irritating excipients which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature.

In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored in a light blocking container such as an amber vial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, frozen, dried or lyophilized form. It is preferred that a composition including the conjugate, particle or composition, e.g., a composition comprising a particle or particles that include a conjugate described herein be substantially pure and/or sterile. When a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. In one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and, optionally, a diluent solution is provided for reconstituting the lyophilized agent. The diluent can include for example, a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, D5W, or PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, IV admixture bag, IV infusion set, piggyback set or syringe, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet. In other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single, undivided container. For example, the composition is contained in a bottle, vial or syringe that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each containing one or more unit dosage forms (e.g., a dosage form described herein) of a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. For example, the kit includes a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a single unit dose of a particle described herein. The containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or evaporation), and/or light-tight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit optionally includes a device suitable for administration of the composition, e.g., a syringe, inhalant, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, dropper (e.g., eye dropper), swab (e.g., a cotton swab or wooden swab), or any such delivery device. In one embodiment, the device is a medical implant device, e.g., packaged for surgical insertion.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be used in combination with other known therapies. Administered “in combination”, as used herein, means that two (or more) different treatments are delivered to the subject during the course of the subject's affliction with the disorder, e.g., the two or more treatments are delivered after the subject has been diagnosed with the disorder and before the disorder has been cured or eliminated or treatment has ceased for other reasons. In some embodiments, the delivery of one treatment is still occurring when the delivery of the second begins, so that there is overlap in terms of administration. This is sometimes referred to herein as “simultaneous” or “concurrent delivery”. In other embodiments, the delivery of one treatment ends before the delivery of the other treatment begins. In some embodiments of either case, the treatment is more effective because of combined administration. For example, the second treatment is more effective, e.g., an equivalent effect is seen with less of the second treatment, or the second treatment reduces symptoms to a greater extent, than would be seen if the second treatment were administered in the absence of the first treatment, or the analogous situation is seen with the first treatment. In some embodiments, delivery is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one treatment delivered in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive. The delivery can be such that an effect of the first treatment delivered is still detectable when the second is delivered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the at least one additional therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously, in the same or in separate compositions, or sequentially. For sequential administration, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered first, and the additional agent can be administered second, or the order of administration can be reversed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with other therapeutic treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, cryosurgery, and/or thermotherapy. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered agent and/or other chemotherapeutic agent, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. The phrase “radiation” includes, but is not limited to, external-beam therapy which involves three dimensional, conformal radiation therapy where the field of radiation is designed to conform to the volume of tissue treated; interstitial-radiation therapy where seeds of radioactive compounds are implanted using ultrasound guidance; and a combination of external-beam therapy and interstitial-radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as a chemotherapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., with one or more chemotherapeutic agents described herein.

For example, cystisis can be mitigated or treated with MESNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiarrhea may be treated with antidiarrheal agents including, but not limited to opioids (e.g., codeine (Codicept®, Coducept®), oxicodeine, percocet, paregoric, tincture of opium, diphenoxylate (Lomotil®), diflenoxin), and loperamide (Imodium A-D®), bismuth subsalicylate, lanreotide, vapreotide (Sanvar®, Sanvar IR®), motiln antagonists, COX2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib (Celebrex®), glutamine (NutreStore®), thalidomide (Synovir®, Thalomid®), traditional antidiarrhea remedies (e.g., kaolin, pectin, berberine and muscarinic agents), octreotide and DPP-IV inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDPP-IV inhibitors employed in the present invention are generically and specifically disclosed in PCT Publication Nos.: WO 98/19998, DE 196 16 486 A1, WO 00/34241 and WO 95/15309.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNausea and vomiting may be treated with antiemetic agents such as dexamethasone (Aeroseb-Dex®, Alba-Dex®, Decaderm®, Decadrol®, Decadron®, Decasone®, Decaspray®, Deenar®, Deronil®, Dex-4®, Dexace®, Dexameth®, Dezone®, Gammacorten®, Hexadrol®, Maxidex®, Sk-Dexamethasone®), metoclopramide (Reglan®), diphenylhydramine (Benadryl®, SK-Diphenhydramine®), lorazepam (Ativan®), ondansetron (Zofran®), prochlorperazine (Bayer A 173®, Buccastem®, Capazine®, Combid®, Compazine®, Compro®, Emelent®, Emetiral®, Eskatrol®, Kronocin®, Meterazin®, Meterazin Maleate®, Meterazine®, Nipodal®, Novamin®, Pasotomin®, Phenotil®, Stemetil®, Stemzine®, Tementil®, Temetid®, Vertigon®), thiethylperazine (Norzine®, Torecan®), and dronabinol (Marinol®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with an immunosuppressive agent. Immunosuppressive agents suitable for the combination include, but are not limited to natalizumab (Tysabri®), azathioprine (Imuran®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®), cyclosporins (e.g., Cyclosporin A (Neoral®, Sandimmun®, Sandimmune®, SangCya®), cacineurin inhibitors (e.g., Tacrolimus (Prograf®, Protopic®), sirolimus (Rapamune®), everolimus (Afinitor®), cyclophosphamide (Clafen®, Cytoxan®, Neosar®), or methotrexate (Abitrexate®, Folex®, Methotrexate®, Mexate®)), fingolimod, mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®), mycophenolic acid (Myfortic®), anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., Basiliximab (Simulect®) or daclizumab (Zenapax®)), and anti-TNFα antibody (e.g., Infliximab (Remicade®) or adalimumab (Humira®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole (Nizoral®, Xolegel®), itraconazole (Sporanox®), clarithromycin (Biaxin®), atazanavir (Reyataz®), nefazodone (Serzone®, Nefadar®), saquinavir (Invirase®), telithromycin (Ketek®), ritonavir (Norvir®), amprenavir (also known as Agenerase, a prodrug version is fosamprenavir (Lexiva®, Telzir®), indinavir (Crixivan®), nelfinavir (Viracept®), delavirdine (Rescriptor®) or voriconazole (Vfend®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen employing the methods or compositions, other agents used in the modulation of tumor growth or metastasis in a clinical setting, such as antiemetics, can also be administered as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen formulating the pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention the clinician may utilize preferred dosages as warranted by the condition of the subject being treated. For example, in one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered at a dosing schedule described herein, e.g., once every one, two, three or four weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in general, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and an additional chemotherapeutic agent(s) do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered intravenously while the chemotherapeutic agent(s) may be administered orally. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every three weeks and an additional therapeutic agent (or additional therapeutic agents) may also be administered every three weeks for as long as treatment is required. Examples of other chemotherapeutic agents which are administered one every three weeks include: an antimetabolite (e.g., floxuridine (FUDF®), pemetrexed (ALIMTA®), 5FU (Adrucil®, Efudex®, Fluoroplex®)); an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin (Cerubidine®, Rubidomycin®), epirubicin (Ellence®), idarubicin (Idamycin®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), valrubicin (Valstar®)); a vinca alkaloid (e.g., vinblastine (Velban®, Velsar®), vincristine (Vincasar®, Oncovin®), vindesine (Eldisine®) and vinorelbine (Navelbine®)); a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, larotaxel and cabazitaxel); and a platinum-based agent (e.g., cisplatin (Platinol®), carboplatin (Paraplat®, Paraplatin®), oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent that is administered orally. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more of the following chemotherapeutic agents: capecitabine (Xeloda®), estramustine (Emcyt®), erlotinib (Tarceva®), rapamycin (Rapamune®), SDZ-RAD, CP-547632; AZD2171, sunitinib (Sutent®), sorafenib (Nexavar®) and everolimus (Afinitor®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual dosage of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and/or any additional chemotherapeutic agent employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, when a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, the additional chemotherapeutic agent (or agents) is administered at a standard dose. For example, a standard dosage for cisplatin is 75-120 mg/m\n2 \nadministered every three weeks; a standard dosage for carboplatin is within the range of 200-600 mg/m\n2 \nor an AUC of 0.5-8 mg/ml×min; e.g., at an AUC of 4-6 mg/ml×min; a standard dosage for irinotecan is within 100-125 mg/m\n2\n, once a week; a standard dosage for gemcitabine is within the range of 80-1500 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly; a standard dose for UFT is within a range of 300-400 mg/m\n2 \nper day when combined with leucovorin administration; a standard dosage for leucovorin is 10-600 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosure also encompasses a method for the synergistic treatment of cancer wherein a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with an additional chemotherapeutic agent or agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of conjugate, particle or composition and anti-proliferative cytotoxic agent(s) or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the subject and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the initial order of administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation, may be varied. Thus, for example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation; or the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, anti-neoplastic agent(s), or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual subject's needs, as the treatment proceeds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the subject as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosed CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are useful in treating proliferative disorders, e.g., treating a tumor, e.g., a primary tumor, and/or metastases thereof, wherein the tumor is a primary tumor or a metastases thereof, e.g., a cancer described herein or a metastases of a cancer described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein can be used to treat a solid tumor, a soft tissue tumor or a liquid tumor. Exemplary solid tumors include malignancies (e.g., sarcomas and carcinomas (e.g., adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma)) of the various organ systems, such as those of brain, lung, breast, lymphoid, gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), and genitourinary (e.g., renal, urothelial, or testicular tumors) tracts, pharynx, prostate, and ovary. Exemplary adenocarcinomas include colorectal cancers, renal-cell carcinoma, liver cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, and cancer of the small intestine.

The study was composed of two parts. Part 1 of the Phase 1 study had a primary objective to determine the safety profile, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 when administered weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of every 4-week cycle (the initial dosing regimen, sometimes referred to herein as “weekly×3”). In \npart\n 2, after the first twelve patients were enrolled, an every other week schedule was initiated for the remainder of the Phase 1 program (sometimes referred to herein as “biweekly”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEligibility Criteria. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, or for which no standard curative or palliative therapy existed, were eligible for this trial. Prior treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors was allowed. Main eligibility criteria included male or female patients, at least 18 years of age, with advanced, histologically confirmed solid tumor refractory to standard treatment, or for which no standard therapy existed, measurable or evaluable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status≦2, acceptable organ and bone marrow function, no evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities or ischemia, and ejection fraction≧45%. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or investigational therapy had to be completed within a prescribed interval before enrollment, could not have included high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue bone marrow transplantation, and patients could not have been refractory to prior treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis trial was conducted at City of Hope (COH) (Duarte, Calif.) following approval of the Clinical Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (CPRMC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). After the initial 18 patients were enrolled, an additional site was added at TGen (Scottsdale, Ariz.) following the approval of WIRB (Western Institutional Review Board).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudy design and drug administration. This was an open-labeled, single-arm dose-escalation phase 1 study of CRLX101. In part 1, CRLX101 was administered at 6, 12, or 18 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly schedule three weeks per month. In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered at 12, 15 or 18 mg/m\n2 \non an every other week schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn part 1, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on \ndays\n 1, 8, and 15 followed by a 7 day rest period (28 day cycle). In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on \ndays\n 1 and 15, every 28 days. CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on \ndays\n 1 and 15, every 28 days for the last six patients in \npart\n 2 of the Phase 1 study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting dose in part 1 was 6 mg/m\n2\n. Dose escalation was done using an accelerated Simon design (Simon et al., “Accelerated Titration Designs for Phase I Clinical Trials in Oncology” \nJ Natl Cancer Inst. \n89:1138-47, 1997) with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme. In brief, patients were accrued in cohorts of one at escalating doses until the occurrence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle. Once a DLT occurred, additional patients were accrued in that dosage group to provide for either 3 or 6 patients as provided in a standard dose escalation with the intent of determining the maximum tolerated dose. Concurrent accrual was allowed within the same dose level. No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity Assessment. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) version 3.0. The DLT in a given patient was defined as any treatment-related grade III non-hematologic toxicity, any grade IV hematologic toxicity, or persisting toxicities of any grade requiring delay of scheduled treatment by more than 2 weeks. DLT was based on the first course of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRules for dose escalation. One patient was treated at each dose level. If a DLT attributable to the study drug(s) was experienced, up to 5 additional patients were subsequently treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs were observed at the expanded dose level (i.e., at most 1/6 with an attributable DLT), the dose was escalated. Escalation was terminated when two of six patients experienced any DLT attributable to the study drug at a given dose level. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose level preceding the dose at which≧2/6 patients experienced a first-course DLT. Treatment was continued in an individual patient for a total of 6 cycles at the same dose level if no DLT was observed and if clinical benefit was observed. Therapy was discontinued in any patient if excessive toxicity was experienced. No intra-patient dose escalation was permitted. Patients who completed 6 cycles with clinical benefit had the option of continuing treatment at the same dose level every other week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and efficacy evaluations. Patients were seen, examined and a complete blood count with differential and serum chemistry was obtained before each dose. Radiographic assessments of tumor response (as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor criteria RECIST) were performed every two cycles (Therasse et al., “New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute of the United States, National Cancer Institute of Canada” \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n92:205-16, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment modification. Patients who experienced a DLT during the initial cycle, or a severe or life threatening non-hematologic toxicity at any time during the study, were dose reduced at the next dose administration when their DLT returned to Grade 1. If a non-hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, and the toxicity was not life threatening and resolved rapidly, the next dose administration within the cycle was to be at the next lower dose level. If a hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, the next dose administration was to be at the next lower dose level, even if the blood cell counts recovered by the date of the next scheduled administration. Dosing was to be held for any non-hematologic toxicity grade≧2, except for \ngrade\n 2 fatigue and anorexia. After the first cycle, dose modifications were based on interval toxicity, and platelet and granulocyte counts were obtained on the day of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHematologic toxicity: On day 1 of a cycle, administration of CRLX101 required an absolute granulocyte count (AGC) of ≧1500 and platelet count of ≧100,000. On day 8, if the AGC was ≧1000 and platelet count≧75,000, then CRLX101 was given at full dose and in the same manner for \nday\n 15. If the AGC was <1000, the treating physicians could delay the dose of CRLX101 on \ndays\n 8 and 15. If unacceptable hematologic toxicity persisted >7 days, the CRLX101 dose was reduced to the next lower dose level. Similar standards were used in the biweekly part.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-hematologic toxicity: Any \ngrade\n 2 toxicity that was intolerable to the patients, or any \ngrade\n 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity that was attributed to CRLX101, had to return to grade 1 before a new cycle of treatment was started. Any treatment delay>2 weeks because of toxicity due to CRLX101 would result in the patient being removed from the study. If a patient experienced any \ngrade\n 3 genitourinary (GU) toxicity, the dose of CRLX101 was reduced to the next lower dose level, as CPT has been reported to cause hematuria, cystitis or other GU toxicities, which can be irreversible. If the patient experienced \ngrade\n 3 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to grade 1 before the next treatment, treatment was held until recovery and then reduced by one dose level. If the patient experienced \ngrade\n 4 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to grade 1 before the next treatment, then the dose was reduced by 50% in subsequent cycles. If there were conflicting dose attenuations by hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity, the greater dose reduction was applied. All dose modifications were permanent. Criteria for removal from treatment included disease progression, clinical progression, excessive toxicity, or patient withdrawal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma/urine sampling and analysis. Whole blood samples (5 mL) were collected in heparinized tubes at the following times during cycle one: pre-dose, during dosing at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and just prior to end of administration (90 minutes), and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, (48-72 hr optional), 168 hours (1 week), and 336 hours (only for patients on biweekly schedule) following the first dose. A spot trough PK blood sample was collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and \nDay\n 15 of every cycle. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1,300×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. Plasma was immediately frozen at −20° C., and stored frozen until analysis. For determination of urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unbound CPT, total urine collections were performed following dose 1 of the first cycle (0-24 and 24-48 hours post administration. A spot urine sample (15 mL) was collected at 8, 24, 48, 168 (1 wk), and 336 hours (pre-second dose) for more accurate determination of total to free CPT ratio. Once each urine collection was complete, the actual collection times and total volume of urine was recorded and a 5-10 mL aliquot of each was frozen for subsequent drug level analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) using a validated method. In order to determine total CPT in samples, a 20 μL, aliquot was incubated with 5 μL, 0.2N NaOH for 1 hour to release all CPT from the polymer conjugate. The solution was acidified with 7 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<−20° C.) methanol containing the internal standard 9-nitro camptothecin (9-NC) at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine unconjugated CPT in samples, a 20 μL, aliquot was acidified with 3 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<−20° C.) methanol containing 9-NC at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5 and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLC-MS/MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Palo Alto, Calif.) coupled to a Micromass Quattro Ultima Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Beverly, Mass.). HPLC separation was achieved using a Synergy Hydro-\nRP\n 4 \nμm\n 75×2 mm analytical column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.) preceded by a C\n18 \nguard column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.). The isocratic mobile phase consisted of 34% acetonitrile, 66% 0.5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3.5 at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min at room temperature. MassLynx version 3.5 software was used for data acquisition and processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical analysis of topoisomerase I expression. Ascites fluid from one patient with ovarian cancer was obtained pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post treatment with CRLX101 at 6 mg/m\n2\n. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet frozen. The pellet was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5 μm thick sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene followed by 100% ethanol. Samples were then quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide and pretreated to promote antigen retrieval by steam in DIVA/citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Biocare Medical, Concord, Calif.) solution. After antigen retrieval, slides were incubated in Protein Block for 20 minutes. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4° C. Topoisomerase I antibody was rabbit polyclonal from Abcam (Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next day, slides were washed in Dako Buffer (DB) and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washes in DB, slides were incubated with the chromogen diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopoisomerase I enzymatic activity assay. Lysates containing total cellular protein were made from the plain frozen ascites cells according to the method of Minagawa et al. (“Enhanced Topoisomerase I Activity and Increased Topoisomerase II Alpha Content in Cisplatin-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines” \nJpn J Cancer Res. \n88:1218-23, 1997), a procedure used specifically for frozen cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe catalytic activity of topoisomerase I was determined by measuring the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA using the Topo I assay kit (TopoGEN, Port Orange, Fla.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, reaction mixtures consisted of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA (0.5 μg), whole cell lysate (0.25 μg or 0.5 μg, as indicated in data) and the assay buffer (final concentrations: 10 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.9], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine, and 5% glycerol). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes, and terminated by adding 5 μL stop buffer/gel loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in 1×TAE buffer (40 mM Tris base [pH 8.3, adjusted in the 50× stock buffer using glacial acetic acid], 2.5 mM NaOAc, and 0.05 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed at 4-5 volts per centimeter for 3-4 hours. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and relaxed DNA (0.5 μg) provided by the Topo I assay kit were used as the control markers. The gel was stained with 0.2 μg/mL ethidium bromide for 20 minutes at room temperature, destained in water for 20 minutes and photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed using the ADAPT II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, Los Angeles) non-compartmental model. Results are summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatient Enrollment. Twenty-four patients were enrolled from June 2006 to April 2010.

All patients in the first twelve enrolled (weekly×3) experienced \n \ngrade\n \n 3 or 4 toxicities at doses above 6 mg/m\n2\n. The weekly×3 schedule was stopped after these first twelve patients due to the severe toxicity observed in all patients treated at doses higher than 6 mg/m\n2\n. One patient tolerated 9 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly×3 schedule for five cycles (three doses per cycle).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo patients in the second twelve patients enrolled at the bi-weekly schedule experienced severe toxicity until the MTD was reached. \nGrade\n 2 DLTs included the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne bladder cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia in \ncycle\n 2, day 8. This \ngrade\n 2 hematologic toxicity resolved in two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne lung cancer patient experienced elevated amylase in laboratory tests but no clinical manifestation of pancreatitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne head and neck cancer patient (nasopharyngeal with heavy previous chemotherapy) experienced delayed \nonset grade\n 2 transaminitis in \ncycle\n 2, day 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne lung cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 hematologic toxicity which resolved in two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the highest dose tested, two patients experienced DLT hematological toxicities. The first patient, a breast cancer patient, who had metastatic disease to lung and other organs and had previously received multiple chemotherapy regimens, developed \ngrade\n 3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This patient required platelet transfusions. The second patient had metastatic lung cancer, and had previously received carboplatin and paclitaxel with a brief response. This patient developed \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia, requiring dose reduction and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. This hematological toxicity in 2 of 3 patients established 18 mg/m\n2 \nas the DLT level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne pancreatic cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia on cycle 5, day 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with hepatocellular cancer passed away one week after \ncycle\n 3, day 1 due to progressive disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with lung cancer who had received multiple prior regimens, developed \ngrade\n 2 neutropenia on \ncycle\n 3, \nday\n 15. This patient required a dose reduction and G-CSF support.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the long terminal half-life of polymer conjugated, and especially unconjugated, CPT (see \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n), the protocol was amended in \npart\n 2 to evaluate an every other week schedule. A total of 12 patients were treated on this schedule, three at 12 mg/m\n2 \nand six at 15 mg/m\n2 \nand three at 18 mg/m\n2\n. Except for one occurrence of \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia, no \ngrade\n 3/4 hematologic events were recorded at dose level 12 mg/m\n2 \nand 15 mg/m\n2\n. At dose level 18 mg/m\n2 \none \ngrade\n 4 leukopenia, two \ngrade\n 4 neutropenia, two \ngrade\n 4 thrombocytopenia and one \ngrade\n 3 anemia were reported under hematological toxicities. This determined the DLT of bone marrow suppression at 18 mg/m\n2 \non this schedule. The only other notable non hematologic event was a \ngrade\n 3 hypersensitivity reaction. (Table 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows a summary of all \ngrade\n 3/4 treatment related toxicities for all evaluable patients. Four patients on the weekly schedule developed delayed onset (after cycle 4) mild hematuria and mild dysuria that may have been related to treatment as previously reported for CPT (Muggia et al., “Phase I Clinical Trial of Weekly and Daily Treatment with Camptothecin (NSC-100880): Correlation with Preclinical Studies” \nCancer Chemother Rep \n56:515-521, 1972). However, upon evaluation by a urologist, cystitis could not be confirmed. Thus, at 18 mg/m\n2 \nbiweekly two patients were reported who developed DLT, and the MTD for the biweekly schedule was established as 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment related \ngrade\n 3/4 hematologic and non-hematologic adverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevents by dose cohort observed during all courses of therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nDOSE\n \n \nGrade\n \n 3\n\n\n \nGrade\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nElevated CPK\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFatigue\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlymphopenia\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhyponatremia\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDysuria/\ncystitis\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthrombocytopenia\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nleukopenia\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nneutropenia\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nanemia\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nfatigue\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndehydration\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrash\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSOB\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHypersensitivity\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic analysis. Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected from all patients during cycle 1. Results from this analysis are summarized in \nFIGS. 2A\n, \n2\nB and Table 5. The mean elimination half-lives were 31.8±5.7 hr and 43.8±9.7 hr for conjugated and unconjugated CPT, respectively. Volume of distribution of the polymer conjugate was 4.2±1.1 liter and was independent of dose. The low volume of distribution suggests that CRLX101 is initially retained in plasma and avoids rapid first pass clearance. C\nmax \nand AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n summarize pharmacokinetic parameters measured for polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT for both schedules. Unconjugated CPT was slowly released from CRLX101 as shown by increasing plasma concentrations that peaked at 20.2±9.7 hrs. Plasma concentrations of unconjugated CPT were significantly below the plasma concentrations of conjugated CPT at all timepoints, with unconjugated CPT accounting for an average of 8.7±2.7% of total CPT plasma exposure. \nFIG. 2A\n shows average plasma time-concentration curves for the biweekly 12 mg/m cohort Systemic plasma clearance of conjugated CPT was 0.12±0.2 L/h, significantly below the kidney and liver blood flows in humans, and was also independent of dose. \nFIG. 2B\n shows average urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT in the first 48 hours following CRLX101 administration. Urinary loss of total CPT was variable with an average of 22.8±12.1% of dose excreted during the first 48 hours, of which 78±9% was in the conjugated form. Interestingly, urinary excretion of the polymer conjugate was primarily in the first 24 hours (16.4%±10.0% of dose) compared to the second 24 hours (1.5±1.3% of dose) post administration. Urinary excretion of unconjugated CPT remained approximately constant over both 24 hour periods (2.0±1.1% vs. 2.9±1.4% of dose). Toxicokinetic analysis of the two schedules showed that the predicted monthly exposure for conjugated and unconjugated CPT was similar for 6 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 12 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly and 12 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 15 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly; however, fewer patients experienced cycle one drug related adverse events with the bi-weekly regimen.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters and toxicokinetic summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT\n1/2, β\n \n\n\nAUC\n\n\nPer cycle AUC\n\n\n# Pt with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose/\n\n\nC\nmax \nmg/L\n\n\nhr\n\n\nmg/L/hr\n\n\nmg/L/hr\n\n\nDR AE ≧\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nN\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nGrade. 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n3.55 ±\n\n\n0.10 ±\n\n\n31.1 ±\n\n\n43.7 ±\n\n\n114.4 ±\n\n\n11.9 ±\n\n\n343.2 ±\n\n\n35.7 ±\n\n\n2 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly × 3\n\n\n \n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n21.5\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n64.5\n\n\n21.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n5.55 ±\n\n\n0.18 ±\n\n\n33.8 ±\n\n\n61.5 ±\n\n\n188.5 ±\n\n\n18.3 ±\n\n\n565.6 ±\n\n\n54.9 ±\n\n\n1 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly × 3\n\n\n \n\n\n1.33\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n37.6\n\n\n56.7\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n170.1\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 mg/\nm\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n7.90 ±\n\n\n0.24 ±\n\n\n37.7 ±\n\n\n38.3 ±\n\n\n248.3 ±\n\n\n23.7 ±\n\n\n744.8 ±\n\n\n71.1 ±\n\n\n3 (100%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly × 3\n\n\n \n\n\n1.18\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n29.2\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n87.5\n\n\n17.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n5.56 ±\n\n\n0.22 ±\n\n\n27.8 ±\n\n\n32.5 ±\n\n\n182.0 ±\n\n\n14.6 ±\n\n\n364.0 ±\n\n\n29.0 ±\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbiweekly\n\n\n \n\n\n0.37\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n21.6\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n43.1\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n8.63 ±\n\n\n0.27 ±\n\n\n30.4 ±\n\n\n48.3 ±\n\n\n276.7 ±\n\n\n23.5 ±\n\n\n553.8 ±\n\n\n47.0 ±\n\n\n1 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbiweekly\n\n\n \n\n\n0.76\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n28.3\n\n\n18.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are in geometric means ± standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorrelative Studies. Ascites cells were collected from one patient with ovarian cancer pre-treatment and on \n \nDays\n \n 2 and 25 post-treatment. Pellets of these cells were frozen for later analysis. Levels of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT were also determined in the ascites fluid pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post-treatment. On \nday\n 2, the concentrations detected were 46.6 μg/L for conjugated CPT and 19.6 μg/L for fully active, unconjugated CPT. For each amount of lysate used, there was less topoisomerase I unwinding activity (i.e., more remaining supercoiled DNA) in the \nDay\n 2 samples than in the pretreatment or \nDay\n 25 samples. This suggests an inhibitory effect of CRLX101 on these cells at this early time point after administration. The ascites cells were also used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the levels of topoisomerase I. Basic agreement was observed between the topoisomerase I activity assay and topoisomerase I IHC. As seen in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n, there was a reduction of approximately 30% in staining in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells isolated from the patient's \nascites fluid\n 2 days after treatment (\nFIG. 3B\n), compared to a similar sample taken before drug administration (\nFIG. 3A\n). The decrease in topoisomerase I levels directly seen by IHC in these cells at 48 hours explains why much of the supercoiled DNA remains present in lanes of \nFIG. 3C\n with reactions from \nDay\n 2 lysates; i.e., there is much less enzyme available to act on these substrate molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSummary. In the phase I trial reported above, two dosing schedules, weekly×3 and every other week (biweekly), were investigated. In the weekly×3 schedule the maximum tolerated dose was approximately 9 mg/m\n2\n. Hematologic toxicity and cystitis were the DLTs in this schedule. \nNon-hematologic grade\n 3/4 adverse events included fatigue in 3 patients (25%), delayed onset hematuria/dysuria in 2 patients (17%), elevated CPK (creatine phosphokinase) in 1 patient (8%), and dehydration in 1 patient (8%), all of which were reversible. Cumulative bladder toxicity in some patients on this schedule was primarily observed post cycle one and may have been related to the long terminal half-life of unconjugated CPT, which is primarily cleared through the kidneys, leading to cumulative bladder irritation. Based on this observation, it was decided to investigate a biweekly schedule as a strategy to reduce cumulative toxicity while maintaining dose delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events. The only observed \ngrade\n 3/4 adverse event was \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia in one patient that was reversible. One dose reduction was required on this schedule. On this schedule, CRLX101 was well tolerated without the toxicities normally associated with camptothecin analogs, such as severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic cystitis. The MTD on this schedule was determined to be 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of CRLX101 was performed after the first dose for all patients. Consistent with preclinical data, the pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 were characterized by a low volume of distribution and limited systemic clearance. Preclinical studies showed accumulation of CRLX101 in tumors and tissues of the reticuloendothelial system such as liver and spleen. Increased release of active CPT from the conjugate was also observed in these tissues. This study also confirmed that release kinetics of CPT were such that plasma levels of unconjugated CPT remained significantly below levels of conjugate at all times. After one week, approximately 10% of the maximum recorded concentration of unconjugated CPT was still detected in plasma, possibly leading to the cumulative toxicity observed on the weekly×3 schedule. On the biweekly schedule however, unconjugated CPT levels dropped below the limit of quantitation before the second dose, which may explain the lack of urinary side effects on this schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, CRLX101 was well tolerated and myelosuppression was the DLT. Ten out of twenty-four patients demonstrated stable disease on CT scan evaluation at the end of \ncycle\n 2. One pancreatic cancer patient remained stable for 22.8 months. Serum and urine PK data from all the treated patients indicated that the mean elimination half-lives for conjugated and unconjugated CPT were 31.8 hr and 43.8 hr, respectively.

To this solution were added 1.96 g (16.2 mmol) of L-cysteine and 10.0 g (73.8 mmol) of diiodo, deoxy-β-\ncyclodextrin\n 2. The resulting suspension was heated at a reflux temperature for 4.5 h until the solution turned clear (colorless). The solution was then cooled to room temperature and acidified to \npH\n 3 using 1N HCl. The product was precipitated by slow addition of acetone (3 times weight ratio of the solution). This afforded 9.0 g crude material containing CD-biscysteine (90.0%), unreacted cyclodextrin, CD-mono-cysteine and cystine. The resulting solid was subjected to anionic exchange column chromatography (SuperQ650M, Tosoh Bioscience) using a gradient elution of 0-0.4M ammonium bicarbonate. All fractions were analyzed by HPLC. The desired fractions were combined and the solvent was reduced to 100 mL under vacuum.

When 2.3 eq. of DIEA were added, the viscosity of the polymerization solution increased dramatically after 4-6 hours of reaction. DIEA deprotonates the amino groups of 4 to render them more nucleophilic for coupling with PEG-DiSPA. There were essentially no differences in the polymerizations if other bases, such as TEA or DMAP, were used (36b-c, Table 6). Polymerization using 4 recovered by the two different precipitation methods (acetone and methanol) produced polymers with different MWs. 4 that was purified by the methanol-precipitation method (contains no free cystine) gave higher MW polymer (36d-e) as compared to the less pure 4 that was obtained from the acetone-precipitation method (36a).

The polymer was precipitated with ethyl ether (1 L). The ether was poured out and the precipitate was washed with CH\n3\nCN (3×100 mL). The precipitate was dissolved in \nwater\n 600 mL. Some insoluble solid was filtered through 0.2 μm filters. The solution was dialyzed using 25,000 MWCO membrane (Spectra/Por 7) for 10 h at 10-15° C. in DI water. Dialysis water was changed every 60 minutes. The polymer-drug conjugate solution was sterilized by passing it through 0.2 μM filters.

Another portion of EDC (142 mg, 0.75 mmol, 2.3 eq) and NHS (56 mg, 0.5 mmol, 1.5 eq) were added to the conjugation solution. The polymer was stirred for an additional 22 hours. The workup procedure was the same as that for the synthesis of HGGG6. The yield of HGGG10 was 77%.\n\n\n \n \nDetermination of wt % CPT on the Conjugates Stock solutions of HGGG6, LGGG10, HG6 and HGGG10 were prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in DMSO. An aliquot of corresponding stock solution was diluted to 100 μg/mL using 1 N NaOH. CPT was completely hydrolyzed in this basic solution and transformed to its carboxylate form within 2 h at room temperature. An aliquot of this solution was diluted to 10 μg/mL using 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and the CPT carboxylate form was transformed to its lactone form. 30 μL of this solution was injected into the HPLC. The peak area from the CPT lactone form was integrated and compared to a standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n11 and 12 were conjugated to 36e or 36f (Table 2) using conventional coupling methods. Due to the instability of the ester linker of 11 and 12 in aqueous solution, the conjugation was conducted in anhydrous DMSO under argon. An organic base was required to deprotonate the TFA salts of 11 and 12 to facilitate the coupling. For polymer conjugation with 12, the weight percent (wt %) drug loading was around 6-10%. The theoretical maximum drug loading is around 13% using PEG with MW of 3400 Da; maximum values can be increased by decreasing the MW of the PEG segments. Solubilities of all conjugates in water or PBS were more than 200 mg/mL (equivalent to a 12-20 mg CPT/mL for 6-10 wt % drug loading, respectively).

Synthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg Copolymer with a Short Peg Linkage and its GlyCPT Conjugate\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nSynthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg (Short PEG, e.g., Peg200-Peg2000) and its \nCPT Conjugate\n 42\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of polymer and \ndrug conjugate\n 42 are same as 36, 37, and 38\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile Scheme VI shows that the drug is attached at all available positions, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VI depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod II. Synthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg Copolymer with Multiple Drug Molecules on Each Loading Site.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nSynthesis of CD-BisCys-Peg and its GluBis(GlyCPT) Conjugate 43\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n36 and Glu-Bis(Gly-CPT) 17 are dissolved in DMSO. EDC (3 eq), NHS (2.2 eq), and DIEA (2.2 eq) are added to the solution. CD-BisCys-Peg-GluBis(GlyCPT) 43 is precipitated with CH\n3\nCN and washed with the same solvent until no free drug is detected using UV or TLC. 43 is dried under high vacuum. While Scheme VII shows that the drug is attached at all available positions, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CDP reacted at three, two, one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VII depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 4 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include four, three, two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having four, three, two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nSynthesis and In Vitro Analysis of CDP-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n \n \n \nSN-38 was derivatized with the amino acid glycine at the 20-OH position as shown in Scheme VIII. Briefly, 20(S)-7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38, 1.0 g, 2.5 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 70 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) and 30 mL pyridine. A solution of di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (0.83 g, 3.8 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature overnight (12 hours). The solvent was removed under vacuum to yield a yellow solid and re-crystallized from boiling 2-propanol (75 mL) to yield 20(s)-10-tert-butoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethyl-camptothecin (Boc-SN-38) as a yellow solid (0.6 g, 48% yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoc-SN-38 (0.73 g, 1.5 mmol), N-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)glycine (0.26 g, 1.5 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.18 g, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous methylene chloride (30 mL) and chilled to 0° C. 1,3-Diisopropyl-carbodiimide (DIPC, 0.19 g, 1.5 mmol) was added, the mixture stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes followed by stirring for 4 hours at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with methylene chloride to 100 mL, washed twice with an aqueous solution of 0.1N hydrochloric acid (25 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed under vacuum. The resulting yellow solid was purified by flash chromatography in methylene chloride:acetone (9:1) followed by solvent removal under vacuum to yield 20-O—(N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) glycyl)-10-tert-butyoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (diBoc-Gly-SN-38, 640 mg, 67% yield).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCDP was synthesized as previously described (Cheng et al. (2003) Bioconjugate Chemistry 14(5):1007-1017). diBOC-Gly-SN-38 (0.62 g, 0.77 mmol) was deprotected in 15 mL of a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride:trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature for 1 hour. 20-O-trifluoroglycine-10-hydroxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (TFA-Gly-SN-38, 0.57 g, 97% yield) was isolated as a yellow solid by precipitation with ethanol (100 mL), followed by two washes with ethanol (30 mL each), dissolution in methylene chloride and removal of solvent under vacuum. ESI/MS expected 449.4. Found 471.66 (M+Na).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Gly-SN-38 (Poly-CD-PEG-Gly-SN-38, scheme IX) was synthesized as follows: CDP (270 mg, 0.056 mmol), TFA-Gly-SN-38 (70 mg, 0.12 mmol), N-hydroxy-succinimide (14 mg, 0.12 mmol), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDCI, 32 mg, 0.17 mmol) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (10 mL) and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The polymer was precipitated by addition of 50 mL acetone followed by 50 mL diethyl ether. Precipitate was centrifuged, washed twice with 20 mL acetone each, and dissolved in water acidified to pH 3.0 with hydrochloric acid. Polymer solution was dialized for 24 hours against pH 3.0 water using a 25 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane. The resulting solution was lyophilized to yield CDP-Gly-SN-38 (180 mg, 67% yield). The polymer was analyzed for total and free SN-38 content by HPLC using SN-38 as a standard curve as previously described (Cheng et al. (2003) Bioconjugate Chemistry 14(5):1007-1017). Total SN-38 content was 7.66% w/w of which 97.4% was polymer bound. Average particle size was determined by dynamic light scattering to be 27.9 nm.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile Scheme IX shows that the drug is attached at all available positions in the subunit, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme IX depicts SN-38 at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate can have less than 2 SN-38 molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no Sn-38 attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well and grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° C. for 24 h in a humidified 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the test compound at concentrations ranging from 0.01 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L. Triplicate wells per plate were treated at each concentration. Controls were vehicle-treated cells and medium only blank. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 72 h. MTS assay reagent was prepared by diluting CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) 5-fold into PBS/glucose (4.5 g/L). Cell culture medium was aspirated and 100 μL of MTS reagent were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The plates were shaken for 5 min and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm using a SPECTRAFluor Plus plate reader (Tecan). The percentage of cell survival was calculated relative to untreated cells, and IC50s were estimated from the graphs of log dose (nmol/L) versus % cell survival (GraphPad Prizm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this experiment are shown in Table 9 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of SN-38 and CDP-Gly-SN-38 on A2780 ovarian cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSN-38\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDP-PEG-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n7.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nCRLX101 Causes a Dose-Dependent Inhibition of Tumor Growth in a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Model (A549) Possessing a KRAS Mutation\n\n\n \n \n \nA549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Erlotinib at 100 mg/kg resulted in 4.7-day TGD (19%), pemetrexed at 500 mg/kg resulted in 1.9-day TGD (8%), and neither drug yielded D74 survivors or regressions. Both were well-tolerated. Two deaths among pemetrexed-treated mice were classified as non-treatment-related. CRLX101 at 10 mg/kg was well tolerated and resulted in assigned median TTEs of 74 days post first treatment, corresponding to the maximum possible 49.6-day TGD (203%), and yielded 100% complete response and survivors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, CRLX101 at 10 mg/kg qwk×3 resulted in 100% tumor-free survival for 74 days (post first treatment) in the H1299 human NSCLC xenograft model. In comparison, among the marketed drugs administered on optimal preclinical regimens: gemcitabine yielded 50% TFS and three transient regressions; topotecan yielded 10% TFS; docetaxel yielded 20% survival and no TFS; and erlotinib and pemetrexed each had non-significant activities. Docetaxel caused body weight loss within the acceptable limit (<20%) and CRLX101 and all other treatment agents were well-tolerated, except that one animal dosed at 10 mg/kg experienced >15% BW loss on Days 18-25, and was documented to be thin, hunched, and have an impaired gait on D25. This animal subsequently gained weight and survived to the end of the study. Although drug toxicity could not be excluded in this animal, it was unlikely, as no substantial weight loss occurred in other CRLX101-treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Summary of different treatment regimens in a NSCLC H1299 model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResponse Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGr\n\n\nn\n\n\nRegimen\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nTTE\n\n\nT − C\n\n\n% TGD\n\n\nvalue\n\n\nPR\n\n\nCR\n\n\nTFS\n\n\nNadir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n—\n\n\nqwk × 3,\n\n\n24.4\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nGemcitabine\n \n\n\n120\n\n\nq3d × 4,\n\n\n68.7\n\n\n44.3\n\n\n182\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n2\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n−2.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nDocetaxel\n \n\n\n30\n\n\nqwk × 3,\n\n\n27.8\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n55\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−9.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n10\n\n\nTopotecan\n\n\n12\n\n\nq4d × 3,\n\n\n39.2\n\n\n14.8\n\n\n61\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n−0.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nErlotinib\n \n\n\n100\n\n\nqd × 21,\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n19\n\n\n \nNS\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−2.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np.o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nPemetrexed\n \n\n\n500\n\n\nqd x 14,\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n8\n\n\n \nNS\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np.o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nCRLX101\n \n\n\n6\n\n\nQwk × 3,\n\n\n74.0\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n203\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n1\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nCRLX101\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nqwk × 3,\n\n\n74.0\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n203\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n0\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n−1.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = number of animals in a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTE = time to endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT − C = difference between median TTE (days) of treated versus control group,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% TGD = [(T − C)/C] × 100.

The cells were then resuspended in RPMI-1640 (no FBS/antibiotics). NCI-H1299 cells (density=50×10\n6 \ncells in 100 mL) were implanted subcutaneously (SC) into the mammary fat pad of male Taconic NCR nu/nu mice (20-22 g) on day 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFive treatments were administered to mice starting 28 days post tumor implantation, when the group mean tumor volume was 350-384 mm3. The animals were divided into the following treatment groups: 1) PBS solution (q7 d×3); 2) 6 mg/kg CRLX101, weekly for 3 weeks (i.v.) 3) 45 mg/kg sorafenib, daily for 21 days (p.o.); 4); 60 mg/kg sorafenib, daily for 21 days (p.o.); 5) 60 mg/kg sorafenib, daily for 21 days (p.o.) plus 6 mg/kg CRLX101, weekly for 3 weeks (i.v.). Intravenous treatments were given into the tail vein of the mouse at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. Oral treatments were administered at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. Health status of the animals was monitored daily and the body weight and tumor volume were measured two times a week for 4 weeks and then once a week thereafter to evaluate the effect of the treatment. The study endpoint used to determine the tumor growth delay was a group mean tumor size of 1000 mm3. Thereafter, the individual endpoint was a mouse tumor size of 1000 mm\n3\n, after which the mouse was removed from the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments are in the claims."
