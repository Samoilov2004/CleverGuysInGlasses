Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand-bound cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors such as erbB family, PDGF, FGF, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of the ERK pathway is via a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf, a serine-threonine kinase. Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. When activated, ERK1/2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK/MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation, and it is believed that the ERK/MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes, which are upstream of ERK1/2, are mutated in several cancers including colorectal, melanoma, breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition, mutations of BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase of the Raf family, are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas (60%), thyroid cancers (greater than 40%) and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERK1/2 signalling pathway is an attractive pathway for anticancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUS 2002/103229\n \n discloses indazole derivatives having activity as selective inhibitors of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, a welcome contribution to the art would be small-molecules (i.e., compounds) that inhibit ERK activity (i.e., ERK1 and ERK2 activity), which small-molecules would be useful for treating a broad spectrum of cancers, such as, for example, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thryroid cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.

In addition, when a compound of formula 1.0 contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable salts) are preferred. Salts of the compounds of the formula 1.0 may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of formula 1.0 with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. Acids (and bases) which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic (or acidic) pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by \nS.

Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll such acid and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula 1.0, and salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn hetero-atom containing ring systems of this invention, there are no hydroxyl groups on carbon atoms adjacent to a N, O or S, and there are no N or S groups on carbon adjacent to another heteroatom. Thus, for example, in the ring:\n\n \n \n\nthere is no -OH attached directly to carbons marked 2 and 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula 1.0 may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTautomeric forms such as, for example, the moieties:\n\n \n \n\nare considered equivalent in certain embodiments of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"substituted\" means that one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency under the existing circumstances is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. By \"stable compound\" or \"stable structure\" is meant a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"optionally substituted\" means optional substitution with the specified groups, radicals or moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being isolated from a synthetic process or natural source or combination thereof. Thus, the term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being obtained from a purification process or processes described herein or well known to the skilled artisan, in sufficient purity to be characterizable by standard analytical techniques described herein or well known to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a functional group in a compound is termed \"protected\", this means that the group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site when the compound is subjected to a reaction. Suitable protecting groups will be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art as well as by reference to standard textbooks such as, for example, \nT. W. Greene et al, Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocycle, R\n3\n, etc.) occurs more than one time in any moiety or in any compound of formula 1.0, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula 1.0 (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of formula 1.0 can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention provides compounds of formula 1.0:\n\n \n \n\nor the pharmaceutically acceptable

Paclitaxel and its derivatives (e.g. Taxol and Taxotere) are available commercially. In addition, methods of making paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives and analogues are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos: 5,569,729\n \n; \n \n5,565,478\n \n; \n \n5,530,020\n \n; \n \n5,527,924\n \n; \n \n5,508,447\n \n; \n \n5,489,589\n \n; \n \n5,488,116\n \n; \n \n5,484,809\n \n; \n \n5,478,854\n \n; \n \n5,478,736\n \n; \n \n5,475,120\n \n; \n \n5,468,769\n \n; \n \n5,461,169\n \n; \n \n5,440,057\n \n; \n \n5,422,364\n \n; \n \n5,411,984\n \n; \n \n5,405,972\n \n; and \n \n5,296,506\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the term \"paclitaxel\" as used herein refers to the drug commercially available as Taxol\n®\n (NSC number: 125973). Taxol\n®\n inhibits eukaryotic cell replication by enhancing polymerization of tubulin moieties into stabilized microtubule bundles that are unable to reorganize into the proper structures for mitosis. Of the many available chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel has generated interest because of its efficacy in clinical trials against drug-refractory tumors, including ovarian and mammary gland tumors (\nHawkins (1992) Oncology, 6: 17-23\n, \nHorwitz (1992) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 13: 134-146\n, \nRowinsky (1990) J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 82: 1247-1259\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional microtubule affecting agents can be assessed using one of many such assays known in the art, e.g., a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paclitaxel analogs in combination with a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis (see \nLopes (1997) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 41:37-47\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, activity of a test compound is determined by contacting a cell with that compound and determining whether or not the cell cycle is disrupted, in particular, through the inhibition of a mitotic event. Such inhibition may be mediated by disruption of the mitotic apparatus, e.g., disruption of normal spindle formation. Cells in which mitosis is interrupted may be characterized by altered morphology (e.g., microtubule compaction, increased chromosome number, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds with possible tubulin polymerization activity can be screened in vitro. For example, the compounds are screened against cultured WR21 cells (derived from line 69-2 wap-ras mice) for inhibition of proliferation and/or for altered cellular morphology, in particular for microtubule compaction. In vivo screening of positive-testing compounds can then be performed using nude mice bearing the WR21 tumor cells. Detailed protocols for this screening method are described by \nPorter (1995) Lab. Anim. Sci., 45(2):145-150\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods of screening compounds for desired activity are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically such assays involve assays for inhibition of microtubule assembly and/or disassembly. Assays for microtubule assembly are described, for example, by \nGaskin et al. (1974) J. Molec.

Therefore, chemotherapeutic agents, as used herein, include signal transduction inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical signal transduction inhibitors, that are chemotherapeutic agents, include but are not limited to: (i) Bcr/abl kinase inhibitors such as, for example, STI 571 (Gleevec), (ii) Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor inhibitor such as, for example, Kinase inhibitors (Iressa, OSI-774) and antibodies (Imclone: C225 [\nGoldstein et al. (1995), Clin Cancer Res. 1:1311-1318\n], and Abgenix: ABX-EGF) and (iii) HER-2/neu receptor inhibitors such as, for example, Herceptin® (trastuzumab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for the safe and effective administration of most of these chemotherapeutic agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the \"\nPhysicians' Desk Reference\" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742, USA\n), the \nPhysician's Desk Reference, 56th Edition, 2002 (published by Medical Economics company, Inc. Montvale, NJ 07645-1742\n), and the \nPhysician's Desk Reference, 57th Edition, 2003 (published by Thompson PDR, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742\n); the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the compound of formula 1.0 (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of formula 1.0); can be administered orally (e.g., as a capsule), and the chemotherapeutic agents can be administered intravenously, usually as an IV solution. The use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising more than one drug is within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula 1.0 and the chemotherapeutic agents are administered in therapeutically effective dosages to obtain clinically acceptable results, e.g., reduction or elimination of symptoms or of the tumor. Thus, the compound of formula 1.0 and chemotherapeutic agents can be administered concurrently or consecutively in a treatment protocol. The administration of the chemotherapeutic agents can be made according to treatment protocols already known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general when more than one chemotherapeutic agent is used in the uses of this invention, the chemotherapeutic agents are for administration on the same day either concurrently or consecutively in their standard dosage form. For example, the chemotherapeutic agents are usually administered intravenously, preferably by an IV drip using IV solutions well known in the art (e.g., isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) or dextrose solution (e.g., 5% dextrose)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen two or more chemotherapeutic agents are used, the chemotherapeutic agents are generally administered on the same day; however, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the chemotherapeutic agents can be administered on different days and in different weeks. The skilled clinician can administer the chemotherapeutic agents according to their recommended dosage schedule from the manufacturer of the agent and can adjust the schedule according to the needs of the patient, e.g., based on the patient's response to the treatment. For example, when gemcitabine is used in combination with a platinum coordinator compound, such as, for example, cisplatin, to treat lung cancer, both the gemcitabine and the cisplatin are given on the same day on day one of the treatment cycle, and then gemcitabine is given alone on day 8 and given alone again on day 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention and chemotherapeutic agents can be administered in a treatment protocol that usually lasts one to seven weeks, and is repeated typically from 6 to 12 times. Generally the treatment protocol can last one to four weeks. Treatment protocols of one to three weeks can also be used. A treatment protocol of one to two weeks can also be used. During this treatment protocol or cycle the compounds of this invention can be administered daily while the chemotherapeutic agents can be administered one or more times a week. Generally, a compound of this invention can be administered daily (i.e., once per day), and in one embodiment twice per day, and the chemotherapeutic agent is administered once a week or once every three weeks. For example, the taxanes (e.g., Paclitaxel (e.g., Taxol\n®\n) or Docetaxel (e.g.,Taxotere\n®\n)) can be administered once a week or once every three weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, those skilled in the art will appreciate that treatment protocols can be varied according to the needs of the patient. Thus, the combination of compounds (drugs) used in the uses of this invention can be administered in variations of the protocols described above. For example, the compounds of this invention can be administered discontinuously rather than continuously during the treatment cycle. Thus, for example, during the treatment cycle the compounds of this invention can be administered daily for a week and then discontinued for a week, with this administration repeating during the treatment cycle. Or the compounds of this invention can be administered daily for two weeks and discontinued for a week, with this administration repeating during the treatment cycle. Thus, the compounds of this invention can be administered daily for one or more weeks during the cycle and discontinued for one or more weeks during the cycle, with this pattern of administration repeating during the treatment cycle. This discontinuous treatment can also be based upon numbers of days rather than a full week. For example, daily dosing for 1 to 6 days, no dosing for 1 to 6 days with this pattern repeating during the treatment protocol. The number of days (or weeks) wherein the compounds of this invention are not dosed do not have to equal the number of days (or weeks) wherein the compounds of this invention are dosed. Usually, if a discontinuous dosing protocol is used, the number of days or weeks that the compounds of this invention are dosed is at least equal or greater than the number of days or weeks that the compounds of this invention are not dosed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemotherapeutic agent could be given by bolus or continuous infusion. The chemotherapeutic agent could be given daily to once every week, or once every two weeks, or once every three weeks, or once every four weeks during the treatment cycle. If administered daily during a treatment cycle, this daily dosing can be discontinuous over the number of weeks of the treatment cycle. For example, dosed for a week (or a number of days), no dosing for a week (or a number of days, with the pattern repeating during the treatment cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered orally, preferably as a solid dosage form, and in one embodiment as a capsule, and while the total therapeutically effective daily dose can be administered in one to four, or one to two divided doses per day, generally, the therapeutically effective dose is given once or twice a day, and in one embodiment twice a day. The compounds of this invention can be administered in an amount of about 50 to about 400 mg once per day, and can be administered in an amount of about 50 to about 300 mg once per day. The compounds of this invention are generally administered in an amount of about 50 to about 350 mg twice a day, usually 50 mg to about 200 mg twice a day, and in one embodiment about 75 mg to about 125 mg administered twice a day, and in another embodiment about 100 mg administered twice a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the patient is responding, or is stable, after completion of the therapy cycle, the therapy cycle can be repeated according to the judgment of the skilled clinician. Upon completion of the therapy cycles, the patient can be continued on the compounds of this invention at the same dose that was administered in the treatment protocol, or, if the dose was less than 200mg twice a day, the dose can be raised to 200 mg twice a day. This maintenance dose can be continued until the patient progresses or can no longer tolerate the dose (in which case the dose can be reduced and the patient can be continued on the reduced dose).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemotherapeutic agents, used with the compounds of this invention, are administered in their normally prescribed dosages during the treatment cycle (i.e., the chemotherapeutic agents are administered according to the standard of practice for the administration of these drugs). For example: (a) about 30 to about 300 mg/m\n2\n for the taxanes; (b) about 30 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n for Cisplatin; (c) AUC of about 2 to about 8 for Carboplatin; (d) about 2 to about 4 mg/m\n2\n for EGF inhibitors that are antibodies; (e) about 50 to about 500 mg/m\n2\n for EGF inhibitors that are small molecules; (f) about 1 to about 10 mg/m\n2\n for VEGF kinase inhibitors that are antibodies; (g) about 50 to about 2400 mg/m\n2\n for VEGF inhibitors that are small molecules; (h) about 1 to about 20 mg for SERMs; (i) about 500 to about 1250 mg/m\n2\n for the anti-tumor nucleosides 5-Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine and Capecitabine; (j) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Cytarabine (Ara-C) 100-200mg/m\n2\n/day for 7 to 10 days every 3 to 4 weeks, and high doses for refractory leukemia and lymphoma, i.e., 1 to 3 gm/m\n2\n for one hour every 12 hours for 4-8 doses every 3 to four weeks; (k) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Fludarabine (F-ara-A) 10-25mg/m\n2\n/day every 3 to 4 weeks; (I) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Decitabine 30 to 75 mg/m\n2\n for three days every 6 weeks for a maximum of 8 cycles; (m) for the anti-tumor nucleoside Chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA, 2-CdA) 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/day as continuous infusion for up to 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks; (n) about 1 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n for epothilones; (o) about 1 to about 350 mg/m\n2\n for topoisomerase inhibitors; (p) about 1 to about 50 mg/m\n2\n for vinca alkaloids; (q) for the folate antagonist Methotrexate (MTX) 20-60 mg/m\n2\n by oral, IV or IM every 3 to 4 weeks, the intermediate dose regimen is 80-250 mg/m\n2\n IV over 60 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks, and the high dose regimen is 250-1000mg/m\n2\n IV given with leucovorin every 3 to 4 weeks; (r) for the folate antagonist Premetrexed (Alimta) 300-600 mg/m\n2\n (10 minutes IV infusion day 1) every 3 weeks; (s) for the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Hydroxyurea (HU) 20-50 mg/kg/day (as needed to bring blood cell counts down); (t) the platinum coordinator compound Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) 50-100 mg/m\n2\n every 3 to 4 weeks (preferably used for solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer); (u) for the anthracycline daunorubicin 10-50 mg/m\n2\n/day IV for 3-5 days every 3 to 4 weeks; (v) for the anthracycline Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 50-100 mg/m\n2\n IV continuous infusion over 1-4 days every 3 to 4 weeks, or 10-40 mg/m\n2\n IV weekly; (w) for the anthracycline Idarubicin 10-30 mg/m\n2\n daily for 1-3 days as a slow IV infusion over 10-20 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks; (x) for the biologic interferon (Intron-A, Roferon) 5 to 20 million IU three times per week; (y) for the biologic pegylated interferon (Peg-intron, Pegasys) 3 to 4 micrograms/kg/day chronic sub cutaneous (until relapse or loss of activity); (z) for the biologic Rituximab (Rituxan) (antibody used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) 200-400mg/m\n2\n IV weekly over 4-8 weeks for 6 months; (aa) for the alkylating agent temozolomide 75 mg/m\n2\n to 250mg/m\n2\n, for example, 150 mg/m\n2\n, or for example, 200 mg/m\n2\n, such as 200mg/m\n2\n for 5 days; and (bb) for the MEK1 and/or MEK2 inhibitor PD0325901, 15 mg to 30 mg, for example, 15 mg daily for 21 days every 4 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGleevec can be used orally in an amount of about 200 to about 800 mg/day. Thalidomide (and related imids) can be used orally in amounts of about 200 to about 800 mg/day, and can be contiuously dosed or used until releapse or toxicity. See for example \nMitsiades et al., \"\nApoptotic signaling induced by immunomodulatory thalidomide analoqs in human multiple myeloma cells;therapeutic implications\n\", Blood, 99(12):4525-30, June 15, 2002\n, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FPT inhibitor Sarasar® (brand of lonifarnib) can be administered orally (e.g., capsule) in amounts of about 50 to about 200 mg given twice a day, or in amounts of about 75 to about 125 mg given twice a day, or in amounts of about 100 to about 200 mg given twice a day, or in an amount of about 100 mg given twice a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPaclitaxel (e.g., Taxol%, for example, can be administered once per week in an amount of about 50 to about 100 mg/m\n2\n and in another example about 60 to about 80 mg/m\n2\n.

well know to those skilled in the art (e.g., the Physician's Desk Reference or published literature). For example, for Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant, Raloxifene, Anastrozole, Letrozole, Exemestane, Leuprolide and Goserelin, see the Physician's Desk Reference, 57\nth\n Edition, 2003, published by Thomas PDR at Montvale, N.J. 07645-1742, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, in the embodiments directed to the uses for the manufacture of a medicament for treating Breast Cancer: (1) the compound of formula 1.0 (for example, as described in any one of Embodiment Nos. 1 to 161) can be administered daily (e.g., once per day, and in one embodiment twice a day), (2) the aromatase inhibitors can be administered in accordance with the known protocol for the aromatase inhibitor used (e.g., once per day), (3) the antiestrogens can be administered in accordance with the known protocol for the antiestrogen used (e.g., from once a day to once a month), (4) the LHRH analogue can be administered in accordance with the known protocol for the LHRH analogue used (e.g., once a month to once every three months), and (5) the chemotherapeutic agent can be administered in accordance with the known protocol for the chemotherapeutic agent used (e.g., from once a day to once a week).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiation therapy, if administered in the above treatments for breast cancer, is generally administered according to known protocols before administration of the compound of formula 1.0 (for example, as described in any one of Embodiment Nos. 1 to 161), antihormonal agents and optional chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment according to the uses for the manufacture of a medicament for treating breast cancer is continuous (i.e., a continuous dosing schedule is followed). The treatment is continued until there is a complete response, or until the skilled clinician determines that the patient is not benefiting from the treatment (for example, when there is disease progression).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe continuous treatment protocol for breast cancer can be changed to a discontinuous treatment schedule if, in the judgment of the skilled clinician, the patient would benefit from a discontinuous treatment schedule with one or more of the administered drugs. For example, the compound of formula 1.0 (for example, as described in any one of Embodiment Nos. 1 to 161) can be given using a discontinous treatment schedule while the remaining drugs used in the treatment are given as described herein. An example of a discontinuous treatment protocol for the compound of formula 1.0 (for example, as described in any one of Embodiment Nos. 1 to 161) is a repeating cycle of three weeks with the compound of formula 1.0 followed by one week without the compound of formula 1.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter a complete response is achieved with the breast cancer treatment, maintenance therapy with the compound of formula 1.0 (for example, as described in any one of Embodiment Nos. 1 to 161) can be continued using the dosing described in the uses of this invention. Maintenance therapy can also include administration of the antihormonal agents using the dosing described in the uses of this invention. Maintenance therapy can just be with the antihormonal agents. For example, after a complete response is achieved, an aromatase inhibitor (e.g., Anastrozole, Letrozole or Exemestane) can be continued for up to five years. Or, for example, an antiestrogen, e.g., Tamoxifen, may be used for up to five years after a complete response is achieved. Or, for example, an antiestrogen (e.g., Tamoxifen) can be used for up to five years after a complete response is achieved followed by use of an aromatase inhibitor (e.g., Anastrozole, Letrozole or Exemestane) for up to five years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the embodiments directed to the treatment of breast cancer described above, the compound of formula 1.0 (for example, as described in any one of Embodiment Nos. 1 to 161) is administered continuously in a total daily dose of about 100 mg to about 600 mg.

DMSO concentration during initial incubation is 6.7%. ERK2 activity was determined to be insensitive to DMSO concentrations up to 20%. ERK2 was then activated and it's kinase activity measured by the addition of 10µl kinase buffer with the following components (final concentration per reaction): 2ng active (phosphorylated) human MEK1 protein and 4µM (total) ERK2 IMAP substrate peptides (3.9µM unlabeled IPTTPITTTYFFFK-CONH\n2\n and 100nM IPTTPITTTYFFFK(5-carboxyfluorescein)-CONH\n2\n) and 30µM ATP. DMSO concentration during ERK activation was 4%. After one hour, reactions were terminated by addition of 60µl IMAP detections beads in binding buffer (Molecular Devices). Binding was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes before reading the plate on an LJL Analyst Fluorescence Polarization plate reader. Compound inhibition was calculated relative to DMSO and fully inhibited standards. Active compounds were reconfirmed in an independent assay.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nActive ERK2 Assay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nActivated ERK2 activity was also determined in the IMAP assay format using the procedure outlined above. 1µl of 25x compound was added to 14µl of kinase buffer containing 0.25ng fully phosphorylated, active Mouse ERK2 protein. Following a 30 minute incubation, the reactions were initiated by addition of 10µl of kinase buffer containing 1µM ERK2 IMAP substrate peptide (0.9µM unlabeled IPTTPITTTYFFFK-CONH\n2\n and 100nM IPTTPITTTYFFFK(5-carboxyfluorescein)-CONH\n2\n) and 30µM ATP. Reactions proceeded for 30 minutes before termination by addition of 60µl IMAP detection beads in binding buffer. Plates were read as above after 30 minute binding equilibration. Active compounds were reconfirmed in an independent assay.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSoft Agar Assay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnchorage-independent growth is a characteristic of tumorigenic cell lines. Human tumor cells can be suspended in growth medium containing 0.3% agarose and an indicated concentration of a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. The solution can be overlayed onto growth medium solidified with 0.6% agarose containing the same concentration of ERK1 and ERK2 inhibitor as the top layer. After the top layer is solidified, plates can be incubated for 10-16 days at 37°C under 5% CO\n2\n to allow colony outgrowth. After incubation, the colonies can be stained by overlaying the agar with a solution of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Thiazolyl blue) (1 mg/mL in PBS). Colonies can be counted and the IC\n50\n's can be determined.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe AUC (area under the concentration-time curve during the first 6 hours (AUC\n\n\n\n\n6hr\n\n\n\n\n) in Table 27 below was determined using the Protocol of Cassette Accelerating Rapid Rat screen (CARRS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal dosing and sample collection\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Co.) were pre-cannulated (femoral artery) in order to facilitate precise blood sampling times, and to reduce the stress on the animals caused by serial bleedings. Following an overnight fast, two rats were dosed orally with one compound at a dose of 10 mg/kg in a 5-mL/kg dose volume. Blood was collected into heparin-containing tubes serially from each animal at 0.5,1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h post-dosing and centrifuged to generate plasma. Approximately 100 µL of plasma were collected at the individual time points. The plasma samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlasma sample and standard curve preparation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA set of 12 rat plasma samples was generated for each NCE (i.e. 6 timepoints and n = 2 rats). These 12 samples were pooled across the two rats at each timepoint to provide 6 pooled samples (one sample per time point) for each NCE. The pooled samples were assayed as cassettes of six (36 samples total) to provide data on the six compounds. The50-µL aliquots of the 36 plasma samples were placed into individual wells of a 96-well plate. An additional compound (often a structural analog of the test compounds) was selected as the internal standard. A mini-calibration curve was prepared (three points plus a zero) for each compound assayed. Drug-free rat plasma was measured into 1-mL aliquots and each aliquot was spiked with known concentrations of the compounds to generate standards of the desired concentrations. The concentrations of the standards were chosen to bracket the expected concentration of the pooled samples based on historical data from previous studies on other compounds. For this work, the standards were set to contain concentrations of 25, 250 and 2500 ng NCE/mL plasma. The plasma standards were precipitated in duplicate along with the samples. Protein precipitation occurred after addition of 150 µL of acetonitrile containing the internal standard at a concentration of 1 ng/mL into each sample well using the Tomtec Quadra 96 system. The precipitated samples and standards were vortexed and centrifuged in the 96-well plate. Approximately 50-100 µL of the supernatant were removed and placed into a fresh 96-well plate using the Tomtec Quadra 96 system. A volume of 5-10 µL of the supernatant was used for analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. The mini-standard curve was run in duplicate, once before and once after the samples. Thus, a total of 14 study samples plus standards were analyzed per compound. In addition, solvent blanks were injected before and after each set of 14 and after the highest calibration standard for each compound; therefore, a total of 103 injections were made into each HPLC system for each set of six compounds. Multiple solvent blank injections could be made from a single well. Twelve solvent blank wells were designated in each 96-well plate. Thus, one batch (cassette) of six NCEs was prepared and assayed using one 96-well plate format.\n\n\n \n\n\nHPLC-MS/MS analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAll the compounds were analyzed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) methods with LC/MS/MS instruments.
