Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists which contain an alkylaminopyridine derivative as an active ingredient. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a novel alkylaminopyridine derivative.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (hereinafter referred to as NPY), which is a peptide containing 36 amino acids, was first isolated in 1982 from porcine brain by Tatemoto et al. (for example, see Non-Patent Document 1). NPY is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and has a variety of in vivo actions as one of the peptides most abundantly present in the nervous system. That is, in the central nervous system, NPY acts as an aperitive and significantly promotes a fat accumulation via secretion of various hormones and actions of the nervous system. A continuous intracerebroventricular administration of NPY has been known to induce obesity and insulin resistance based on the above actions. NPY is also associated with emotional control and the actions of the central autonomic nervous system. In addition, in the peripheral nervous system, NPY is present together with norepinephrine in the sympathetic nerve ending and associated with the tonicity of the sympathetic nervous system. A peripheral administration of NPY has been known to cause vasoconstriction and enhance actions of other vasoconstrictors including norepinephrine (for example, see Non-Patent Documents 2, 3, 4 and 5). The action of NPY is expressed when it is bonded to an NPY receptor present in the central or peripheral nervous system. Therefore, inhibition of the binding of NPY to the NPY receptor allows prevention of the expression of the action of NPY. Consequently, compounds antagonizing the binding of NPY to the NPY receptor can be expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of various diseases associated with NPY, for example, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, nephropathy, cardiac diseases and angiospasm; diseases of central nervous system such as bulimia, depression, epilepsy, anxiety, alcoholism and dementia; metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hormone abnormality, or glaucoma (for example, see Non-Patent Document 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, derivatives structurally similar to NPY are described to be bonded to an NPY receptor and antagonize the activity of NPY (for example, see Patent Documents 1 and 2 and Non-Patent Document 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain peptides have been recently found to inhibit binding of NPY to an NPY receptor (see Patent Documents 3 and 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, such peptidic compounds have big problems in developing the compounds as medicaments. That is, such high-molecular-weight peptides generally have in vivo instability and are also short-acting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, such compounds are included in a compound group that can be hardly expected to have oral absorption and brain penetrability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, certain nonpeptidic compounds have been recently found to inhibit binding of NPY to an NPY receptor and antagonize the activity of NPY (for example, see Patent Documents 5 and 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, such nonpeptidic NPY antagonists are structurally different from a compound according to the present invention completely and give no suggestion to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a compound associated with an alkylaminopyridine derivative according to the present invention, for example, a compound represented by\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis disclosed in Patent Document 7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, phenyl substituted with methoxy is bonded to methylamino bonded to a pyridine ring in the compound disclosed in Patent Document 7, whereas trifluoromethyl is bonded to methylamino of a compound according to the present invention, which has no substituted phenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a compound represented by\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis disclosed in Patent Document 8.

In the case of injectable preparations in particular, they may be dissolved or suspended in physiological saline or glucose solution if necessary, optionally together with a buffer and a preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen compounds of the present invention are used clinically, for example, a daily dose for an adult is 0.01-100 mg/kg, preferably 0.03-1 mg/kg in a single dose or in divided doses when administered orally, or 0.001-10 mg/kg, preferably 0.001-0.1 mg/kg, more preferably 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, in a single dose or in divided doses when administered parenterally, though the dose and the frequency of dosage may vary depending upon the sex, age, body weight, the severity of condition of a patient, and the type and range of the desired therapeutic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian or clinician can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, suppress or arrest the progress of diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch preparations may contain a compound of the present invention at a rate of 1.0-100%, preferably 1.0-60%, by weight of the total drug. Such preparations may also contain other therapeutically-effective compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other agents useful for treating metabolic and/or eating disorders. The individual components of such combinations can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single preparations. The present invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term “administering” herein is to be interpreted accordingly. It will be understood that the scope of combinations of the compounds of the present invention with other agents useful for treating metabolic and/or eating disorders include in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical composition useful for treating metabolic and/or eating disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus is caused by multiple factors and is characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes mellitus: type 1 diabetes mellitus, or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) caused by hyposecretion of insulin which is a hormone regulating glucose utilization, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), wherein patients exhibit hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin levels that are similar or even elevated in comparison with non-diabetic subjects), while at the same time demonstrating hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is typically treated with exogenous insulin administered via injection. However, type 2 diabetes mellitus often exhibits the phenomena of aggravating insulin resistance, such that the effect of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, namely, muscle, liver and adipose tissues, is diminished. In patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the plasma insulin levels, even when they are elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia. Therefore, the treatment with single administration of exogenous insulin becomes difficult.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin resistance is not yet completely understood. Insulin resistance results in insufficient activation of glucose uptake, diminished oxidation of glucose and storage of glycogen in muscle, inadequate repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and inadequate glucose production and secretion by the liver. The persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs in diabetes mellitus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is at increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications, for example, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-insulin dependent diabetes is also associated with cardiac hypertrophy, in particular left ventricular hypertrophy (Devereux, R. B., Circulation, 101:2271-2276 (2000)). Cardiac hypertrophy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, is due to the chronic blood pressure elevation or increased circulating blood volume. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is characterized by thickening of the left ventricular wall, including increased left ventricular mass, and is defined as a left ventricular mass index exceeding 131 g/m\n2 \nof the body surface area in men, and 100 g/m\n2 \nin women [Savage et al., The Framingham Study, Circulation, 75 (1 Pt 2): 26-33 (1987)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, sudden death and stroke. Therefore, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk. The incidence of morbid events in patients with progression of left ventricular hypertrophy has been reported to be greater than that in patients with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrent treatments for hypertrophy include non-pharmacological interventions, such as weight reduction, sodium restriction and aerobic physical exercise, can reduce left ventricular mass [Ghali, J. K. et al., American Journal of Geriatric Cardiology, 6:38-49 (1997)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany patients who have insulin resistance but have not yet developed type 2 diabetes mellitus are also at a risk of developing metabolic syndrome, also referred to as syndrome X or plurimetabolic syndrome. The period of 5 to 10 years preceding the development of impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a number of hormonal imbalances, which give rise to an enlargement of visceral fat mass, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia [Bjornstop, P., Current Topics in Diabetes Research, eds. Belfore, F., Bergman, R. N., and Molinath, G. M., Front Diabetes, Basel, Karger, 12:182-192 (1993)]. Similarly, metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance, along with enlargement of visceral fat mass, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, syndrome X, low HDL and high VLDL. Although the causal relationship between the various components of metabolic syndrome remains to be confirmed, insulin resistance is likely to play an important role [Requen, G. M., et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 334:374-381 (1996); Despres, J-P., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 334:952-957 (1996); Wajchenberg, B. L., et al., Diabetes/Metabolism Rev. 10:19-29 (1994)]. Patients with metabolic syndrome, whether or not they develop diabetes mellitus, are at increased risk of developing the cardiovascular complications listed above. Associations have been recently reported to be also found between left ventricular hypertrophy and metabolic syndrome [Marcus, R. et al. Circulation, 90:928-936 (1994); Lind, L. et al., J Hypertens. 13:433-38 (1995); Paolisso, G et al., Am J Hypertens., 10:1250-1256 (1997)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType 2 diabetes mellitus is treated with a variety of therapeutic agents including PPAR agonists such as glitazones; biguanides; protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B inhibitors; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors; insulin; insulin mimetics; sulfonylureas; meglitinides; α-glucoside hydrolase inhibitors; and α-amylase inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (for example tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinides, which stimulate the pancreatic β-cells to secrete more insulin, and by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinides become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate insulin-resistant tissues. However, hypoglycemia, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose, can result from, and increasing insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides increase insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. Alpha-amylase inhibitors inhibit the enzymatic degradation of starch or glycogen into maltose, have the action of delaying absorption of glucose in the intestine, and also reduce the amounts of bioavailable sugars. Metformin monotherapy is often used for treating the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also develop obesity and/or dyslipidemia. Lack of appropriate response to metformin will be followed by treatment with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin or alpha glucosidase inhibitors. However, the two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can also induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea, respectively. Alpha glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, cause intestinal functional disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glitazones, also known as thiazolidinediones (such as 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones), are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for a novel mode of action in improving many symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These agents, which are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype, substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma glucose levels without inducing hypoglycemia. Newer PPAR agonists that are being developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or dyslipidemia are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, treatment of diabetes mellitus with PPARγ agonists sometimes results in cardiac hypertrophy, or an increase in heart weight. Recent labeling revisions for Avandia (rosiglitazone maleate), a PPARγ agonist, suggest that patients may experience fluid retention and volume-related events, such as edema and congestive heart failure. Cardiac hypertrophy related to PPARγ agonist treatment is likely to be typically treated by withdrawing PPAR treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus also typically includes weight control with physical exercise and dieting. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Furthermore, weight reduction by increased exercise is difficult for most patients with diabetes mellitus because the patients may also develop related symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbnormal glucose homeostasis is also associated directly or indirectly with obesity, hypertension and lipidosis. Obesity also increases the likelihood of insulin resistance, and the resulting insulin resistance will increase body weight. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity, which can be defined as a body weight more than 20% above the ideal body weight, is a major health concern in Western societies. It is estimated that one out of three adults in the United States is overweight or obese. Obesity is the result of a positive energy balance, as a consequence of increased ratio of caloric intake to energy consumption. [B. Staels et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270(27), 15958 (1995); F. Lonnquist et al., Nature Medicine 1(9), 950 (1995)]. Although the molecular factors regulating food intake and body weight balance are incompletely understood, several genetic factors have been identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpidemiological studies have shown that increasing degrees of overweight and obesity are important predictors of decreased life expectancy. Obesity causes or exacerbates many health problems, both independently and in association with other diseases. The medical problems associated with obesity, which can be serious and life-threatening, include: type 2 diabetes mellitus; hypertension; hyperinsulinism; insulin resistance; lipidosis; hyperlipidemia; endometrial, breast, prostate, kidney and large intestine cancers; degenerative arthritis; respiratory complications, such as non-obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; gallstone disease; arteriosclerosis; cardiac disease; abnormal heart rhythms; and arrhythmia [Kopelman, P. G., Nature 404, 635-643 (2000)]. Obesity is also associated with metabolic syndrome, circulatory disorder such as cardiac hypertrophy, in particular left ventricular hypertrophy, premature death, a significant increase in mortality from stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease and sudden death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbdominal obesity has been linked with coronary artery disease at a high risk, and with three of its major risk factors: high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus that develops in adulthood, and hyperlipidemia. Losing weight dramatically reduces these risks. Abdominal obesity is further closely associated with abnormal glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and other disorders associated with metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), such as decreased levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and increased levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Montague et al., Diabetes, 2000, 49:883-888).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity and obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, are often treated by encouraging patients to lose weight by reducing their food intake or by increasing their exercise level, thereby increasing their energy consumption. A sustained weight loss of 5% to 10% of body weight can lead to improvement of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy, degenerative arthritis and cardiorespiratory dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWeight loss drugs used for the treatment of obesity include orlistat [Davidson, M. H. et al. (1999) JAMA 281:235-42], dexfenfluramine [Guy Grand, B. et al. (1989) Lancet 2:1142-5], sibutramine [Bray, G. A. et al. (1999) Obes. Res. &:189-98] and phentermine [Douglas, A. et al. (1983) Int. J. Obes. 7:591-5]. However, the side effects of such anti-obesity agents may limit their use. Dexfenfluramine was withdrawn from the market because of suspected valvular heart disease; use of orlistat is limited by gastrointestinal side effects; and the use of sibutramine is limited by its cardiovascular side effects which have led to deaths and it was withdrawn from the market in Italy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabetes mellitus,” as used herein, includes both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., IDDM, also known as type 1 diabetes mellitus) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., NIDDM, also known as type 2 diabetes mellitus). The compositions of the present invention are useful for treating both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The compositions are especially effective for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. The compositions of the present invention are also useful especially for treating and/or preventing gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds or combination compositions of the present invention are efficacious for treatment of diabetes mellitus. One outcome of the treatment may be decreasing the glucose level in a subject with elevated glucose levels. Another outcome of the treatment may be decreasing insulin levels in a subject with elevated insulin levels. Another outcome of the treatment is decreasing plasma triglycerides in a subject with elevated plasma triglycerides. Another outcome of the treatment is decreasing LDL cholesterol in a subject with high LDL cholesterol levels. Another outcome of the treatment is increasing HDL cholesterol in a subject with low HDL cholesterol levels. Another outcome of the treatment is increasing insulin sensitivity. Another outcome of the treatment may be enhancing glucose tolerance in a subject with abnormal glucose tolerance. Another outcome of the treatment may be decreasing insulin resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds or combination compositions of the present invention are efficacious for prevention of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hypertension” as used herein includes essential hypertension wherein the cause is not known or where hypertension is due to at least one cause, such as changes in both the heart and blood vessels; and secondary hypertension wherein the cause is known. Causes of secondary hypertension include, but are not limited to, obesity; kidney disease; hormonal disorders; use of certain drugs, such as oral contraceptives, adrenocorticosteroids, cyclosporines, and the like. The term “hypertension” includes high blood pressure, in which both the systolic and diastolic pressure levels are elevated, and isolated systolic hypertension, in which only the systolic pressure is elevated to greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg, while the diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. One outcome of treatment is decreasing blood pressure in a subject with high blood pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipidosis or disorders of lipid metabolism, include various conditions characterized by abnormal concentrations of one or more lipids (for example, cholesterol and triglycerides), and/or apolipoproteins (for example, apolipoproteins A, B, C and E), and/or lipoproteins (for example, macromolecular complexes formed by the lipid and the apolipoprotein that allow lipids to circulate in blood, such as LDL, VLDL and IDL). Hyperlipidemia is associated with abnormally high levels of lipids, LDL and VLDL cholesterol, and/or triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “metabolic syndrome,” also known as syndrome X, is denned in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP-III) [E. S. Ford et al., JAMA, vol. 287 (3), Jan. 16, 2002, pp 356-359]. Briefly, a person is defined as having metabolic syndrome if the person has three or more of the following symptoms: abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. The criteria for these are defined in ATP-III.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “left ventricular hypertrophy” (LVH) as used herein includes three patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy that have been identified based on left ventricular mass index [LVMI=left ventricular mass (g) divided by body surface area (m\n2\n)] and relative wall thickness (RWT=2× posterior wall thickness/left ventricular end diastolic diameter). The three patterns means: concentric LVH which is typically exemplified by a left ventricular mass index of 144 and a relative wall thickness of 0.52; eccentric LVH which is typically exemplified by a left ventricular mass index of 136 and a relative wall thickness of 0.38; and concentric left ventricular remodeling which is typically exemplified by a LVMI of 93 and a relative wall thickness of 0.38. Normal LVMI is typically 85, and normal RWT is typically about 0.36. Patients with concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling have a cardiovascular risk intermediate between those with normal left ventricular structure and those with left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in ventricular mass. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in the rate of increase of ventricular mass. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in ventricular wall thickness. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in the rate of increase in ventricular wall thickness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “obesity” as used herein is a condition in which there is an excess of body fat. The definition of obesity is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated as body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m\n2\n). In Europe and the U.S.A., “obesity” refers to a condition whereby a healthy subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a condition whereby a subject with at least one complication has a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m\n2\n. A “subject at risk of obesity” refers to a healthy subject with a BMI of 25 kg/m\n2 \nor more but less than 30 kg/m\n2 \nor a subject with at least one complication with a BMI of 25 kg/m\n2 \nor more but less than 27 kg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe risks associated with obesity occur at a low Body Mass Index (BMI) in Asians, compared to that in Westerners. In Asian countries, including Japan, “obesity” refers to a condition whereby a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related complication, that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m\n2\n. In Asian countries, a “subject at risk of obesity” is a subject with a BMI of 23 kg/m\n2 \nor more but less than 25 kg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “obesity” is meant to encompass all of the above definitions of obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity-induced or obesity-related complications include, but are not limited to, diabetes mellitus, abnormal glucose tolerance, insulin-resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperuricemia, gout, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty liver, cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, degenerative arthritis, lumbago, emmeniopathy and infertility. In particular, complications include: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, abnormal glucose tolerance, cardiovascular diseases, sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus and other obesity-related conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of obesity and obesity-related disorders refers to the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of an obese patient. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the body weight of an obese patient relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions according to the present invention. Another outcome of treatment may be maintaining body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of obesity-related diseases. The treatment may result in a reduction in food and/or calorie intake, including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of intake of specific components of the diet such as carbohydrates or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate. The treatment may also result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate or an increase in metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of the metabolic resistance that typically results from weight loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevention of obesity and obesity-related disorders refers to the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity. One outcome of prevention may be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity relative to subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions according to the present invention. Another outcome of prevention may be maintaining body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Another outcome of prevention may be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity of obesity-related disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment may prevent the occurrence and progression or reduce severity of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, degenerative arthritis, dermatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and gallstone disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “atherosclerosis” as used herein includes vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vasodilatation diseases are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and are therefore encompassed by the terms “atherosclerosis” and “atherosclerotic disease.” The composition of a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-obesity agent in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-diabetic agent may be administered to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence or recurrence, of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or intermittent claudication. Coronary heart disease events are intended to include CHD death, myocardial infarction (such as heart attack) and revascularization procedures. Cerebrovascular events are intended to include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accidents) and transient ischemic attacks. Intermittent claudication is a clinical manifestation of peripheral vessel disease. The term “atherosclerotic disease event” as used herein is intended to encompass coronary heart disease events, cerebrovascular events and intermittent claudication. It is intended that persons who have previously experienced one or more non-fatal atherosclerotic disease events are those for whom the potential for recurrence of such an event exists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCircadian rhythms affect physiological parameters. Physiological parameters include rest-activity, sleep-wake cycles, body temperature, rhythms in hormone levels, and oscillations in general physiology. When these parameters are out of synchrony with the daily clock, a circadian rhythm imbalance occurs which can affect physiology, performance on a variety of tasks and one's emotional well being. The present invention is useful, for example, in the prevention or treatment of conditions associated with circadian rhythmicity as well as mental and physical disorders associated with travel across time zones and with rotating shift-work schedules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the prevention or treatment of a circadian rhythm disorder in a mammal, including syndrome, shift-work sleep disorder, delayed sleep-phase syndrome, advanced sleep-phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for shortening the time of re-entrainment (return to normal entrainment of the circadian rhythms; synchronized to the environmental light-dark cycle) in a subject following an irregular shift in the sleep-wake cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for alleviating the effects of jet lag in a traveler. The purpose of this embodiment is to assist the body to adjust physiologically to the changes in sleep and eating patterns when crossing several time zones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for resetting the internal circadian clock in a patient to match the patient's current activity/sleep cycle. For example, such a method is effective for shift workers changing from a day to a night shift or vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method for enhancing or improving sleep quality by increasing sleep efficiency and augmenting sleep maintenance. In addition, the present invention provides a method for preventing and treating sleep disorders and sleep disturbances. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for enhancing or improving sleep quality and increasing sleep efficiency and sleep stability. The present invention is useful for the treatment of sleep disorders, including Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining Sleep (insomnias) (“DIMS”) which can arise from psychophysiological causes, as a consequence of psychiatric disorders (particularly related to anxiety), from drugs and alcohol use and abuse (particularly during drug and alcohol withdrawal stages), childhood onset DIMS, nocturnal myoclonus and restless legs and non specific REM (eye movement) disturbances as seen in ageing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following outcomes in a patient which are provided by the present invention may be related to improvement in sleep quality: an increase in value which is calculated from the time that a subject actually sleeps divided by the time that a subject is attempting to sleep; a decrease in sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep); a decrease in the number of awakenings during sleep; a decrease in the time spent awake following the initial onset of sleep; an increase in the total amount of sleep; an increase the amount and percentage of REM sleep; an increase in the duration and occurrence of REM sleep; a reduction in the fragmentation of REM sleep; an increase in the amount and percentage of slow-wave (for example, stage 3 or 4) sleep; an increase in the amount and percentage of stage 2 sleep; a decrease in the number of awakenings, especially in the early morning; an increase in daytime alertness; and increased sleep stability. Secondary outcomes which may be provided by the present invention include enhanced cognitive function and increased memory retention. “Method for enhancing the quality of sleeps” refers to a method that results in outcomes in a patient which may be related to enhancement in sleep quality, including, but not limited to, the outcomes correlated to enhancement of sleep quality as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further useful for the prevention and treatment of sleep disorders and sleep disturbances including sleep problems associated with insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy, nocturnal myoclonus, REM sleep interruptions, jet-lag, shift workers' sleep disturbances, dysomnias, noctiphobia, night eating syndrome, insomnias associated with depression or with emotional/mood disorders, dysfunctions associated with sleep (parasomnias), as well as sleep walking and enuresis, as well as sleep disorders which accompany aging. Sleep disorders and sleep disturbances are generally characterized by difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or in obtaining restful or enough sleep.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain drugs may also cause reductions in REM sleep as a side effect and the present invention may be used to correct those types of sleeping disorders as well. The present invention would also be of benefit in the treatment of syndromes such as fibromyalgia which are manifested by non-restorative sleep and muscle pain or sleep apnea which is associated with respiratory disturbances during sleep. It will be clear that the present invention is not limited to just sleep disorders and sleep disturbances, but is applicable to a wide variety of conditions which result from a diminished quality of sleep.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention and compositions thereof, or combinations of these and other drugs, are useful for treating and preventing these conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, a subject mammal is preferably a human. Although the present invention is applicable for both old and young people, it may find greater application in elderly people. Further, although the invention may be employed to enhance the sleep of healthy people, it may be especially beneficial for enhancing the sleep quality of people suffering from sleep disorders or sleep disturbances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions according to the present invention may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment, prevention or control of disorders, such as hypertension, hypertension associated with obesity, hypertension-related disorders, cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and metabolic syndrome, obesity and obesity-related disorders. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefore, concurrently or sequentially with a composition according to the present invention. When a composition of the present invention is used concurrently with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the composition of the present invention is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the composition according to the present invention and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping dosage schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the composition according to the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a composition of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a composition according to the present invention, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) anti-diabetic agents such as (i) PPARγ agonists such as glitazones (for example ciglitazone, darglitazone, englitazone, isaglitazone (MCC-555), pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone, BRL49653, CLX-0921 and 5-BTZD), GW-0207, LG-100641 and LY-300512;

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel pharmacologically active benzimidazolone derivatives and their addicton salts which bind the serotonine and dopamine receptors, to their preparation and their use for therapeutic purposes. These compounds, owing to their pharmacological activity, are useful in the treatment of CNS disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSerotonine (5-HT) recognises several well defined cell surface receptors. Among these, 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n2A \nat which serotonine have high affinity, are known to be implicated in many Central Nervous System disorders such as sexual disorders, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, Parkinson and neurodegenerative diseases (EP 0 526 434 B1; WO 01/21593 A1; WO 02/24661 A2; WO 02/24662 A1; WO 03/014079 A1; WO 03/013539 A1; WO 03/035072 A1; WO 05/102343 A1; WO 06/019715 A1; WO 06/010574 A1; WO 06/024471 A1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the previous art, several classes of compounds able to interfere with the neurotransmission at serotonine or dopamine receptor subtypes are known. Particularly, derivatives based on the core structure of the arylpiperazine and benzimidazolone have been described (e.g. GB 2023594, U.S. Pat. No. 3,472,854, U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,503 and WO 98/33784), and targeted both to generic serotonine or dopamine receptors and to a specific receptor subtype. In another patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,318) compounds based both on the benzimidazolone and phenyl piperazine structures are described: in this latter case the described affinities are limited to 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor subtypes. Further compounds with affinity to 5-HT recptors and their synthesis have been disclosed in WO 01/21593 A1.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nHere we describe, and this is one object of the present invention, new sulfate esters based on the benzimidazolone phenyl piperazine structure. Surprisingly it was discovered that the compounds according to this invention possess an interesting affinity profile at the said serotonine receptor subtypes: indeed, some of them have a high and preferential affinity at a given site (e.g. 5-HT\n1A \nor 5-HT\n2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOwing to their peculiar profile, the present compounds may play a role in the regulation of neurotransmission at the serotonine sites and thus may be of value in the treatment of those diseases where an altered functioning of neurosignal transmission is present. Examples of these CNS disorders include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson, anxiety, sleep disturbances, sexual and mental disorders and age associated memory impairment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, we provide compounds of general formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4 \ndenote hydrogen or sulfate monoester with the proviso that R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4 \ncannot simultaneously represent hydrogen.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds according to the invention are those of general formula (I) wherein two or three of the four radicals R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4 \ndenote hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso preferred are compounds of general formula (I) wherein one of the radicals R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4 \ndenotes sulfate, whilst the other radicals represent hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest are compounds selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the compounds represented by formula (I) may exist also as the corresponding zwitter ion form and that while both forms are included within the meaning of the structural formula, for simplicity sake, only the free acid form is shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the pharmaceutical use the compounds of general formula (I) may be used also in the form of pharmacologically acceptable salts. As used herein, “acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic base salts of acidic residues such as sulfuric acid monoesters and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, gluconic, isethionic, glycinic, mucoic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like. Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts and examples are the lithium, sodium, potassium, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, choline, arginine, glycine, procaine, tromethamine, benzathine, lysine and meglumine salts (also see Pharmaceutical salts, Berge, S. M. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., (1977), 66, 1-19).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacologically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmacologically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the light of the pharmaceutical efficacy of the compounds of formula (I), the present invention furthermore relates to the use of those compounds as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of compounds of formula (I), optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for treating diseases in which the use of compounds displaying affinity for the 5-HT\n1A\n, and 5-HT\n2\n-receptor may have a therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of the one or more compounds of formula (I) selected from the group consisting of compound (I.a), (I.b), (I.c), (I.d), (I.e), (I.f), (I.g), (I.h), (I.i), (I.j), (I.k) and (I.l), most preferably the use of the compound of formula (I.b), optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of a medicament for treating diseases in which the use of compounds displaying affinity for the 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n2\n-receptor may have a therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to the use of one or more of the compounds of formula (I), more preferably to the use of one or more compounds of formula (I.a), (I.b), (I.c), (I.d), (I.e), (I.f), (I.g), (I.h), (I.i), (I.j), (I.k) and (I.l), most preferably the use of the compound of formula (I.b), optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of sexual disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe generic term “Sexual disorders” includes Sexual Desire Disorders (i.e. Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Sexual Aversion Disorder), Sexual Arousal Disorders (i.e. Female Sexual Arousal Disorder, Male Erectile Disorder), Orgasmic Disorders (i.e. Female Orgasmic Disorder, Male Orgasmic Disorder, Premature Ejaculation) Sexual Pain Disorders (i.e. Dyspareunia, Vaginismus), Sexual Dysfunction due to a General Medical Condition, Substance-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, and Sexual Dysfunction not otherwise specified (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision.

The composition may, for example, be presented in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral administration or for nasal inhalation: preferred forms includes for example, capsules, tablets, coated tablets, ampoules, suppositories and nasal spray.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredient may be incorporated in excipients or carriers conventionally used in pharmaceutical compositions such as, for example, talc, arabic gum, lactose, gelatine, magnesium stearate, corn starch, aqueous or non aqueous vehicles, polyvynil pyrrolidone, semisynthetic glicerides of fatty acids, benzalconium chloride, sodium phosphate, EDTA, polysorbate 80.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn case it is desired to further increase the solubilty of the compounds of general formula (I) or of their physiologically acceptable salts, surfactants, non ionic surfactants such as PEG 400, cyclodextrin, metastable polymorphs, inert adsorbents such as bentonite, may be incorporated. Furthermore some techniques may be employed by preparing for example eutectic mixtures and/or solid dispersion by using mannitol, sorbitol, saccharose, succinic acid or physical modified forms by using hydrosoluble polymers, PVP, PEG 4000-20.000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions are advantageously formulated in dosage units, each dosage unit being adapted to supply a single dose of the active ingredient.

It is preferred that the compounds of the invention be administered either three or fewer times, more preferably once or twice daily consecutively over a period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable tablets may be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance(s) with known excipients, for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatine, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc and/or agents for delaying release, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets may also comprise several layers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. To achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers. Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number or layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups or elixirs containing the active substances or combinations thereof according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharine, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanilline or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions for injection are prepared in the usual way, e.g. with the addition of preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates, or stabilisers such as alkali metal salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and transferred into injection vials or ampoules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or polyethyleneglycol or the derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of general formula (I) can be conveniently prepared by a variety of synthetic routes known to those skilled in the art. According to a further object of the present invention, processes for the preparation of compounds of general formula (I) are provided, in which:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) a compound of general formula (II)\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \ndenote hydroxy or hydrogen and at least one among R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis hydroxy, is reacted with a sulfation reagent such as sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, sulfur trioxide in the presence of organic bases or amides or tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogensulfate in combination with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The synthesis of the compounds according to formula (II) has been described in WO 01/21593 A1, page 7 line 17 to page 14, line 34.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred reagents are sulfur trioxide in the presence of tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine or pyridine, or sulfur trioxide in the presence of dimethylformamide and combinations thereof. Particularly preferred reagent is sulfur trioxide complexed with dimethylformamide in the presence of pyridine. The reaction can be conveniently carried out at temperature ranging from 10 to 50° C. under stirring, preferably between 20 and 50° C., most preferably at 40° C., or\n\n \n \n \n \n \nb) a compound of general formula (III)\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \ndenote protected sulfate monoester or hydrogen and at least one among R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis a protected sulfate monoester, is reacted with a cleavage reagent to restore the free acid moiety (see: Gunnarson G T et al. Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, 13 (2005) 1783-1789; Simpson L S, Journal of the American Chemical Society 128 (2006) 1605-1610). Protecting groups for sulfates are represented by alkyl and halogenated alkyls, preferably isobutyl, neopentyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethyl. In case the protecting group is alkyl, the protected sulfates can be cleaved with nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents. Examples of nucleophiles are azide, cyanide, iodide and thiocianate; as solvents dimethylformamide and acetone can be conveniently used. The reaction can be conveniently carried out in warm solvents, preferably between 50 and 70° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtected sulfates of general formula (III) can be conveniently prepared by reacting a compound of general formula (II), wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \ndenote hydroxy or hydrogen and at least one among R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis hydroxy, with suitable alkylchlorosulfates or halogenated alkylchlorosulfates in the presence of a base in an aprotic solvent. Examples of alkylchorosulfates are isobutylchlorosulfate and neopentylchlorosulfate, example of halogenated alkylchlorosulfate is 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chorosulfate. As bases, organic or inorganic bases can be used: non imitative examples are: dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, DBU, sodium hydride, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, etc. As solvent, tetrahydrofurane can be conveniently used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized by enzymatic processes using S9 fractions from human or animal livers as the source of sulfotransferases and adenosine-3′-phosphate-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulphate donor (Foldes A, Meek J L, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 327:365-374, 1973; Honma W et al., drug Metabolism and Disposition 30: 944-949, 2002; Wang Q et al. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Animal 41: 97-103, 2005). A typical incubation mixture consists of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM PAPS, human or animal (rat, dog, monkey) liver S9 fraction (commercially available) adjusted to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/mL and of 10-1000 of a compound of general formula (II) as the substrate. The reaction is initiated by the addition of PAPS and terminated by the addition of 4 times the volume of ice-cold acetonitrile after incubation at 37° C. for 2 to 8 hours depending on the substrate molecule. The mixture is centrifuged to sediment the precipitated protein. The supernatant containing the compound sulphate is concentrated under a stream of nitrogen, re-suspended in water and purified by liquid chromatography using a C18 separating column (100×4.6 mm ID, ProC18, YMC, Schermbeck, Germany) protected by a guard column (15×4 mm ID, Purosphere E, C18, Merck, Germany) and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A linear gradient (mobile phase A: 0.1° A) HCOOH and 10% ACN in water, mobile phase B: 0.1% HCOOH and 75% ACN in water) where ACN concentration increases from 10 to 75% within 25 minutes can be used to separate the sulphate from impurities. The identity of the purified sulphate can be verified by HPLC (mobile phase: 0.1% ammonium formiate, pH 3.3 and 70° A) acetonitrile in water, 0.3 mL/min flow rate) interfaced to an electrospray (positive) ionization tandem mass spectrometry (API 365, Perkin-Elmer-Sciex, Canada) using a pneumatically assisted electrospray ionisation source. The structure is verified by fragmentation of the [M+H]+ ion (m/z 583). The consecutive loss of 2 SO3 moieties (−80 amu, respectively) leads to the key fragment C (m/z 423). At higher collision energies fragment m/z 177 (hydroxylated benzimidazolone sturucture) is also observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned before, the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention, surprisingly show interesting pharmacological properties owing to their different profile at the serotonine or dopamine receptor subtypes, such as 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n2A\n. The biochemical profile of the compounds was assessed by evaluating their affinity for the 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n2A \nreceptors, according to the methods described below.\n\n\n \nReceptor Binding Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding studies can be carried out to determine the affinity of the compounds for 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n2A \nreceptors\n\n\n \n5-HT\n1A \nReceptor\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman recombinant CHO-K1 cells are used.

Martin G R and Humphrey P P A Neuropharmacol. 33:261, 1994). The assays are terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over glass fiber filters.

It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the given examples of chemical methods and processes for the preparation of the substances, as other conventional methods well known to those skilled in the art, are suitable too.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n{2-oxo-3-{2-[4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl}mono sulfuric acid ester\n\n\n \n \n \n6-Hydroxy-1-{2-[4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2-one (2.0 g; 4.9 mmol) is dissolved in pyridine (10 ml) in a round bottom flask under stirring. Sulfur trioxide dimethylformamide complex (3.8 g, 24.2 mmol) dissolved in pyridine (4 ml) is added at room temperature; then the mixture is warmed to 40° C. until a suspension is formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction mixture is evaporated under vacuum to remove most of the liquid. The almost solid residue is taken up in 1:1 mixture of ethylether and ethylacetate, then triturated and filtered through fritted glass. The residual solid is repeatedly washed with water and finally with ethyl ether. Upon drying, the title compound is obtained as solid, 1.48 g;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nm.p. 262-264° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other sulfates can be prepared by the outlined procedure from the corresponding hydroxy derivatives described in WO 01/21593 A1 on page 2 line 13 to 29. Those hydroxy derivatives can be synthesized as described in WO 01/21593 A1, page 7 line 17 to page 14, line 34.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\n5-Methoxy-1-{2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2-one\n\n\ni) N-(4-Methoxy-2-nitro-phenyl)-2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]acetamide\n\n\n \n \n \n2-Bromo-N-(4-methoxy-2-nitro-phenyl)-acetamide (6.7 g; 19.6 mmol) is dissolved in 200 ml ethanol in the presence of 6.3 g sodium carbonate. 1-(4-Methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine hydrochloride (5.8 g; 19.6 mmol) is added to the resulting suspension and the mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture is evaporated to dryness under vacuum and the residue is taken up with water and ethylacetate. The organic phase is separated and washed twice with water. After drying over magnesium sulfate, evaporation of the solvent leaves a residue which is triturated with ethylether.\n\n\n \nii) 2-Amino-4-methoxy-N-{2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-aniline\n\n\n \n \n \nN-(4-Methoxy-2-nitro-phenyl)-2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]acetamide (6.1 g; 11 mmol) iss dissolved in 70 ml tetrahydrofurane. Borane-tetrahydrofurane complex (90 ml of 1M THF solution) is added at 10° C. and the mixture is warmed to 55° C. for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent is evaporated under vacuum and the residue is taken with ethanol and acidified with hydrochloric acid. Heating to 50° C. takes place for 60 min. Upon overnight cooling, the unreacted compound is separated by filtration. The liquid phase is dried under vacuum, taken up with water and, after removal of the undissolved solid, saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution is added. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethylacetate and the organic layer is dessicated prior to evaporation. The residue is purified by silicagel chromatography (methylene chloride/methanol/32% aqueous ammonia 95:5:0.5). The title compound can be directly used for the following step.\n\n\n \niii) 5-Methoxy-1-{2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2-one\n\n\n \n \n \n2-Amino-4-methoxy-N-{2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-aniline (2.5 g, 6 mmol) is dissolved in 30 ml tetrahydrofurane; 1.5 g (9 mmol) carbonyldiimidazole is added portionwise to the resulting solution. The mixture is left at room temperature under stirring for 24 h. After evaporation to dryness, the residue is purified by silicagel chromatography (methylene chloride/methanol/32% aqueous ammonia 95:5:0.5). The crude title compound is triturated with ethylether.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\n1-{2-[4-(2-Methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethtl}-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2-one\n\n\n \n \n \n1-(2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine hydrochloride (1.2 g; 4.0 mmol) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2-one (0.81 g; 4.2 mmol) are dissolved in 10 ml dimethylformamide in the presence of 0.56 g potassium carbonate. The mixture is heated to 100° C. for 8 hours. After cooling, it is partitioned between 50 ml water and 30 ml ethylacetate; the aqueous phase is extracted once more with ethylacetate. The organic layer is washed with 5% hydrochloric acid and with water. The organic layer is dried and evaporated under vacuum. The residue is triturated with ethylacetate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe deprotection of the hydroxy groups of the compounds described in Example 2) and 3) can easily carried out by conventional known procedures e.g. as described in WO 01/21593 A1. For example, the deprotection can be achieved by treatment with strong aqueous acids such as 48% hydrobromic acid at high temperatures or alternatively by treatment with boron derivatives such as BBr\n3\n, at low temperatures in chlorurated solvents such as methylene chloride. The resulting deprotected hydroxy-derivatives can be easily converted to the corresponding disulfate ester as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \nExamples of Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA)\n\n\nTablets\n\n\nper tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncompound (I.a)\n\n\n100 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlactose\n\n\n240 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncorn starch\n\n\n340 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npolyvinylpyrrolidone\n\n\n 45 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmagnesium stearate\n\n\n 15 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n740 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe finely ground active substance, lactose and some of the corn starch are mixed together.

No. 60/812,077, filed on Jun. 9, 2006, and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to sodium channel blockers possessing beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity. The present invention also includes a variety of methods of treatment using these inventive sodium channel blockers/beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of the Background\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mucosal surfaces at the interface between the environment and the body have evolved a number of “innate defenses”, i.e., protective mechanisms. A principal form of such an innate defense is to cleanse these surfaces with liquid. Typically, the quantity of the liquid layer on a mucosal surface reflects the balance between epithelial liquid secretion, often reflecting anion (Cl\n− \nand/or HCO\n3\n \n−\n) secretion coupled with water (and a cation counter-ion) and epithelial liquid absorption, often reflecting Na\n+ \nabsorption, coupled with water and counter anion (Cl\n− \nand/or HCO\n3\n \n−\n). Many diseases of mucosal surfaces are caused by too little protective liquid on those mucosal surfaces created by an imbalance between secretion (too little) and absorption (relatively too much). The defective salt transport processes that characterize these mucosal dysfunctions reside in the epithelial layer of the mucosal surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne approach to replenish the protective liquid layer on mucosal surfaces is to “re-balance” the system by blocking Na\n+ \nchannel and liquid absorption and simultaneously activating beta-adrenergic receptors thereby causing liquid secretion. The epithelial protein that mediates the rate-limiting step of Na\n+ \nand liquid absorption is the epithelial Na\n+ \nchannel (ENaC). ENaC and beta-adrenergic receptors are positioned on the apical surface of the epithelium, i.e. the mucosal surface-extermal environment interface. Therefore, to inhibit ENaC mediated Na\n+\n and liquid absorption, an ENaC blocker of the amiloride class (which blocks from the extracellular domain of ENaC) must be delivered to the mucosal surface and, importantly, be maintained at this site, to achieve therapeutic utility. The present invention describes diseases characterized by too little liquid on mucosal surfaces and “topical” sodium channel blockers containing beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity designed to exhibit the increased potency, reduced mucosal absorption, and slow dissociation (“unbinding” or detachment) from ENaC and the beta-adrenergic receptor required for therapy of these diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic bronchitis (CB), including the most common lethal genetic form of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis (CF), are diseases that reflect the body's failure to clear mucus normally from the lungs, which ultimately produces chronic airways infection. In the normal lung, the primary defense against chronic intrapulmonary airways infection (chronic bronchitis) is mediated by the continuous clearance of mucus from bronchial airway surfaces. This function in health subjects effectively removes from the lung potentially noxious toxins and pathogens. Recent data indicate that the initiating problem, i.e., the “basic defect,” in both CB and CF is the failure to clear mucus from airway surfaces. The failure to clear mucus reflects an imbalance between the amount of liquid and mucin on airway surfaces. This “airway surface liquid” (ASL) is primarily composed of salt and water in proportions similar to plasma (i.e., isotonic). Mucin macromolecules are organized into a well defined “mucus layer” which normally traps inhaled bacteria and are transported out of the lung via the actions of cilia which beat in a watery, low viscosity solution termed the “periciliary liquid” (PCL). In the disease state, there is an imbalance in the quantities of mucus and ASL on airway surfaces. This imbalance results in a relative reduction in ASL which leads to mucus concentration, a reduction in the lubricant activity of the PCL, and a failure to clear mucus via ciliary activity to the mouth. The reduction in mechanical clearance of mucus from the lung leads to chronic bacterial colonization of mucus adherent to airway surfaces. It is the chronic retention of bacteria, the failure of local antimicrobial substances to kill mucus-entrapped bacteria on a chronic basis, and the consequent chronic inflammatory responses of the body to this type of surface infection, that lead to the syndromes of CB and CF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current afflicted population in the U.S. is 12,000,000 patients with the acquired (primarily from cigarette smoke exposure) form of chronic bronchitis and approximately 30,000 patients with the genetic form, cystic fibrosis. Approximately equal numbers of both populations are present in Europe. In Asia, there is little CF but the incidence of CB is high and, like the rest of the world, is increasing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is currently a large, unmet medical need for products that specifically treat CB and CF at the level of the basic defect that cause these diseases. The current therapies for chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis focus on treating the symptoms and/or the late effects of these diseases. Thus, for chronic bronchitis, inhaled β-agonists, steroids, anti-cholinergic agents, and oral theophyilines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are all in current use. However, none of these drugs alone effectively treat the fundamental problem of the failure to clear mucus from the lung. Similarly, in cystic fibrosis, the same spectrum of pharmacologic agents are used. These strategies have been complemented by more recent strategies designed to clear the CF lung of the DNA (“Pulmozyme”; Genentech) that has been deposited in the lung by neutrophils that have futilely attempted to kill the bacteria that grow in adherent mucus masses and through the use of inhaled antibiotics (e. “TOBI”) designed to augment the lungs' own killing mechanisms to rid the adherent mucus plaques of bacteria. A general principle of the body is that if the initiating lesion is not treated, in this case mucus retention/obstruction, bacterial infections become chronic and increasingly refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Thus, a major unmet therapeutic need for both CB and CF lung diseases is an effective means of re-hydrating airway mucus restoring/expanding the volume of the ASL) and promoting its clearance, with bacteria, from the lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR. C. Boucher, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,975, describes the use of pyrazinoylguanidine sodium channel blockers for hydrating mucosal surfaces. These compounds, typified by the well-known diuretics amiloride, benzamil, and phenamil, are effective. However; these compounds suffer from the significant disadvantage that they are (1) relatively impotent, which is important because the mass of drug that can be inhaled by the lung is limited; (2) rapidly absorbed, which limits the half-life of the drug on the mucosal surface; and (3) are freely dissociable from ENaC. The sum of these disadvantages embodied in these well known diurectics produces compounds with insufficient potency and/or effective half-life on mucosal surfaces to have therapeutic benefit for hydrating mucosal surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClearly, what is needed are drugs that are more effective at restoring the clearance of mucus from the lungs of patients with CB/CF. The value of these new therapies will be reflected in improvements in the quality and duration of life for both the CF and the CB populations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther mucosal surfaces in and on the body exhibit subtle differences in the normal physiology of the protective surface liquids on their surfaces but the pathophysiology of disease reflects a common theme, i.e., too little protective surface liquid. For example, in xerostomia (dry mouth) the oral cavity is depleted of liquid due to a failure of the parotid sublingual and submandibular glands to secrete liquid despite continued Na\n+ \n(ENaC) transport mediated liquid absorption from the oral cavity. Similarly, keratoconjunctivitis sira (dry eye) is caused by failure of lacrimal glands to secrete liquid in the face of continued Na\n+\n dependent liquid absorption on conjunctional surfaces. In rhinosinusitis, there is an imbalance, as in CB, between mucin secretion and relative ASL depletion. Finally, in the gastrointestinal tract, failure to secrete Cl- (and liquid) in the proximal small intestine, combined with increased Na\n+\n (and liquid) absorption in the terminal ileum leads to the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In older patients, excessive Na\n+ \n(and volume) absorption in the descending colon produces chronic constipation and diverticulitis.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that have both sodium channel blocking activity and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity in the same molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, and/or are less reversible as compared to known compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another aspect of the present invention to provide compounds that are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly and/or exhibit less reversibility, as compared to compounds such as amilorde, benzamil, and phenamil. Therefore, the compounds will give a prolonged pharmacodynamic half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to known compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of the present invention to provide compounds which are (1) absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, especially airway surfaces, as compared to known compounds and; (2) when absorbed from musosal surfaces after administration to the mucosal surfaces, are converted in vivo into metabolic derivatives thereof which have reduced efficacy in blocking sodium channels and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity as compared to the administered parent compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of the present invention to provide compounds that are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly and/or exhibit less reversibility, as compared to compounds such as amiloride, benzamil, and phenamil. Therefore, such compounds will give a prolonged pharmacodynamic half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to previous compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of the present invention to provide methods of treatment that take advantage of the pharmacological properties of the compounds described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods of treatment which rely on rehydration of mucosal surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the compounds described herein can be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and wherein the above compounds are inclusive of all racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs thereof. Polymorphs are different physical forms—different crystal forms that have differing melting ranges, show differing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tracings and exhibit different X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra. Pseudopolymorphs are different solvated physical forms—different crystal forms that have differing melting ranges as solvates, show differing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tracings as solvates and exhibit different X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra as solvates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which contain a compound described

Therefore, the compounds of formula (I) have a longer half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also based on the discovery that certain compounds embraced by formula (I) are converted in vivo into metabolic derivatives thereof that have reduced efficacy in blocking sodium channels and acting as beta-adrenergic receptor agonists as compared to the parent administered compound, after they are absorbed from mucosal surfaces after administration. This important property means that the compounds will have a lower tendency to cause undesired side-effects by blocking sodium channels and activating beta-receptors located at other untargeted locations in the body of the recipient, e in the kidneys and heart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMono drug therapy leaves most major diseases such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis inadequately treated. It is therefore often necessary to discover and develop novel drugs or combination of drugs which treat and modulate multiple targets simultaneously (polypharmacology) with the goal of enhancing efficacy or improving safety relative to single target drugs. There are three possible ways to achieve this. 1) Combining therapeutic “cocktails” of two or more individual drugs; the benefits of this approach are often lessened by poor patient compliance. 2). A multiple component drug (“fixed combination” or multiple component drug) that contains two or more agents in a single tablet, liquid formulation, inhaler or dry powder device. This can sometimes improve patient compliance versus multiple component drugs but adds the complexity of carefully dosing so as to minimize multiple metabolic pathways. 3). A single molecular entity which can simultaneously modulate multiple drug targets (designed multiple ligands). The advantage of a multiple ligand over the first two approaches is that it improves compliance, enhances efficacy, it targets a known set of deficiencies in multiple systems with a single new chemical entity, it often lacks the unpredictable differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability between patients, it is often easier to formulate and potentially lowers the risk of drug-drug interactions compared to drug cocktails and multiple component drugs. It was therefore our goal to discover multiple ligands that have both sodium channel blockinv activity as well as beta agonist activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe addition of beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity to a sodium channel blocker will significantly increase the capacity to hydrate airway surfaces in subjects in need of hydration for therapeutic purposes. The mechanism by which beta-agonist activity adds to the hydration capacity of Na channel blockers alone, or beta-agonists alone, is described in the following diagrams that describe the electrochemical gradients for ion flows and the net secretion that results from these forces in airway epithelia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 1\n, under baseline conditions human airway epithelia absorb NaCl and H\n2\nO. Active Na\n+ \nabsorption drives this process. Cl\n− \nis absorbed passively with Na\n+ \nto preserve electroneutrality. As there is no net driving force for Cl\n− \nto move across the apical cell membrane, Cl\n− \nis absorbed paracellularly in response to the transepithelial electric potential. Water moves cellularly and paracellularly in response to the osmotic gradients generated by NaCl absorption.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplication of a Na\n+ \nchannel blocker (as an example amiloride is shown) inhibits the entry of Na\n+ \ninto the cell which: (1) abolishes Na\n+ \nabsorption and (2) hyperpolarizes the apical cell membrane (Va). The hyperpolarization of Va generates an electrochemical driving force favoring Cl\n− \nsecretion Na\n+ \nnow follows in the secretory direction via the paracellular path). The rate of Cl\n− \nsecretion is proportional to the activity of the apical membrane ci channels which are typically 30-50% maximally active under basal conditions. In summary, application of a Na\n+ \nchannel blocker inhibits Na\n+ \nabsorption and triggers a modest amount of secretion. Note again that water will follow transcellularly in response to the secreted NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, as depicted in \nFIG. 2\n, addition of a beta-agonist (as an example isoproterenol is shown) alone to human airway epithelia produces no changes in Na\n+ \nabsorption or Cl\n− \nsecretion. The reason for this absence of effect is that there is no electrochemical driving force for to move across the cell (See the following references: Intracellular Cl- activity and cellular Cl- pathways in cultured human airway epithelium.

Physiol. 1989 May; 256 (5 Pt 1):C1045-53. Willumsen N J, Davis C W, Boucher R C Activation of an apical Cl- conductance by Ca2+ ionophores in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. Am J. Physiol. 1989 February; 256 (2 Pt 1):C226-33. Willumsen N J, Boucher R C). Thus, a beta-agonist mediated activation of an apical membrane Cl\n− \nchannel, usually CFTR via changes in cAMP, produces no change in the rate of movement of Cl\n− \nacross the barrier and, hence, no change in transepithelial sodium chloride or water secretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, when a Na channel blocker is administered with a beta-agonist, additivity between these two classes of compounds is achieved with the result being accelerated Cl\n− \n(and Na\n+\n, H\n2\nO) secretion. The mechanism underlying the additivity is shown in \nFIG. 3\n. In the presence of a Na channel blocker, an electrochemical gradient for CF secretion is generated (also see \nFIG. 1\n). Now when a beta-agonist is present, it converts the apical membrane CFTR from ˜30% basal activity to ˜100% activity via beta-agonist induced increase in cAMP that ultimately activates CFTR via PKA (protein kinase A). Because there is an electrochemical driving force favoring Cl\n− \nsecretion as a result of ENaC blockade, the increase in Cl\n− \nchannel activity translates into increasing Cl\n− \n(and Na\n+\n, H\n2\nO) secretion. Thus, the hydration capacity of the epithelia is greatly enhanced by the presence of both Na\n+ \nchannel blocker and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activities in the environment bathing the human airway epithelia as compared to just Na\n+ \nchannel blocker or beta-adrenergic receptor agonist by themselves. A discovery of this invention is that administration of both activities contained within the same molecule to the epithelium is at least as effective as sequential administration of a Na channel blocker followed by a beta-agonist and therefore has the advantages cited earlier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I exist primarily as a combination of the three tautomers shown \nFIG. 4\n, \nFIG. 4\n shows the three tautomers represented in formula I that exist in solution. Previous studies by Smith et al. have shown that the free base exists primarily as the acylimino tautomer, whereas the physiologically active species exists as the protonated form of the acylamino tautomer (\nFIG. 1\n, ref R L Smith et. Al. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1979, 101, 191-201). These structural representations have been used to represent amiloride and its analogs in both the patent and scientific literature. We use both the acylamino and acylimino representations for convenience throughout this patent with the understanding that the structures are in reality a hybrid of the three forms with the actual amount of each dependent on the pH, the cite of action and the nature of the substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds represented by formula (I), X may be hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, lower alkyl-thio, phenyl-lower alkyl-thio, lower alkyl-sulfonyl, or phenyl-lower alkyl-sulfonyl.

Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared and used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain or enhance the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts are (a) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; (b) salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, malonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, glycolic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate, pamoate, salicylic acid, stearic acid, phthalic acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid and the like; and (c) salts formed from elemental anions for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be noted that all enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers and racemic mixtures of compounds within the scope of formula (I) are embraced by the present invention. All mixtures of such enantiomers and diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of formula (I) function in vivo as sodium channel blockers and as beta receptor agonists. By blocking epithelial sodium channels as well as activating beta-receptors present in mucosal surfaces the compounds of formula (I) reduce the absorption of water by the mucosal surfaces. This effect increases the volume of protective liquids on mucosal surfaces, rebalances the system, and thus treats disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides methods of treatment that take advantage of the properties of the compounds of formula (I) discussed above. Thus, subjects that may be treated by the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, patients afflicted with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, artificially ventilated patients, patients with acute pneumonia, etc. The present invention may be used to obtain a sputum sample from a patient by administering the active compounds to at least one lung of a patient, and then inducing or collecting a sputum sample from that patient. Typically, the invention will be administered to respiratory mucosal surfaces via aerosol (liquid or dry powders) or lavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubjects that may be treated by the method of the present invention also include patients being administered supplemental oxygen nasally (a regimen that tends to dry the airway surfaces); patients afflicted with an allergic disease or response (e.g., an allergic response to pollen, dust, animal hair or particles, insects or insect particles, etc.) that affects nasal airway surfaces; patients afflicted with a bacterial infection e.g., \nstaphylococcus \ninfections such as \nStaphylococcus aureus \ninfections, \nHemophilus influenza \ninfections, \nStreptococcus pneumoniae \ninfections, \nPseudomonas aeuriginosa \ninfections, etc.) of the nasal airway surfaces; patients afflicted with an inflammatory disease that affects nasal airway surfaces; or patients afflicted with sinusitis (wherein the active agent or agents are administered to promote drainage of congested mucous secretions in the sinuses by administering an amount effective to promote drainage of congested fluid in the sinuses), or combined, Rhinosinusitis. The invention may be administered to rhino-sinal surfaces by topical delivery, including aerosols and drops.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention may be used to hydrate mucosal surfaces other than airway surfaces. Such other mucosal surfaces include gastrointestinal surfaces, oral surfaces, genito-urethral (vaginal) surfaces, ocular surfaces or surfaces of the eye, the inner ear and the middle ear. For example, the active compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable means, including locally/topically, orally, or rectally, in an effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is concerned primarily with the treatment of human subjects, but may also be employed for the treatment of other mammalian subjects, such as dogs and cats, for veterinary purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, the compounds used to prepare the compositions of the present invention may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable free base. Because the free base of the compound is generally less soluble in aqueous solutions than the salt, free base compositions are employed to provide more sustained release of active agent to the lungs. An active agent present in the lungs in particulate form which has not dissolved into solution yet serves as a depot of drug which gradually becomes bioavailable as it slowly dissolves into solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a compound of formula (I) in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an aqueous carrier solution). In general, the compound of formula (I) is included in the composition in an amount effective to inhibit the reabsorption of water by mucosal surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with a P2Y2 receptor agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (also sometimes referred to as an “active agent” herein). The composition may further comprise a P2Y2 receptor agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (also sometimes referred to as an “active agent” herein). The P2Y2 receptor agonist is typically included in an amount effective to stimulate chloride and water secretion by airway surfaces, particularly nasal airway surfaces. Suitable P2Y2 receptor agonists are described in columns 9-10 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,975, U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,256, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,498, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBronchodilators can also be used in combination with compounds of the present invention. These bronchodilators include, hut are not limited to, anticholinergic agents including but not limited to ipratropium bromide, as well as compounds such as theophylline and aminophylline. These compounds may be administered in accordance with known techniques, either prior to or concurrently with the active compounds described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIonic and organic osmolytes can also be used in combination with compounds of the present invention. Ionic osmolytes useful include any salt consisting of a pharmaceutically acceptable anion and a pharmaceutical cation. Organic osmolytes include, but are not limited to, sugars, sugar alcohols and organic osmolytes. Detailed examples of ionic and non-ionic osmolytes are given in U.S. Pat. No. 6,926,911 incorporated herein by reference. A particularly useful ionic osmolyte is hypertonic sodium chloride or sodium nitrite. A particularly useful organic osmolyte is the reduced sugar mannitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation, comprising an active compound as described above in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an aqueous carrier solution). In general, the active compound is included in the composition in an amount effective to treat mucosal surfaces, such as inhibiting the reabsorption of water by mucosal surfaces, including airway and other surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds disclosed herein may be administered to mucosal surfaces by any suitable means, including topically, orally, rectally, vaginally, ocularly and dermally, etc. For example, for the treatment of constipation, the active compounds may be administered orally or rectally to the gastrointestinal mucosal surface. The active compound may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in any suitable form, such as sterile physiological or dilute saline or topical solution, as a droplet, tablet or the like for oral administration, as a suppository for rectal or genito-urethral administration, etc. Excipients may be included in the formulation to enhance the solubility of the active compounds, as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds disclosed herein may be administered to the airway surfaces of a patient by any suitable means, including as a spray, mist, or droplets of the active compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as physiological or dilute saline solutions or distilled water. For example, the active compounds may be prepared as formulations and administered as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,391 to Jacobus, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid or liquid particulate active agents prepared for practicing the present invention could, as noted above, include particles of respirable or non-respirable size; that is, for respirable particles, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs, and for non-respirable particles, particles sufficiently large to be retained in the nasal airway passages rather than pass through the larynx and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. In general, particles ranging from about 1 to 5 microns in size (more particularly, less than about 4.7 microns in size) are respirable. Particles of non-respirable size are greater than about 5 microns in size, up to the size of visible droplets. Thus, for nasal administration, a particle size in the range of 10-500 may be used to ensure retention in the nasal cavity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the manufacture of a formulation according to the invention, active agents or the physiologically acceptable salts or free bases thereof are typically admixed with, inter cilia, an acceptable carrier. Of course, the carrier must be compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier must be solid or liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a capsule, that may contain 0.5% to 99% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which formulations may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions containing respirable or non-respirable dry particles of micronized active agent may be prepared by grinding the dry active agent with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the micronized composition through a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particulate active agent composition may optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formulation of an aerosol. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which may be blended with the active agent in any suitable ratio (e.g., a 1 to 1 ratio by weight).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive compounds disclosed herein may be administered to airway surfaces including the nasal passages, sinuses and lungs of a subject by a suitable means know in the art, such as by nose drops, mists, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, the active compounds of the present invention and administered by transbronchoscopic lavage. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the active compounds of the present invention are deposited on lung airway surfaces by administering an aerosol suspension of respirable particles comprised of the active compound, which the subject inhales. The respirable particles may be liquid or solid. Numerous inhalers for administering aerosol particles to the lungs of a subject are known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhalers such as those developed by Nolctar Therapeutic Systems, Palo Alto, Calif., USA, may be employed, including but not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,740,794; 5,654,007; 5,458,135; 5,775,320; and 5,785,049, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The Applicant specifically intends that the disclosures of all patent references cited herein be incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Inhalers such as those developed by Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, Calif., USA, may also be employed, including but not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,622,166; 5,577,497; 5,645,051; and 5,492,112, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, inhalers such as those developed by Aradigm Corp., Hayward, Calif., USA, may be employed, including but not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,826,570; 5,813,397; 5,819,726; and 5,655,516, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. These apparatuses are particularly suitable as dry particle inhalers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosols of liquid particles comprising the active compound may be produced by any suitable means, such as with a pressure-driven aerosol nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729, which is incorporated herein by reference. Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions of the active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable formulations for use in nebulizers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier, the active ingredient comprising up to 40% w/w of the formulation, but preferably less than 20% w/w. The carrier is typically water (and most preferably sterile, pyrogen-free water) or dilute aqueous alcoholic solution. Perfluorocarbon carriers may also be used. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not made sterile, for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate, antioxidants, flavoring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents and surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosols of solid particles comprising the active compound may likewise be produced with any solid particulate medicament aerosol generator. Aerosol generators for administering solid particulate medicaments to a subject produce particles which are respirable, as explained above, and generate a volume of aerosol containing predetermined metered dose of medicament at a rate suitable for human administration. One illustrative type of solid particulate aerosol generator is an insufflator. Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely comminuted powders which may be delivered by means of an insufflator or taken into the nasal cavity in the manner of a snuff. In the insufflator, the powder (e.g., a metered dose thereof effective to carry out the treatments described herein) is contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of powder blend comprising the active ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically comprises of 0.1 to 100% w/w of the formulation. A second type of illustrative aerosol generator comprises a metered dose inhaler. Metered dose inhalers are pressurized aerosol dispensers, typically containing a suspension or solution formulation of active ingredient in a liquified propellant. During use, these devices discharge the formulation through a valve adapted to deliver a metered volume, typically from 10 to 150 μl, to produce a fine particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain chlorofluorocarbon compounds, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof. The formulation may additionally contain one of more co-solvents, for example, ethanol, surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, antioxidants and suitable flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aerosol, whether formed from solid or liquid particles, may be produced by the aerosol generator at a rate of from about 10 to 150 liters per minute, more preferable from 30 to 150 liters per minute, and most preferably about 60 liters per minute. Aerosols containing greater amounts of medicament may be administered more rapidly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of the active compounds disclosed herein will vary depending on the condition being treated and the state of the subject, but generally may be from about 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 to 1, 5, 10 or 20 mg of the pharmaceutic agent, deposited on the airway surfaces. The daily dose may be divided among one or multiple unit dose administrations. The goal is to achieve a concentration of the pharmaceutic agents on lung airway surfaces of between 10\n−9\n-10\n4 \nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, they are administered by administering an aerosol suspension of respirable or non-respirable particles (preferably non-respirable particles) comprised of active compound, which the subject inhales through the nose. The respirable or non respirable particles may be liquid or solid. The quantity of active agent included may b an amount of sufficient to achieve dissolved concentrations of active agent on the airway surfaces of the subject of from about 10\n−9\n, 10\n−8\n, or 10\n−7 \nto about 10\n−3\n, 10\n−2\n, 10\n−1 \nmoles/liter, and more preferably from about 10\n−9 \nto about 10\n−4 \nmoles/liter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of active compound will vary depending on the condition being treated and the state of the subject, but generally may be an amount sufficient to achieve dissolved concentrations of active compound on the nasal airway surfaces of the subject from about 10\n−9\n, 10\n−8\n, 10\n−7 \nto about 10\n−3\n, 10\n−2\n, or 10\n−1 \nmoles/liter, and more preferably from about 10\n−7 \nto about 10\n−4 \nmoles/liter. Depending upon the solubility of the particular formulation of active compound administered, the daily dose may be divided among one or several unit dose administrations. The daily dose by weight may range from about 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 to 10 or 20 milligrams of active agent particles for a human subject, depending upon the age and condition of the subject. A currently preferred unit dose is about 0.5 milligrams of active agent given at a regimen of 2-10 administrations per day. The dosage may be provided as a prepackaged unit by any suitable means (e.g., encapsulating a gelatin capsule).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the particulate active agent composition may contain both a free base of active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt to provide both early release and sustained release of active agent for dissolution into the mucus secretions of the nose. Such a composition serves to provide both early relief to the patient, and sustained relief over time. Sustained relief, by decreasing the number of daily administrations required, is expected to increase patient compliance with the course of active agent treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations suitable for airway administration include formulations of solutions, emulsions, suspensions and extracts. See generally, J. Nairn, Solutions, Emulsions, Suspensions and Extracts, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, chap. 86 (19\nth \ned. 1995), incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for nasal administration may be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,389,393 to Schor, 5,707,644 to Ilium; 4,294,829 to Suzuki; and 4,835,142 to Suzuki, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMists or aerosols of liquid particles comprising the active compound may be produced by any suitable means, such as by a simple nasal spray with the active agent in an aqueous pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as a sterile saline solution or sterile water. Administration may be with a pressure-driven aerosol nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,501,729 and 5,656,256, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Suitable formulations for use in a nasal droplet or spray bottle or in nebulizers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier, the active ingredient comprising up to 40% v/v of the formulation, but preferably less than 20% w/w. Typically the carrier is water (and most preferably sterile, pyrogen-free water) or dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made in a 0.12% to 0.8% solution of sodium chloride. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not made sterile, for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate antioxidants, flavoring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents, osmotically active agents (e.g. mannitol, xylitol, erythritol) and surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions containing respirable or non-respirable dry particles of micronized active agent may be prepared by grinding the dry active agent with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the micronized composition through a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particulate composition may optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which may be blended with the active agent in any suitable ratio (e.g., a 1 to 1 ratio by weight).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be synthesized according to procedures known in the art.

Representative assays are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. In Vitro Measure of Epithelial Sodium Channel Block and Beta Agonist Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the potency of epithelial sodium channel block and beta agonist activity each compound was tested using two separate experimental procedures with similar methodology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess epithelial sodium channel blocker potency the compounds of the present invention involves the determination of lumenal drug inhibition of airway epithelial sodium currents measured under short circuit current (I\nSC\n) using airway epithelial monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. Cells obtained from freshly excised human, or dog airways are seeded onto porous 0.4 micrometer Transwell® Permeable Supports (Corning Inc. Acton, Mass.), cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions in hormonally defined media, and assayed for sodium transport activity (I\nSC\n) while bathed in Krebs Bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) in Ussing chambers. All test drug additions are to the lumenal bath with approximately half-log dose additions (from 1×10\n−11 \nM to 6×10\n−5 \nM), and the cumulative change in I\nSC \n(decreases) recorded. All drugs are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions at a concentration of approximately 1×10\n−2 \nand stored at −20° C. Six preparations are typically run in parallel; one preparation per run incorporates 552-02 as a positive control. Before the start of the concentration-effect relationship propranolol, a non-selective beta agonist blocker, was applied to the lumenal bath (10 μM) to inhibit the beta agonist component of the designer multiple ligand (DML). All data from the voltage clamps are collected via a computer face and analyzed off-line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConcentration-effect relationships for all compounds are considered and analyzed Using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego Calif. USA. IC\n50 \nvalues, maximal effective concentrations, are calculated and compared to the 552-02 potency as a positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess beta agonist activity the compounds of the present invention involves the determination of lumenal drug addition to promote airway epithelial anion currents measured under short circuit current (I\nSC\n) using airway epithelial monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. Cells obtained from freshly excised human, dog, or sheep airways are seeded onto porous 0.4 micron Transwell® Permeable Supports (Corning), cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions in hormonally defined media, and assayed for anion secretion (I\nSC\n) while bathed in Krebs Bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) in Ussing chambers. All test drug additions are to the lumenal bath with approximately half-log dose additions (from 8×10\n−10 \nM to 6.5×10\n−5 \nM), and the cumulative change in I\nSC \n(excitation) recorded. All drugs are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions at a concentration from 1×10\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−2 \nM and stored at −20° C. Six preparations are typically run in parallel; one preparation per run incorporates either formoterol, salmeterol, or another well recognized beta agonists as a positive control depending on the analog incorporated in the compound being tested. Before the start of the concentration-effect relationship 552-02 a potent sodium channel blocker was applied to the apical surface (1 μM) to eliminate changes in Isc caused by sodium absorption. All data from the voltage clamps are collected via a computer interface and analyzed off-line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConcentration-effect relationships for all compounds are considered and analyzed Using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego Calif.

In Vitro Assay of Compound Absorption and Biotransformation by Airway Epithelia\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAirway epithelial cells have the capacity to metabolize drugs during the process of transepithelial absorption. Further, although less likely, it is possible that drugs can be metabolized on airway epithelial surfaces by specific ectoenzyme activities. Perhaps more likely as an ecto-surface event, compounds may be metabolized by the infected secretions that occupy the airway lumens of patients with lung disease, e.g. cystic fibrosis. Thus, a series of assays are performed to characterize any compound biotransformation (metabolism or conjugation) that results from the interaction of test compounds with human airway epithelia and/or human airway epithelial lumenal products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first series of assays, the interaction of test compounds in KBR as an “ASL” stimulant are applied to the apical surface of human airway epithelial cells grown in the Transwell® Permeable Supports (Corning), insert system. For most compounds, metabolism or conjugation (generation of new species) is tested for using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to resolve chemical species and the endogenous fluorescence properties of these compounds to estimate the relative quantities of test compound and novel metabolites. For a typical assay, a test solution (1 mL KBR, containing 100 μM test compound) is placed on the epithelial lumenal surface. Sequential 5 to 600 μl samples are obtained from the lumenal and serosal compartments respectively for HPLC analysis of (1) the mass of test compound permeating from the lumenal to serosal bath and (2) the potential formation of metabolites from the parent compound. From the HPLC data, the rate of and/or formation of novel metabolite compounds on the lumenal surface and the appearance of test compound and/or novel metabolite in the basolateral solution is quantitated based on internal standards. The data relating the chromatographic mobility of potential novel metabolites with reference to the parent compound are also quantitated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo analyze the potential metabolism of test compounds by CF sputum, a “representative” mixture of expectorated CF sputum obtained from 10 CF patients (under IRB approval) has been collected. The sputum has been be solubilized in a 1:5 mixture of KBR solution with vigorous vortexing, following which the mixture was split into a “neat” sputum aliquot and an aliquot subjected to ultracentrifugation so that a “supernatant” aliquot was obtained (neat=cellular; supernatant=liquid phase). Typical studies of compound metabolism by CF sputum involve the addition of known masses of test compound to “neat” CF sputum and aliquots of CF sputum “supernatant” incubated at 37° C., followed by sequential sampling of aliquots from each sputum type for characterization of compound stability/metabolism by HPLC analysis as described above. As above, analysis of compound disappearance, rates of formation of novel metabolites, and HPLC mobilities of novel metabolites are then performed.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Sodium Channel Blockers with Beta Agonist Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nMaterials and Methods.

The heads of the animals were immobilized, and local anesthesia of the nasal passage was provided (2% lidocaine) prior to nasal intubation (7.5 mm-I.D. endotracheal tube (ETT) (Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, Mo.). The cuff of the ETT was placed just below the vocal cords. After intubation, the animals were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 20 min before MCC measurements began.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSheep MCC in vivo Measurement: Aerosols of sulfur colloid radiolabeled with technetium (\n99m\nTc-SC 3.1 mg/mL, ˜10-15 mCi) were generated by a Raindrop Nebulizer (Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Pleasanton, Calif.) which produces a median aerodynamic droplet diameter of 3.6 μm. The nebulizer was connected to a dosimeter system consisting of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed into a T piece, with one end attached to a respirator (Harvard apparatus, South Natick, Mass.). The system was activated for 1 second at the onset of the respirator's inspiratory cycle. The tidal volume was set at 300 mL, with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:1, and a rate of 20 breaths/min, to maximize central airway deposition. The sheep breathed the \n99m\nTc-SC aerosol for up to 5 min. Following tracer deposition, a gamma camera was used to measure the clearance of \n99m\nTc-SC from the airways. The camera was positioned above the animal's back with the sheep in its natural upright position in the harness. The field of the image was perpendicular to the animal's spinal cord. External radiolabeled markers were placed on the sheep to facilitate proper alignment of the gamma camera. A region of interest was traced over the image corresponding to the right lung of the sheep and counts were recorded. The counts were corrected for decay and expressed as a percentage of radioactivity present in the baseline image. The left lung was excluded from the analysis because the outline of the lung was superimposed over the stomach and counts could be affected by swallowed \n99m\nTc-SC-labeled mucus. Alt deposition images were stored on a computer interfaced to the gamma camera. The protocol included a baseline deposition image obtained immediately post radio-aerosol administration. After acquisition of baseline images, either 4 mL of H\n2\nO (vehicle), formoterol (3 mM), or novel chemical entity (3 mM) were aerosolized using the Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing sheep using two separate protocols. Protocol 1, acquired data immediately after dosing (time 0 to 1 hour), and indicated the immediate physiological response ‘short-term efficacy’ protocol 2, acquired data 4 hours post dosing indicated compound durability and ‘long-term efficacy’. The nebulizer had a flow rate of 8 L/min and the time to deliver the solution was 10-12 min. On the completion of compound administration, the animal was immediately extubated to prevent false elevations in counts due to aspiration of excess \n99m\nTc-SC-labeled mucus from the ETT. Serial measurements of \n99m\nTc-SC retained in the lung were obtained over a 1 hour period at 5 min intervals. A washout period of at least 7 days (half life of \n99m\nTC=6 h) separated studies with the different agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical Analysis: Data from the in vivo sheep MCC assays were analyzed using a two way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by slope analysis of the linear regression of the retention vs time plot using an ANOCOVA to compare slopes, and if needed a multiple comparison test (Newman-Keuls). The percent activity retained (post 4 hours was calculated by dividing the slope value from protocol 2 by the slope value obtained in protocol 1 and multiplying by 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal Preparation: Adult ewes (ranging in weight from 25 to 35 kg) were restrained in an upright position in a specialized body harness adapted to a modified shopping cart. The animals' heads were immobilized and local anesthesia of the nasal passage was induced with 2% lidocaine. The animals were then nasally intubated with a 7.5 mm internal diameter endotracheal tube (ETT). The cuff of the ETT was placed just below the vocal cords and its position was verified with a flexible bronchoscope. After intubation the animals were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 20 minutes prior to initiating measurements of mucociliary clearance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of Radio-aerosol: Aerosols of \n99m\nTc-Human serum albumin (3.1 mg/ml; containing approximately 20 mCi) were generated using a Raindrop Nebulizer which produces a droplet with a median aerodynamic diameter of 3.6 μm. The nebulizer was connected to a dosimetry system consisting of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed into a plastic T connector; one end of which was connected to the endotracheal tube, the other was connected to a piston respirator. The system was activated for one second at the onset of the respirator's inspiratory cycle. The respirator was set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, an inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:1, and at a rate of 20 breaths per minute to maximize the central airway deposition. The sheep breathed the radio-labeled aerosol for 5 minutes. A gamma camera was used to measure the clearance of \n99m\nTc-Human serum albumin from the airways. The camera was positioned above the animal=s back with the sheep in a natural upright position supported in a cart so that the field of image was perpendicular to the animal=s spinal cord. External radio-labeled markers were placed on the sheep to ensure proper alignment under the gamma camera. All images were stored in a computer integrated with the gamma camera. A region of interest was traced over the image corresponding to the right lung of the sheep and the counts were recorded. The counts were corrected for decay and expressed as percentage of radioactivity present in the initial baseline image. The left lung was excluded from the analysis because its outlines are superimposed over the stomach and counts can be swallowed and enter the stomach as radio-labeled mucus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment Protocol (Assessment of activity at t-zero): A baseline deposition image was obtained immediately after radio-aerosol administration. At time zero, after acquisition of the baseline image, vehicle control (distilled water), positive control (amiloride), or experimental compounds were aerosolized from a 4 ml volume using a Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing animals. The nebulizer was driven by compressed air with a flow of 8 liters per minute. The time to deliver the solution was 10 to 12 minutes. Animals were extubated immediately following delivery of the total dose in order to prevent false elevations in counts caused by aspiration of excess radio-tracer from the ETT. Serial images of the lung were obtained at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after dosing and hourly for the next 6 hours after dosing for a total observation period of 8 hours. A washout period of at least 7 days separated dosing sessions with different experimental agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment Protocol (Assessment of Activity at t-4 hours): The following variation of the standard protocol was used to assess the durability of response following a single exposure to vehicle control (distilled water), positive control compounds (amiloride or benzamil), or investigational agents. At time zero, vehicle control (distilled water), positive control (amiloride), or investigational compounds were aerosolized from a 4 ml volume using a Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing animals. The nebulizer was driven by compressed air with a flow of 8 liters per minute. The time to deliver the solution was 10 to 12 minutes. Animals were restrained in an upright position in a specialized body harness for 4 hours. At the end of the 4-hour period animals received a single dose of aerosolized \n99m\nTc-Human serum albumin (3.1 mg/ml; containing approximately 20 mCi) from a Raindrop Nebulizer. Animals were extubated immediately following delivery of the total dose of radio-tracer. A baseline deposition image was obtained immediately after radio-aerosol administration. Serial images of the lung were obtained at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after administration of the radio-tracer (representing hours 4 through 6 after drug administration) and hourly for the next 2 hours after dosing for a total observation period of 4 hours. A washout period of at least 7 days separated dosing sessions with different experimental agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistics: Data were analyzed using SYSTAT for Windows, version 5. Data were analyzed using a two-way repeated ANOVA to assess overall effects), followed by a paired t-test to identify differences between specific pairs. Significance was accepted when P was less than or equal to 0.05. Slope values (calculated from data collected during the initial 45 minutes after dosing in the t-zero assessment) for mean MCC curves were calculated using linear least square regression to assess differences in the initial rates during the rapid clearance phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein."
