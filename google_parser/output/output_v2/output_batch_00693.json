Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the discovery of particular heterocyclic compounds, and further to particular salts of these heterocycles, possessing increased activity as mGluR5 antagonists. In addition, the present invention relates to therapeutic methods of use of these compounds for the treatment and prevention of various diseases and conditions.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nUnsaturated heterocylic compounds find a wide variety of uses. For example, compounds of this class find uses as modulators of physiological processes that are mediated by ligand-activated receptors. Receptors that are activated by ligands are located throughout the nervous, cardiac, renal, digestive and bronchial systems, among others. In the nervous system, for example, heterocyclic compounds are capable of functioning as agonists or antagonists of receptors for neurotransmitters, neurohormones and neuromodulators. Ligand-activated receptors have been identified in a wide variety of species, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates as well as in invertebrate species. Therefore, compounds of this class are also able to modulate receptor-mediated processes throughout phylogeny and find uses in a wide variety of applications, e.g., as pharmaceuticals, insecticides, fungicides and other uses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptors activated by excitatory amino acids, such as the amino acid L-glutamic acid (glutamate), are a major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor class in the mammalian central nervous system. Anatomical, biochemical and electrophysiological analyses suggest that glutamatergic systems are involved in a broad array of neuronal processes, including fast excitatory synaptic transmission, regulation of neurotransmitter release, long-term potentiation, long-term depression, learning and memory, developmental synaptic plasticity, hypoxic-ischemic damage and neuronal cell death, epileptiform seizures, visual processing, as well as the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. See generally, \nNakanishi et al., Brain Research Reviews 26:230-235 (1998\n);\n Monaghan et al., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 29:365-402 (1980\n). This extensive repertoire of functions, especially those related to learning, neurotoxicity, and neuropathology, has stimulated recent attempts to describe and define the mechanisms through which glutamate exerts its effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlutamate has been observed to mediate its effects through receptors that have been categorized into two main groups: ionotropic and metabotropic. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are generally divided into two classes: the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. Both classes of receptors are linked to integral cation channels and share some amino acid sequence homology. GluR1-4 are termed AMPA (a- amino-3-hydroxy-5 methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptors because AMPA preferentially activates receptors composed of these subunits, while GluRS-7 and KA1-2 are termed kainate receptors as these are preferentially sensitive to kainic acid. Thus, an \"AMPA receptor\" is a non-NMDA receptor that can be activated by AMPA. AMPA receptors include the GluR1-4 family, which form homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric complexes which display different current-voltage relations and calcium permeability. Polypeptides encoded by GluR1-4 nucleic acid sequences can form functional ligand gated ion channels. An AMPA receptor includes a receptor having a GluR1, GluR2, GIuR3 and/or GluR4 subunit. A NMDA receptor includes a receptor having NMDARI, NMDAR2a, NMDAR2b, NMDAR2c, NMDAR2d and/or NMDAR3 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three groups based on amino acid sequence homology, transduction mechanism and pharmacological properties, namely Group I, Group II and Group III. Each Group of receptors contains one or more types of receptors. For example, Group I includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mGluR1 and mGluR5), Group II includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group III includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 4, 6, 7 and 8 (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8). Several subtypes of a particular mGluR type may exist. For example, subtypes of mGluR1 include mGluRla, mGluRlb, mGluRlc and mGluRld.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnatomical studies demonstrate a broad and selective distribution of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the mammalian nervous system. For example, mGluRl is expressed in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, ventral pallidum and substantia nigra (\nPetralia et al., (1997) J. Chem. Neuroanat., 13:77-93\n;\n Shigemoto et al., (1992) J. Comp. Neurol., 322:121-135\n). In contrast, mGluR5 is weakly expressed in the cerebellum, while higher levels of expression are found in the striatum and cortex (\nRomano et al., (1995) J. Comp. Neurol., 355:455-469\n). In the hippocampus, mGluR5 appears widely distributed and is diffusely expressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are typically characterized by seven putative transmembrane domains, preceded by a large putative extracellular amino-terminal domain and followed by a large putative intracelluar carboxy-terminal domain. The receptors couple to G- proteins and activate certain second messengers depending on the receptor group. Thus, for example, Group I mGluR's activate phospholipase C. Activation of the receptors results in the hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and inositol trisphosphate, which in turn activates the inositol trisphosphate receptor to promote the release of 20 intracellular calcium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of heterocyclic compounds having activity as mGluR5 antagonists have been described in our International Publication No. \n \nWO 01/16121\n \n and related national phase applications such as \n \n09/387,073\n \n (abandoned) and \n \n10/217,800\n \n, issued as United States Patent No. \n \n6, 774,138\n \n, for modulating the activity of the mGluR5 receptor and for use in the treatment of mGluR5 mediated conditions. Because of the physiological and pathological significance of excitatory amino acid receptors generally, and metabotropic glutamate receptors in particular, there is a need to identify ever more effective methods of modulating excitatory amino acid receptor-mediated processes, as well as more effective therapeutic methods of treatment and methods for prevention of diseases. There is thus a continuing need in the art to identify new and increasingly potent members of a compound class that can modulate excitatory amino acid receptors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe identification of a series of compounds which falls within the scope of the group of compounds described and claimed in \n \nWO 01/16121\n \n and in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,744,138\n \n but which is not specifically disclosed therein, which series of compounds possesses special advantages in terms of drug-like properties. That is, the compounds described herein show increased potential for use as drugs due to their possessing uniquely advantageous properties in terms of potency and/or selectivity and/or pharmacokinetic properties and/or \nin vivo\n receptor occupancy properties.

The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated, the severity of the disorder, the activity of the specific compound used, the route of administration, the rate of clearance of the specific compound, the duration of treatment, the drugs used in combination or coincident with the specific compound,- the age, body weight, sex, diet and general health of the patient, and like factors well known in the medical arts and sciences. Dosage levels typically fall in the range of about 0.001 up to 100 mg/kg/day; with levels in the range of about 0. 05 up to 10 mg/kg/day being preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another embodiment of the invention, there are provided methods for preventing disease conditions in a subject at risk thereof, said method comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the heterocyclic compounds described above in accordance with invention methods for modulating the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase \"preventing disease conditions\" refers to preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a subject who may be at risk for the disease, but has not yet been diagnosed as having the disease. Those of skill in the art will understand that a variety of methods may be used to determine a subject at risk for a disease, and that whether a subject is at risk for a disease will depend on a variety of factors known to those of skill in the art, including genetic make-up of the subject, age, body weight, sex, diet, general health, occupation, exposure to environmental conditions, marital status, and the like, of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of skill in the art can readily identify a variety of assays that can be used to assess the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors. For receptor species that activate a second messenger pathway, assays that measure receptor-activated changes in intracellular second messengers can be employed to monitor receptor activity. For example, inhibition of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors using a radioligand binding assay. (See Example 109.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, activation of excitatory amino acid receptors that leads to the release of intracellular calcium or changes in intracellular calcium concentration can also be used to assess excitatory amino acid receptor activity. Methods of detection of transient increases in intracellular calcium concentration are well known in the art. (See e.g.,\n Ito et al., J. Neurochem. 56:531-540 (1991\n) and Example 108). G-protein coupled receptors are also coupled to other second messenger systems such as phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (see, e.g., \nBerridge et al, (1982) Biochem. J. 206: 587-5950\n; and \nNakajima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:2437-2442 (1992\n) and Example 110).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the invention in any manner, shape, or form, either explicitly or implicitly. While they are typical of those that might be used, other procedures, methodologies, or techniques known to those skill in the art may alternatively be used.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIntermediate 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-chloro-5-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2-Chloro-5-iodopyridine (40 mmol, 10.0 g), 2-methyl-4-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-1,3-thiazole (40 mmol, 7.8 g), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (2 mmol, 1.4 g), copper(I) iodide (4 mmol, 760 mg) and triethylamine (200 mmol, 28 mL) were added to deoxygenated DMF (200 mL) at room temperature.

Cells were activated by the addition of 10 pM glutamate, and the plates left for 1 hour at 37°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 mL ice-cold methanol to each well. In order to isolate inositol phosphates (IPs), the cells were scraped from wells, and placed in numbered glass test tubes. Chloroform (1 mL) was added to each tube, the tubes were mixed, and the phases separated by centrifugation. IPs were separated on Dowex anion exchange columns (AG 1-X8 100-200 mesh formate form). The upper aqueous layer (750 L) was added to the Dowex columns, and the \n \nPCT/US00/23923 109\n \n columns eluted with distilled water (3 mL). The eluents were discarded, and the columns were washed with 60 mM ammonium formate/5 mM Borax (10 mL), which was also discarded as waste. Finally the columns were eluted with 800 mM ammonium formate/0.1 M formic acid (4 mL), and the samples collected in scintillation vials. Scintillant was added to each vial, and the vials shaken, and counted in a scintillation counter after 2 hours. Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with certain exemplary compounds was compared to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with control. Using this procedure an IC\n50\n value of 33 nM was obtained for for Example 1 and an IC\n50\n value of 2 nM for Example 18.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity of Representative Compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe activity of certain of the compounds disclosed in the previous examples is presented below (N.D. = not determined):\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample\n \n \n \nCalcium Flux Assay (nM)\n \n \n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n3\n \n20\n \n \n \n2\n \n1.0\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n3\n \n0.9\n \n2.7\n \n \n \n4\n \n2.2\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n5\n \n6.3\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n6\n \n4.4\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n7\n \n1.1\n \n0.7\n \n \n \n8\n \n1.0\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n9\n \n1.1\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n10\n \n0.7\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n11\n \n1.3\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n12\n \n0.6\n \n1.1\n \n \n \n13\n \n0.6\n \n0.6\n \n \n \n14\n \n0.8\n \n7.5\n \n \n \n15\n \n1.0\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n16\n \n0.4\n \n8.6\n \n \n \n17\n \n0.4\n \n3.8\n \n \n \n18\n \n4.9\n \n19.3\n \n \n \n19\n \n1.8\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n20\n \n1.0\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n21\n \n1.5\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n22\n \n1.2\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n23\n \n1.6\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n24\n \n0.3\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n25\n \n1.4\n \n9.0\n \n \n \n26\n \n0.1\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n27\n \n1.4\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n28\n \n1.7\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n29\n \n0.5\n \n10\n \n \n \n30\n \n2.2\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n31\n \n2.9\n \n12.2\n \n \n \n32\n \n1.0\n \n4.8\n \n \n \n33\n \n19\n \n7\n \n \n \n34\n \n18\n \n15\n \n \n \n35\n \n17\n \n5\n \n \n \n36\n \n14\n \n3\n \n \n \n37\n \n14\n \n10\n \n \n \n38\n \n13\n \n8\n \n \n \n39\n \n13\n \n4\n \n \n \n40\n \n12\n \n9\n \n \n \n41\n \n11\n \n5\n \n \n \n42\n \n11\n \n17\n \n \n \n43\n \n11\n \n0.65\n \n \n \n44\n \n11\n \n2\n \n \n \n45\n \n11\n \n7\n \n \n \n46\n \n11\n \n2\n \n \n \n47\n \n11\n \n19\n \n \n \n48\n \n9\n \n12.5\n \n \n \n49\n \n9\n \n5.5\n \n \n \n50\n \n9\n \n12\n \n \n \n51\n \n8\n \n9\n \n \n \n52\n \n8\n \n2\n \n \n \n53\n \n8\n \n8\n \n \n \n54\n \n8\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n55\n \n7\n \n4\n \n \n \n56\n \n7\n \n13\n \n \n \n57\n \n7\n \n7.5\n \n \n \n58\n \n7\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n59\n \n6\n \n4\n \n \n \n60\n \n6\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n61\n \n6\n \n12\n \n \n \n62\n \n6\n \n11\n \n \n \n63\n \n6\n \n4\n \n \n \n64\n \n6\n \n0.8\n \n \n \n65\n \n6\n \n8\n \n \n \n66\n \n5\n \n9\n \n \n \n67\n \n5\n \n7\n \n \n \n68\n \n5\n \n7\n \n \n \n69\n \n5\n \n14\n \n \n \n70\n \n5\n \n5\n \n \n \n71\n \n5\n \n4.5\n \n \n \n72\n \n5\n \n7\n \n \n \n73\n \n4\n \n2\n \n \n \n74\n \n4\n \n7.5\n \n \n \n75\n \n4\n \n4\n \n \n \n76\n \n3.5\n \n3\n \n \n \n77\n \n3\n \n13\n \n \n \n78\n \n3\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n79\n \n3\n \n16\n \n \n \n80\n \n3\n \n3\n \n \n \n81\n \n3\n \n6\n \n \n \n82\n \n3\n \n2\n \n \n \n83\n \n2\n \n12\n \n \n \n84\n \n2\n \n7\n \n \n \n85\n \n2\n \n1\n \n \n \n86\n \n2\n \n7\n \n \n \n87\n \n2\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n88\n \n2\n \n4\n \n \n \n89\n \n1.6\n \n2\n \n \n \n90\n \n1.5\n \n4\n \n \n \n91\n \n1\n \n1\n \n \n \n92\n \n12\n \n7\n \n \n \n93\n \n11\n \n3\n \n \n \n94\n \n9\n \n6\n \n \n \n95\n \n8\n \n9\n \n \n \n96\n \n5\n \n5\n \n \n \n97\n \n5\n \n13\n \n \n \n98\n \n4\n \n8\n \n \n \n99\n \n2.8\n \n33\n \n \n \n100\n \n2.3\n \n23\n \n \n \n101\n \n2\n \n24\n \n \n \n102\n \n2\n \n26\n \n \n \n103\n \n1.6\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n104\n \n1.5\n \n6\n \n \n \n105\n \n1\n \n1\n \n \n \n106\n \nN.D.\n \n6\n \n \n \n107\n \n16\n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \nNd=not determined\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote that the relatively high values in the calcium flux and binding assays, for Example 18, are counterbalanced by assay results in the IP assay (as reported in Example 110).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that modifications and variations are within the spirit and scope of that which is described and claimed."

Use as claimed in claim 24 wherein the inhibitor has no or negligible effect on at least one of carbonic anhydrase, serotonin receptors, acetylcholine receptors, dopamine receptors for treatment of aquaporin related diseases. Description\n\n\n\n\n Compounds, compositions and use\n\n\nThis invention relates to compounds having specific aquaporin (hereinafter AQP) modulating activity, in particular compounds having a modulating activity on aquaporin 4 (AQP-4). In particular, the invention relates to compounds having no or negligible clinical effect on at least one of carbonic anhydrase, serotonin receptors, acetylcholine receptors, dopamine receptors, and in particular protein targets located in the central nervous system (CNS) when administered in doses suitable for treatment of aquaporin related diseases. Aquaporins are intrinsic membrane channel proteins permeable to water and a few other small-molecular solutes. This class of proteins can be subdivided into the \"pure\" aquaporins (e.g. AQP4), which are only permeable to water, and the aquaglyceroporins (e.g. AQP3, AQP7 and AQP9), which, in addition to water, are also permeable to a few neutral solutes like glycerol, ammonia, short carbohydrates and urea. The aquaporins regulate the flow of water in and out cells. Ions and most other chemical components dissolved in the water do not pass through these channels. In particular, hydroxonium ions and other charged ions do not pass these water channels. The aquaporins comprise six transmembrane alpha-helices arranged in a right- handed bundle with the terminal amino group and carboxylic group located on the cellular inside of the membrane.\n\n\nThere are thirteen types of aquaporins expressed in humans (AQPO-AQP 12). These types of AQPs have different regulation and expression. The most described AQPs are aquaporin 1 (AQP 1), aquaporin 2 (AQP 2), aquaporin 3 (AQP 3) and aquaporin 4 (AQP 4). The location and function of these aquaporins is different. For example, AQP4 is mainly located in the skeletal muscle, kidneys and the central nervous system whereas AQP 5 is present in the lungs and exocrine glands.\n\n\nAQPl , located primarily in the kidneys and the capillaries (except capillaries of the CNS) might have a role related to various disease conditions like cyst formation in the kidneys, tumor growth, pulmonary edema and glaucoma. AQP2 might have a role related to kidney diseases. Aquaglyceroporins might be related to diabetes and obesity. \n\n AQP4 might be related to brain edema as a result of stroke, cancer, trauma, meningitis, and other brain related conditions such as epilepsy, Devic's disease (neuromyelitis optica), multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nAlthough the existence and important functions of aquaporins have been known for many years, no drugs with modulating activity on aquaporins are in clinical use or in regulatory development. However, several known compounds and drugs are claimed to have a modulating activity on aquaporins.\n\n\nMetal ions like mercury, silver and gold have been shown to inhibit most AQPs, with the exception of AQP4. This inhibition is reported to be through covalent modification of a cysteine residue, and is regarded as irreversible. Lead has been shown to increase the water permeability in a model expressing AQP4 and mercury chloride have been claimed to inhibit AQP4 in a liposome-based assay. The potential irreversible effects of these metal ions on the AQPs and the general toxicity of mercury and other metal ions exclude these salts as potential drug candidates for modulation of AQPs.\n\n\nTetraethylammonium salts and other quaternary ammonium salts are reported to inhibit AQPl, AQP2 and AQP4 with IC50 values in the micromolar range or higher. However, tetraethylammonium ions showed no effect in a recent study on AQPl (R. Søgaard et al. in Eur. J. Physiol,456,285-292(2008) nor on AQP4 (up to 10 mmolar concentration) (B.Yang et al. in FEBS Letters,580,6679-6684(2006).\n\n\nMoreover, quaternary ammonium salts have several disadvantages as potential drug candidates as they are permanently charged and will not be absorbed after oral administration. They also interact with other therapeutic targets.\n\n\nAcetazolamide, which is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has been reported to inhibit AQPl mediated water permeability and inhibit AQP4 mediated water permeability but other studies disagree. In a recent study it was shown that azetazolamide reversibly inhibits water permeation through AQP4 but not through AQPl . The IC50 value was found to be higher than 1 mmolar (Y.Tanimura et al. in J. Structural Biology, 166,16-21 (2009). Other sulphonamide carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are claimed to have IC50 values down to 20 micromolar with regard to inhibition of AQPl and AQP4.\n\n\nVarious active drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms of action (including GABA-A receptor agonists, estrogen receptor antagonists, D2 receptor \n\n agonists, adrenergic beta receptor antagonists, 5HT1B/1D receptor agonists, antibiotics, bronchial expectorants) have recently been evaluated as potential AQP4 inhibitors both in vitro and in in silico docking studies.\n\n\nIn another recent study, various antiepileptic drugs have been tested as inhibitors of AQP4.\n\n\nAQPs, especially AQP4, based on their pathophysiological^ important roles in humans, are clinically important targets for new drugs. The drugs described in the prior art with potential modulating effects on AQPs including AQP4 are compounds with other pharmacological properties in addition to an alleged inhibitory effect on AQPs. In addition, these drugs also have several adverse effects. There is therefore a medical need for more specific AQP modulators, especially modulators and inhibitors that modulate or inhibit AQP4.\n\n\nThe inventors have found that certain peptides are able to modulate the activity of aquaporins. Ideally they should not interact with certain other receptors which could limit their clinical use.\n\n\nSummary of the invention\n\n\nThus, viewed from one aspect the invention provides a peptide comprising a unit of formula (I)\n\n\n \n\n and having a molecular weight of less than 2000 preferably of formula (Y) \n\n\n and having a molecular weight of less than 2000, more preferably of formula (I\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand having a molecular weight of less than 2000; wherein each X is independently an organic group, e.g. a Ci\n-6\n alkyl or Ci\n-6\n alkenyl group, preferably -CH\n2\n-CH=CH\n2\n, or the two X groups taken together can form a covalent or non-covalent link between the two O groups, preferably a Ci-I\n0\n saturated or unsaturated carbon chain optionally interrupted by one or more heteroatoms selected from O, S, N, P, or Si, especially a C\n3-I0\n carbon chain or one X represents an azido group and the other an C2-6-alkynyl group; both Z's are the same and are O or S; each Y is independently C, CH, CH\n2\n, N or NH; Ri is H or Ci\n-6\n alkyl;\n\n\nR\n2\n is H or Ci\n-6\n alkyl; \n\n R\n5\n is a Ci-6 alkyl group, preferably isopropyl; or a salt, ester or prodrug thereof.\n\n\nPreferably compounds (I), (I\n1\n) and (IF) have groups R\n3\n and R\n4\n (defined in detail below) bound at the C and N termini (marked *) respectively.

Preferably modulation of the function of AQPs means inhibition of the function of AQPs. Preferably the AQP is AQP4.\n\n\nPreferably the inhibitor has no or negligible effect on at least one of carbonic anhydrase, serotonin receptors, acetylcholine receptors, dopamine receptors for treatment of aquaporin related diseases.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are ligands of AQPs, preferably modulators of AQPs, even more preferably inhibitors of AQP's. Ideally they have no other physiological effects. In particular, the compounds of the invention should have no effect or negligible effect on one or more of carbonic anhydrase, serotonin receptors, acetylcholine receptors or dopamine receptors.\n\n\nBy the term ligand of AQPs it is meant a compound having a binding affinity for an aquaporin, preferably aquaporin-4, having a dissociation constant of less than or equal to 10 micromolar. By the term modulator of AQP's it is meant a compound having a binding affinity for an aquaporin, preferably aquaporin-4, having a dissociation constant of less than or equal to 10 micromolar, more preferably less than or equal to 1 micromolar, even more preferably less than or equal to 500 nanomolar, even more preferably less than or equal to 250 nanomolar, most preferably less than or equal to 200 nanomolar.

Alternatively, the two X groups taken together can form a bridge between the two serine residues in the peptide. That bridge may comprise 1 to 10 atoms in the backbone, preferably 3 to 8 atoms, especially 4 to 6 atoms, preferably 4 atoms. The \n\n number of bridging atoms will be counted between the two O groups of the serine residue in the peptide backbone.\n\n\nIt is preferred if the backbone atoms making up the bridge are all C atoms. More preferably, the bridge is an aliphatic chain, especially a saturated or unsaturated bridge. In the most preferred embodiment the linker is -CH\n2\nCH=CH-CH\n2\n- or - CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment one X represents an azido group and the other an acetylenic group.\n\n\nY is preferably C, CH, CH\n2\n. It is especially preferred if the Y group reflects the structure of the amino acid used to form the peptide.\n\n\nRi is preferably hydrogen or methyl, especially hydrogen.\n\n\nR\n2\n is preferably Ci\n-6\n alkyl such as methyl, isopropyl, -CH\n2\nCH(Me\n2\n), or CH(Me)CH\n2\nCH\n3\n, especially isopropyl.\n\n\nIn a highly preferred embodiment Ri and R\n2\n are methyl or Ri is H when R\n2\n is isopropyl.\n\n\nR\n5\n is preferably methyl, isopropyl, -CH\n2\nCH(Me\n2\n), or CH(Me)CH\n2\nCH\n3\n, especially isopropyl.\n\n\nZ is preferably O.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated therefore that the preferred backbone unit of any compound of the invention is based on a Ser-Val-Val-Ser-Gly backbone. It is preferred if any amino acid unit present is in the L form.\n\n\nR\n3\n and R\n4\n are protective groups for carboxylic groups or amino groups respectively, or activating groups, fluorescent probes, radiolabeled groups or peptide chains with 1 - 20 amino acids in the chain. Preferably R\n3\n and R\n4\n are protective groups for carboxylic groups or amino groups respectively, or peptide chains with 1 - 20 amino acids in the chain.\n\n\nIt is especially preferred if R\n3\n is a protecting group for a carboxylic acid such as an ester, in particular a methyl ester or tert-butyl ester. Any standard C-terminus protecting group can however be used. C terminus protecting groups are well known in the art.\n\n\nR\n4\n is preferably an amino protecting group such as Boc or carboxbenzyl (Z). Any known N terminus protecting group can be used here however and those are well known to the skilled man. Other examples include, Fmoc and alloc. \n\n Alternatively, R\n4\n represents a further peptide chain, preferably containing 1 to 5 amino acid residues attached to the N terminus of the compound. In particular JR\n4\n represents one or two additional amino acids (preferably essential amino acids), especially one or two additional proline residues attached to the N-terminus. It will be obvious to the skilled man that the N-terminus amino acid can then carry a N terminus protecting group such as Boc or Z or an activating group.\n\n\nIn a highly preferred embodiment therefore the peptides of the invention comprise 5 to 7 amino acids, especially 5 or 7 amino acids.\n\n\nIn a further highly preferred embodiment, the invention includes a Pro-Pro-Ser- Val-Val-Ser-Gly backbone.\n\n\nIn a highly preferred embodiment therefore the invention provides a compounds of formula\n\n\n \n\n or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted above, R\n3\n and R\n4\n can be activating groups. In this regard, activating groups are those which might enhance the absorption of the compounds within the body or enhance efficacy. One aspect of the present invention relates to CNS delivery of AQP4 inhibitors using prodrugs, especially lipophilic prodrugs of AQP inhibitors for example lipophilic \n\n esters or other bioreversible derivatives. A typical lipophilic prodrug for CNS delivery has preferably a log P value above 1.5, more preferably above 2.0.\n\n\nAny compound of the invention will preferably have a Mw of less than 2000 D, preferably 300 D and 2000 D.\n\n\nPeptides, Prodrugs & Peptidomimetics\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention is to use prodrugs to obtain selectivity for AQPs. The prodrugs of the present invention are compounds which may or may not bind to the AQP proteins, but are transformed in vivo to compounds with high affinity for AQP proteins. The rationale for AQP prodrugs is to improve selectivity, to reduce side effects and toxicity, to improve stability and/or to improve drug delivery of the active AQP interacting drug.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to peptidomimetics. These are compounds which have the same biological effects as the peptide but avoid some of the potential clinical disadvantages of a peptide. These disadvantages can typically be short shelf life, low oral bioavailability and low metabolic stability.\n\n\nIn particular peptidomimetics of the invention are those in which the backbone of the peptide is altered to be different from a conventional peptide, i.e. where Y is N for example, a peptidomimetic is formed.\n\n\nThe peptide AQP ligands according to the present invention are characterized by having a non-covalent interaction with the AQP proteins. This interaction preferably has a binding affinity for an aquaporin, preferably aquaporin-4, having a dissociation constant of less than or equal to 10 micromolar, more preferably less than or equal to 1 micromolar, even more preferably less than or equal to 500 nanomolar, even more preferably less than or equal to 250 nanomolar, most preferably less than or equal to 200 nanomolar.\n\n\nThe peptide AQP modulators of the present invention are reversible modulators of AQPs. It is believed that the peptides of the invention are able to mimic the extracelluar loop C of AQPs, in particular of AQP4 and AQPO.\n\n\nIn addition, the inventors have also found a further class of peptides, thought to interfere with anchoring of AQPs, in particular AQP4. In a second aspect, therefore the invention also provides a peptide compound of formula (III) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein Y, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and Z are as hereinbefore defined; R\n6\n is an acyl group comprising 2-16 C atoms, preferably a C2-6 acyl group such as an acetyl group; and\n\n\nR\n7\n is a Ci\n-6\n alkyl, especially methyl, isopropyl, -CH\n2\nCH(Me\n2\n), or CH(Me)CH\n2\nCH\n3\n.\n\n\nPreferably the peptide is of formula (IV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore especially the peptide is of formula (V)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe preferred options for Y, Z, R\n3\n and R\n4\n above also apply to this embodiment. In particular, R\n3\n preferably represents a C terminal protecting group. R\n4\n preferably represents an additional amino acid chain having 1 to 7 units, preferably 2 to 5 units which in turn is preferably terminated with an N terminus protecting group. \n\n Preferably the first amino acid attached to the N-terminus is GIu or Asp, especially GIu. If two amino acids are added, the second amino acid is preferably GIy.\n\n\nIf three are added the third amino acid is preferably Ser or Cys. If four amino acids are added the 4th amino acid is also preferably Cys or Ser. A fifth amino acid is preferably GIu or Asp.\n\n\nAdditional units preferably form all of or part of the amino acid chain Asp-Ser- Ser-Gly-Glu, i.e. if one extra unit is added it is GIu, if two are added they are GIy and GIu etc. It is again stressed that the N-terminus amino acid should carry a protecting or activating group. It is also preferred if any GIu or Asp group which is added can be functionalised to carry a C-terminus protecting group.\n\n\nMost especially the invention provides a peptide of formula (VI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which the substituents are as hereinbefore defined. Most especially peptides of this second embodiment will have the backbone structure Asp-Ser-Ser-Gly-Glu-Val-Leu-Ser-Ser-Val in which the two serine residues nearest the C terminus carry the R\n6\n groups and the GIu residue carries an R\n3\n. The serine residues towards the N-terminus can be in their native form or carry an R\n6\n group. The Asp residue may also carry an R\n3\n.\n\n\nIt will again be appreciated that the N terminus of the formed amino acid should have a suitable protecting group or activating group thereon. Such groups are comprehensively described above. It is believed that the peptides of this second aspect can pass the blood brain barrier and inhibit AqP4 activity through antagonism of the AqP4 - PDZ domain on α- Synthropin and fits into our patent strategy in the peptide part of our patent application. \n\n Synthesis\n\n\nThe peptides can be prepared using standard methods of peptide synthesis 5 including both solid phase, solution phase chemistry and a combination of solution phase and solid phase chemistry. We exemplify the preparation of many peptides in the examples and the general procedures in these examples enable the formation of the claimed materials.\n\n\nThe synthesis of a bridge is shown in Scheme I 10\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n27: R = iPr, R\n1\n = H 29: R = iPr, R' = H\n\n\n28: R = R' = CH\n3\n 30: R = R = CH\n3\n \n\n\nScheme I\n\n\n15 Synthesis of 29: (i) Grubbs' 2nd generation catalyst (20 mol%), DCM, rt, 7h 30 min, 42%; (ii) TFA, DCM, rt, Ih 50 min, 95%; (iii) Boc-Pro-Pro-OH, EDC, HOBt, DIPEA, DCM, 0\n0\nC to rt, 21h 30 min, 78%; OR\n\n\nSynthesis of 30: (i) Grubbs' 2nd generation catalyst (15 mol%), DCM, rt, 4h 15 min, 52%; (ii) TFA, DCM, rt, 2h, 71%; (iii) Boc-Pro-Pro-OH, EDC, HOBt, DIPEA, DCM,\n\n\n20 O\n0\nC to rt, 82% \n\n Synthesis of a saturated bridging linker can be achieved easily by hydrogenation of the unsaturated linker such as that depicted above.\n\n\nDosages\n\n\nThe effective dose for treatment of a condition related to AQPs will be readily determined by the skilled man. Ideally it should be a dose resulting in unacceptable side effects for less than 1 out of 100 patients.\n\n\nThe IC50 value for modification of other pharmacological or toxicological targets should preferably be at least 100% higher than the IC50 value for modification of AQPs, more preferably at least 200% higher especially at least 300% higher, such as at least 400% higher than the IC50 value for modification of AQPs.

Cationic AQP modulators are according to the present invention preferably used as salts with pharmaceutically acceptable ions like for example chloride, sulphate, bromide, tartrate, oxalate, mesylate, maleate, citrate, phosphate, acetate, pamoate, iodide, nitrate, lactate, tosylate and besilate. \n\n The AQP modulators according to the present invention may be characterized by having a non-covalent interaction with the AQP proteins. This interaction has preferably a dissociation constant lower than 10 micromolar, more preferably a dissociation constant lower than 1 micromolar, more preferably a dissociation constant lower than 500 nanomolar, even more preferably a dissociation constant lower than 250 nanomolar, most preferably a dissociation constant lower than 200 nanomolar.\n\n\nCompositions\n\n\nViewed from a further aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an AQP ligand, more preferably an AQP modulator, even more preferably an AQP inhibitor (in particular an AQP4 ligand, modulator or inhibitor), ester, prodrug or salt thereof according to the invention together with at least one physiologically tolerable carrier or excipient. Another preferred aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a selective AQP4 modulator or inhibitor or prodrug or salt thereof according to the invention together with at least one physiologically tolerable carrier or excipient for treatment of disorders in the central nervous system.\n\n\nPreferably said modulator binds non-covalently to AQP4 in the central nervous system.\n\n\nThe carriers or excipients used in the compositions may be any of the material commonly used in pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. solvents (for example water), pH modifiers, viscosity modifiers, fillers, diluents, binders, aromas, skin penetration enhancers, antioxidants and other preservatives, etc. The choice will depend on the dosage administration route and form. Typically parenteral compositions, especially injectable compositions will be sterile.\n\n\nThe compositions of the invention may be in any convenient dosage administration form, e.g. solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, tablets, coated tablets, powders, sprays, suppositories, etc. Solutions, dispersions, capsules and tablets are preferred, especially tablets, capsules and solutions for injection.\n\n\nTablets comprising AQP modulators according to the present invention can be prepared by direct compression, wet granulation, dry granulation or fluid bed granulation. Tablets, according to the present invention, will in addition to AQP \n\n modulating substance(s) and optionally other active pharmaceutical ingredients always comprise one or more well known tablet exipients. Such tablet excipients include typically antiadherents like magnesium stearate, binders like carbohydrates as starch, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol or manitol, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone and gelatine, disintegrants like crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium starch glycolate and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, diluents and fillers like cellulose and dibasic calcium phosphate, flavors like mint, cherry vanilla, peach and apricot extracts, colours, glidants like silicon dioxide, talc and magnesium carbonate. Tablets are preferably coated with a film coating. Typical film coating materials to be used for film coated tablets according to the present invention include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Tablets might also be coated with en enteric coating. Typical enteric coating materials to be used for enteric coated tablets according to the present invention are various acrylate based polymers like Eudragit® and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP).\n\n\nCapsules are, according to the present invention, preferably hard gelatine capsules. The capsules might in addition to AQP modulating substance(s) and optionally other pharmaceutically active ingredients comprise of lactose and other additives. Ready for use solutions comprising AQP modulators according to the present invention have preferably an osmolality in the same range as osmalality in blood. The solutions are preferably isotonic with blood (osmolality of appr. 300 mθsm/kg). Hypertonic solutions might also be acceptable in the administration volume is low (less than 10 ml). Solutions for injection or infusion are sterile. The pH value for injection or infusions is preferably within range 2 to 8, more preferably between 4 and 7.4. These formulations may be prepared in conventional fashion.\n\n\nThe administration route for the compounds and compositions of the invention may be enteral, e.g. oral, rectal or by tube, nasal, sub-lingual, by injection or infusion, e.g. i.v, i.p., i.m. or s.c. or, less preferably epidural or intracerebroventricular. The daily dose of AQP modulator according to the present invention varies over a large range; depending upon medical condition and indication, severity, age and sex. A typical dose is between 0.1 mg to 3 gram daily, more preferably 0.2 mg to 2 grams \n\n daily, even more preferably 0,3 mg to 1.5 grams daily, most preferred 0.5 mg to 1 gram daily.\n\n\nThe composition of AQP modulator might, according to the present invention be administered once or several times for treatment of the medical condition. If the AQP modulator is administered several times for treatment of the same medical condition, the AQP modulator might be administered once monthly, once weekly or more frequently. The AQP modulator might be administered once daily or up to 6 times during 24 hours.\n\n\nThe dose of AQP modulator in one single unit dose may vary. Tablets and capsules might comprise from 0.1 mg to 1 gram per single dose unit, while solutions of AQP modulators might comprise of 0.1 mg to 3 grams of AQP modulator in one single dose.\n\n\nThe AQP inhibitors might, according to the present invention, be administered together with one or more other drug that do not modify AQP. The other drug(s) might be formulated in the same single dose unit (e.g tablet, capsule, solution) as the AQP modulator or might be formulated separately. If AQP modulator is used together with other drugs that do not modify AQP, the non-AQP modulating drug might be administered prior to the AQP modulating drug, together with the AQP modulating drug or after administration of the AQP modulating drug. Typical non-AQP modulating drugs to be administered together with AQP modulating drugs are dependent on indication and the medical condition. This includes for example drugs with affinity for acetylcholine receptors (including both nicotinic receptors and muscarinic receptors, agonists like for example pilocarpine, antagonists like tropane derivatives), drugs with affinity for adrenergic receptors (like for example agonists like adrenaline, beta-2 antagonists like propranolol, beta2-agonists like salbutamol, beta-agonists like isoprenaline, alpha-2 agonists like methyldopa, and alpha- 1 antagonists like ergotamine and alpha agonists like xylometazoline), drugs with affinity for GABA receptors (including barbiturates, agonists like benzodiazepines and antagonists like flumazenil), drugs with affinity for glutamate (NMDA) receptors ( including antagonists like memantine and modulators like acamprostate), drugs with affinity for angiotensin receptors (including ATI antagonists like losartan), drugs with affinity for dopamine receptors (including agonists like dopamine and antagonists like chlorpromazine), drugs with affinity for endothelin receptors (including antagonists like \n\n bosentan), drugs with affinity for histamine receptors (including Hl antagonists like diphenhydramine and H2 antagonists like ranitidine), drugs with affinity for cannabinoid receptors (including agonists like dronabinol), drugs with affinity for opioid receptors (including agonists like morphine and antagonists like buprenorphine), drugs with affinity for serotonin receptors (including all subgroups and including agonists like triptans and antagonists like quetiapine, drugs with affinity for cytokine receptors, drugs with affinity for integrin receptors, drugs with affinity for nuclear receptors, drugs that interact with ion channels like calcium channels, sodium channels, potassium channels and chloride channels, drugs that inhibit enzymes like redox enzymes, transferases, hydrolases, isomerases, lysases, Ii gases, drugs that interact with transport proteins, drugs with affinity for nucleic acids and ribosomes, monoclonal antibodies and drugs that modify various physicochemical mechanisms in the body.\n\n\nViewed from a further aspect the invention provides an AQP ligand, modulator or inhibtor or prodrug or salt thereof according to the invention for medical use. Viewed from a still further aspect the invention provides the use of a AQP ligand, modulator or inhibitor or prodrug or salt thereof according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating a condition associated with AQP, e.g. a condition of the central nervous system.\n\n\nViewed from a yet still further aspect the invention provides a method of treatment of a human which method comprises administering a AQP ligand, modulator or inhibitor to the human subject. One preferred aspect of this method is administration of AQP4 modulators or inhibitors.\n\n\nIndications\n\n\nThe conditions treated according to the invention will generally be conditions responsive to AQP ligands, modulators or inhibitors. Some of these indications are: disease conditions in the central nervous system preferably edema, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression and various psychosis, various diseases related to the urogenital system including the kidneys, conditions related to the reproductive system, Meniere's disease, Sjøgren's Syndrome, skin conditions including cosmetics and skin diseases, wound healing, obestity, eye diseases, neuromyelitis optica, various infections and cancer. \n\n The most preferred conditions to be treated are conditions responsive to AQP4 ligands, modulators or inhibitors. Such conditions may be associated for example with disease conditions in the central nervous system preferably edema, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression and various psychosis. The even most preferred conditions for AQP4 inhibitors are brain edema and stroke.\n\n\nThe invention also encompasses the use of the compounds of the invention for treatment of demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and multiple sclerosis borderline diseases, such as optic-spinal MS, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, balo concentric sclerosis, Schilder disease, Marburg multiple sclerosis and Devic's disease, also known as Devic's syndrome or neuromyelitis optica (NMO).\n\n\nA preferred aspect of the invention is use of the said compounds in treatment of NMO. NMO is an MS-like autoimmune, inflammatory disease in which the immune defense attacks the spinal cord and optic nerves. There is currently no cure for NMO. Typically, NMO has a worse outcome than MS, with frequent and early relapses. Vision and ambulation are impaired within 5 yrs of its onset in 50% of patients, and 20% succumb to respiratory failure from cervical myelitis.\n\n\nMany clinicians agree that long term immunosuppression is required to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks, while others argue the exact opposite. Commonly used immunosuppressant treatments include azathioprine (Imuran) plus prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil plus prednisone, Rituximab, Mitoxantrone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and Cyclophosphamide. The monoclonal antibody rituximab is under study. In 2007, Devic's disease was reported to be responsive to glatiramer acetate and to low-dose corticosteroids.\n\n\nThe target of the autoimmune attack has been identified to be aquaporin-4 (AQP4), in particular AQP4 orthogonal arrays. The attack is believed to be mediated by antibodies known as NMO-IgG, which bind to the extracellular surface of the protein, partly by recognition of loop C. Binding of the said compounds to AQP4 prevents binding of NMO-IgG to AQP4 and thus prevents or inhibits an autoimmune attack with subsequent demyelination. Another preferred aspect of the invention is use of the said compounds in treatment of single or recurrent events of longitudinally extensive myelitis, bilateral simultaneous or recurrent optic neuritis, Asian optic-spinal MS, longitudinally extensive myelitis or optic neuritis associated with systemic autoimmune disease and \n\n optic neuritis or myelitis associated with lesions in specific brain areas such as the hypothalamus, periventricular nucleus, and brainstem. Patients with these conditions have generally NMO-IgG seropositive status.\n\n\nThis aspect of the invention, i.e. use of the said compounds in treatment of the said conditions, is completely separate from the use of the said compounds as AQP4 inhibitors against brain edema and the compounds used for this aspect of the invention need not have any effect on the water permeability of AQP4. The only property required is binding affinity towards the extracellular part of AQP4.\n\n\nThe invention is illustrated further by the following non-limiting Examples and figure. Figure 1 shows the protein binding of radiolabeled compound 35 as a function of concentration.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n7V-tert-butoxycarbonyl L-prolyl L-proline methyl ester (1) METHOD 1 iV-terr-butoxycarbonyl L-proline (99.69 g, 0.4631 mol) was dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (800 mL).

The radioactive compound was received as an EtOH solution. The total activity of the sample was 1 mCi. and the radiological concentration was 2 mCi/mL. The specific activity was 42.9 Ci/mmol and the radiochemical purity (determined by HPLC) 99.8 %. The specific activity was determined by mass spectrometry.\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\nFemale Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g (Møllegaard, Ejby, Denmark) were used. Experimental protocols conform to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals.\n\n\nTissue preparation\n\n\nBrain cerebella (1 :5 wt/vol) in ice cold 0.3 M sucrose, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) were homogenised in clay-beads-containing tubes by Fastprep shaker and centrifuged at l,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was spun down at 42,00Og for 60 min at 4°C. The cytosolic protein containing supernatant was discarded, whereas the pellet containing the crude membranes was resuspended in ice cold 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA. Protein concentration was determined by the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad).\n\n\nRadioligand binding assay\n\n\nBinding assays were performed in 96-well, round-bottom microtiter plates with total reaction volume of 100 μl/well, containing the indicated concentration of [\n3\nH]peptide \n\n with or without competing unlabelled peptide (100 μM) in a binding buffer containing 50 niM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at RT), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, ImM ascorbate. The plates were incubated at 23EC for 60 min and harvested onto Multiscreen Harvest plate FC (Millipore, Ireland), presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Sigma), using a Packard FilterMate Universal Harvester with 96- well format, and washed as quickly as possible 4 times with approx. 0.25 ml/well of ice-cold buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0 at RT) and 2 mM MgCl\n2\n. The filters were dried and counted at approx. 40% efficiency in a Top-Count liquid scintillation counter (Packard) using 20 μl per filter well of Micro-Scint liquid scintillation cocktail (Packard).\n\n\nAnalysis of binding data\n\n\nBinding data were analysed by non-linear regression using Microsoft Excel with the Solver add-in. The non-specific binding was assumed to be linear as a function of the concentration of free [\n3\nH]peptide and analysed by linear regression. The total binding was modelled as the sum of the non-specific binding and the specific binding, defined by the equation:\n\n\nY = B\nmax *\n x / (K\nd\n + x)\n\n\nwhere B\nmax\n is the total number of specific binding sites, K\nd\n the equilibrium dissociation constant and x the concentration of free [\n3\nH]peptide.\n\n\nResults - Compound 29 (of Example 27)\n\n\nSpecific binding of [\n3\nH]peptide, defined as the difference in binding of [\n3\nH]peptide in the absence and presence of 100 μM unlabelled peptide, i.e. specific binding = total binding (binding in the absence of unlabelled peptide) - non-specific binding (binding in the presence of unlabelled peptide), was detected in crude membranes from rat cerebellum, amounting to approx. 0.5-1 pmol/mg membrane protein and with a ^d value (affinity) of about 0.1-0.2 μM. \n\n UnWeighted Weighted\n\n\nResults: weighted 1/Y 1/Y\n2\n \n\n\nKd (nM): 106,568 92,679 92,679 Bmax (fmol/mg protein): 1120 1005 1005\n\n\nBmax (cpm): 2136,5 1918,3 1918,3\n\n\nThese results are presented in Figure 1."
