This invention further relates to methods of increasing HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) levels or activity in a subject or treating a condition associated with HIF levels or activity such as ischemia, anemia, wound healing, auto-transplantation, allotransplantation, xenotransplantation, systemic high blood pressure, thalassemia, diabetes, cancer, and an inflammatory disorder. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The cellular transcription factor HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) occupies a central position in oxygen homeostasis in a wide range of organisms and is a key regulator of responses to hypoxia. The genes regulated by HIF transcriptional activity can play critical roles in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, hemoglobin F production, energy metabolism, inflammation, vasomotor function, apoptosis and cellular proliferation. HIF can also play a role in cancer, in which it is commonly upregulated, and in the pathophysiological responses to ischemia and hypoxia. \n\n\n The HIF transcriptional complex comprises an heterodimer: HIF is a constitutive nuclear protein that dimerizes with oxygen-regulated HIF subunits. Oxygen regulation occurs through hydroxylation of the HIF subunits, which are then rapidly destroyed by the proteasome. In oxygenated cells, the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) binds to hydroxylated HIF-subunits, thereby promoting their ubiquitin dependent proteolysis. This process is suppressed under hypoxic conditions, stabilizing HIF and promoting transcriptional activation by the HIF complex. \n\n\n Hydroxylation of HIF-subunits can occur on proline and asparagine residues and can be mediated by \n\n a family of 2-oxoglutarate dependent enzymes. This family includes the HIF prolyl hydroxylase isozymes (PHDs), which hydroxylate Pro 402 and Pro 564 of human HBFl, as well as Factor Inhibiting HDF (FIH), which hydroxylates Asn 803 of human HIFl. Inhibition of FEH or the PHDs leads to HIF stabilization and transcriptional activation. See, e.g., Schofield and Ratcliffe, Nature Rev. MoI. Cell Biol., VoI 5, pages 343-354 (2004). \n\n\n Thus, new or improved agents that modulate (such as increasing HDF levels or activity) HIF are continually needed for developing new and more effective pharmaceuticals to treat HDF-associated conditions or diseases or disorders, such as ischemia, anemia, wound healing, auto-transplantation, allotransplantation, xenotransplantation, systemic high blood pressure, thalassemia, diabetes, cancer, and an inflammatory disorder, to name a few. In discovering new or improved agents that modulate HIF level or activity, it is also desirable but not required to discover agents with improved chemical or biological properties such as solubility, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity and/or less side effects such as less cardiovascular side effects. The compounds, compositions, and methods described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention provides, inter alia, compounds of Formula I: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I \n\n\na pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a solvate thereof, a chelate thereof, a non-covalent complex thereof, a prodrug thereof, or a mixture of any of the foregoing, wherein constituent members are provided below. \n\n\n The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n The present invention further provides methods of modulating an activity of HD?

numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. \n\n\n As used herein, when any variable occurs more than one time in a chemical formula, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. The compounds of the present disclosure may contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and therefore, may exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers or diastereomers. Accordingly, any chemical structures within the scope of the specification depicted, in whole or in part, with a relative configuration encompass all possible enantiomers and stereoisomers of the illustrated \n\n compounds including the stereoisomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures. Enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures can be resolved into the component enantiomers or stereoisomers using separation techniques or chiral synthesis techniques well known to the skilled artisan. \n\n\n Compounds of Formula I, II, Ha, III and IHa include, but are not limited to optical isomers of compounds of Formula I, II, Ha, III and Ilia, racemates, and other mixtures thereof. In those situations, the single enantiomers or diastereomers, i.e., optically active forms, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis or by resolution of the racemates. Resolution of the racemates can be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. In addition, compounds of Formula I, II, Ha, III and HIa include Z- and E- forms (or cis- and trans- forms) of compounds with double bonds.

After its completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 500 mL of water was then added in and stirred at 5O\n0\nC until hydrolyzation is complete. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0 \n0\nC and filtered. The resulting solid, Compound 2, was further dried (47 g). \n\n\n Compound 2 (25.9 g, 100 mmol) and 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole anhydrous (HOBt, 13.5 g) was dissolved in 400 mL of THF. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 20.9 g) was gradually added in at 0 \n0\nC and stirred over night at a temperature below 10\n0\nC. The reaction mixture was filtered and the Filtrate A was collected. 13.2 g (100 mmol) of dimethyl malonate was dissolved in 800 mL of THF first, then 7.2 g sodium hydride (70% dispersion) was added in. Filtrate A was added while stirred and left to react for 2 hours at room temperature. After THF removed by vacuum distillation, 400 mL of methanol and 400 mL of 10% HCl were added and stirred over night. After filtration, the resulting solid was washed with 400 mL of methanol and dried, yielding 14 g of Compound 3. \n\n\n Glycine t-butyl ester HCl salt (13.4 g) and sodium methoxide (4.4 g) were suspended in 20OmL of methanol. After stirred to a homogeneous suspension, it was distilled to remove all methanol. 200 mL of THF and Compound 3 (6.O g) were added in and the reaction was run at 6O\n0\nC over night. THF was then \n\n removed by vacuum distillation and 400 mL of methanol was added and stirred for 2 hours. After filtration and drying, it gave 4.5 g of Compound 4. \n\n\n Compound 4 (240 mg, 0.6 mmol), Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n (140 mg, 0.12 mmol) and phenyl boronic acid (85.4 mg, 0.7 mmol) were dissolved in 1 mL of 2M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n aqueous solution and 4 mL of DMF. The resulting solution was heated to 8O\n0\nC under nitrogen gas overnight. After its completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. IOOL of water and 10OmL of ethyl acetate were added and stirred. The organic layer was retained and washed twice more by water, followed by quickly passing through a silicon gel column to remove solvent. 5mL of dichloromethane and 5mL of trifluoroacetic acid were then added and stirred at room temperature for 4 hrs. After its completion, the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo.

in 130 mL of AC\n2\nO with addition of ImL Of H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and was heated at 5O\n0\nC. After its completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 500 mL of water was then added in and stirred at 5O\n0\nC until hydrolyzation is complete. The reaction mixture was then cooled to O\n0\nC and filtered. The resulting solid, Compound 8, was further dried (24.4 g). \n\n\n Compound 8 (13 g) and 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole anhydrous (HOBt, 6.8 g) was dissolved in 200 mL of THF. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 10.4 g) was gradually added in at 0\n0\nC and stirred over night at a temperature below 1O\n0\nC. The reaction mixture was filtered and the Filtrate B was collected. 6.6 g (50 mmol)of dimethyl malonate was dissolved in 400 mL of THF first, then 3.8 g sodium hydride (70% dispersion) was added in. Filtrate B was added while stirred and left to react for 2 hours at room temperature. After THF removed by vacuum distillation, 200 mL of methanol and 200 mL of 10% HCl were added and stirred over night. After filtration, the resulting solid was washed with 200 mL of methanol and dried, yielding 6 g of Compound 9. \n\n\n Glycine t-butyl ester HCl salt (13.5 g) and sodium methoxide (4.4 g) were suspended in 200 mL of methanol. After stirred to a homogeneous suspension, it was distilled to remove all methanol. 200 mL of \n\n THF and Compound 9 (6.O g) were added in and the reaction was run at 6O\n0\nC over night. THF was then removed by vacuum distillation and 400 mL of methanol was added and stirred for 2 hours. After filtration and drying, it gave 3.5 g of Compound 10. \n\n\n Compound 10 (240 mg, 0.6 mmol), Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n (140 mg, 0.12 mmol) and phenyl boronic acid (85.4 mg, 0.7 mmol) were dissolved in 1 mL of 2M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n aqueous solution and 4 mL of DMF. The resulting solution was heated to 80\n0\nC under nitrogen gas overnight. After its completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. 10OmL of water and 100 mL of ethyl acetate were added and stirred. The organic layer was retained and washed twice more by water, followed by quickly passing through a silicon gel column to remove solvent. 5 mL of dichloromethane and 5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid were then added and stirred at room temperature for 4 hrs. After its completion, the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo.
