Description\n\n\n\n\n ANTI-PAI-1 ANTIBODIES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n [001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. \n\n\n 61/330,584 filed on May 3, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/330,692 filed on May 3, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein. \n\n\nFIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE \n\n\n [002] The present disclosure relates to antibody molecules which bind plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). The antibodies are useful for inhibiting thrombosis and stimulating clot lysis. The antibodies are useful for treating or decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and conditions, such as angina, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, cardiac insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral artery occlusive disease and stroke. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE \n\n\n [003] The fibrinolytic system plays important roles in physiologic events such as thrombolysis. The fibrinolytic system is activated when plasminogen activator (PA) converts plasminogen to plasmin. Tissue plasminogen activator converts plasminogen (i.e., the precursor of plasmin) to plasmin. Plasmin converts fibrin to a fibrin degradation product by breaking it down. Plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI-1) is a major regulatory component of the plasminogen-plasmin system. PAI-1 is a serine protease, and this protease is the principal physiologic inhibitor of both tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Increased PAI-1 levels are associated with various conditions, including ischemic heart diseases such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and cardiac insufficiency. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE \n\n\n [004] There is a need for anti-PAI-1 antibodies with favorable properties, such as specificity for human PAI-1, cross-reactivity with species used as disease models, affinity, ability to inhibit PAI-1 function without inhibiting binding to vitronectin, etc. The present disclosure provides such antibodies. Anti-PAI-1 antibodies having such favorable properties can \n\n be used in a variety of in vivo and ex vivo methods, such as in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and conditions. \n\n\n [005] In a first aspect, the disclosure provides a purified or isolated human or chimeric antibody or antibody fragment that immunospecifically binds to human PAI-1 and mouse PAI-1.

Introduction \n\n\n [099] The present disclosure provides antibodies, including human, humanized and/or chimeric forms, as well as fragments, derivatives/conjugates and compositions thereof that immunospecifically bind to PAI-1. Anti-PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments are also referred to interchangeably herein as antibodies of the disclosure. \n\n\n [0100] PAI-1 belongs to the serine protease inhibitors (serpin) family. Serpins and their homologues are a group of high molecular weight (40 to 50 kDa) structurally related proteins involved in a number of fundamental biological processes, such as blood coagulation, complement activation, fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, inflammation, tumour suppression, and hormone transport. All known serpins have been classified into 16 clades and 10 orphan sequences; the vertebrate serpins can be conveniently classified into six sub-groups. In human \n\n plasma the serpins represent approximately 2% of the total protein, of which 70% is alpha- 1- antitrypsin. \n\n\n [0101] PAI-1 is a single-chain glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa. The protein consists of 379 or 381 amino acids due to N-terminal heterogeneity and has a 23 amino acid signal peptide indicating that it is a secreted protein. \n\n\n [0102] The consensus coding sequence for the human PAI-1 gene, SERPINE1, is that of sequence NM 000602 indicating that NM 000602 (gi: 10835158) represents the most common sequence (SEQ ID NO: 119 in the appended Sequence Listing). In addition to the coding changes, 5 polymorphisms were observed in the 5' promoter region (including the 4G/5G polymorphism), 1 polymorphism was observed in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), 12 polymorphisms were observed in the 3 'UTR and a number of additional non-coding changes were also observed. \n\n\n [0103] The identity of PAI-1 at the amino acid level across species is about 78 or 79% for mouse, about 80% for rat and about 86% for dog. The homology of PAI-1 to other members of the serpin family is relatively low. PAI-1 shares 25% identity with PAI-2 and 26% with PAI- 3. The most closely related members of the serpin family are Protease nexin 1 (SERPINE2) which shows 37% identity with PAI-1, neuroserpin (SERPINIl) with 29% identity and pancpin (SERPINI2) with 28% identity. \n\n\n [0104] PAI-1 is a fast-acting and highly selective inhibitor of target proteinases such as tPA and uPA. PAI-1 inhibits its target proteinases by formation of an initial 1 : 1 stoichiometric complex which is non-covalent and reversible. A covalent complex is then formed and PAI-1 is cleaved such that PAI-1 acts as a \"suicide inhibitor\". PAI-1 has been identified in both active and latent conformations in vivo. In the active form, the reactive centre loop is exposed and the P1P1 ' bond, comprising Arg346 and Met347, is able to interact with the target proteinases. Incubation of tPA or uPA with active PAI-1 leads to the formation of the covalent PAI- 1 :tPA/uPA complex upon the formation of an ester bond between the active site serine of tPA or uPA and the PI residue of the PAI-1 reactive centre loop . However, the active form is unstable and spontaneously converts to the latent form with a half-life of 1-2 hours at 37 °C. The crystal structures of active PAI-1 (Sharp, A.M. et al, 1999 Structure, 7, 111-118), latent PAI-1 \n\n\n(Mottonen, J. et al, 1992 Nature, 355, 270-273) and reactive centre cleaved PAI-1 (Aertgeerts, K. et al, 1995 Nature Struct. Biol, 2, 891-897) have been solved. In certain embodiments of \n\n the present disclosure, a preferred antibody or antibody fragment is one that specifically binds to the reactive center loop of human PAI-1. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment is only able to bind to the reactive center loop of human PAI-1 when PAI-1 is in the active form (e.g., when the reactive center loop is exposed). \n\n\n [0105] uPA is secreted from cells as a pro-enzyme. uPA catalyses the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, and active plasmin is responsible for degrading the fibrin component of clots. tPA mediated plasminogen activation is mainly involved in the dissolution of fibrin in the circulation, and tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation has been traditionally associated with thrombolysis. PAI-1 is stabilized in the active conformation by binding to vitronectin (Declerck, P.J. et al, 1988 J Biol Chem., 263, 15454-15461) and the high affinity binding region for PAI-1 in vitronectin has been mapped to the somatomedin B domain (Seiffert,D. & Loskutoff, D.J. 1991 J Biol Chem., 266, 2824-2830). \n\n\n [0106] Native glycosylation of PAI-1 is biologically significant and it has been shown that glycosylated and non-glycosylated PAI-1 react differently to inactivating monoclonal antibodies and to solvent composition. \n\n\n [0107] Small molecular weight inhibitors of PAI-1 have been reported in the literature.\n\n\nTiplaxtinin, an indole acetic acid derivative (Elokdah, H. et al., 2004 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 47, 3491-3494; WO03/000253, 2003) has been recently reported, and a derivative of this compound, PAI-749, is reported to be in Phase 1 development for thrombosis. Use of small molecule PAI-1 inhibitors for thrombosis have also been reported (Liang, A. et al., 2005 \n\n\nThrombosis Research, 115, 341-350; Charlton, P.A. et al, 1996 Thromb. Haemost., 75, SOS- SIS). \n\n\n [0108] The present disclosure provides antibodies and antibody fragments (antibodies of the disclosure) the specifically bind human PAI-1 and inhibit PAI-1 activity. For example, antibodies of the disclosure specifically bind human PAI-1 and inhibit one or more of the protease activity of human PAI-1, the binding of human PAI-1 to uPA, or the binding of human PAI-1 to tPA. By inhibit the binding of human PAI-1 to uPA and/or tPA is meant that the antibody or antibody fragment inhibits binding by at least about 40%, 50%, 60%>, 70%>, 75%>, 80%, 85% or at least 90%. In certain embodiments, binding is inhibited by greater than 90% (91 ), 92%), 93%), 94%o, 95%>, etc.). Antibodies of the disclosure have use in, for example, in vitro or in vivo diagnostics, and for the treatment of cardiovascular indications caused in whole \n\n or in part by thrombosis or increased risk of thrombosis. Antibodies of the disclosure may have other functional or structural features, as described herein. Such features include, but are not limited to, affinity for human PAI-1, affinity for mouse PAI-1, affinity for cynomolgous PAI-1, amino acid sequence, and the like. The disclosure contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind to human PAI-1 and have any one or more of the combinations of features described herein. The disclosure further contemplates that any such antibodies can be used in the diagnosis or treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein. \n\n\n[0109] By way of example, in certain embodiments, antibodies (including fragments) of the disclosure may inhibit formation of the initial complex between PAI-1 and its target proteinase tPA and/or uPA. Inhibition of binding or complex formation by the antibodies may be direct inhibition. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the disclosure may optionally promote transformation or conversion of active PAI-1 to latent PAI-1. \n\n\n[0110] Antibodies which bind to PAI-1, also referred to as anti-PAI-1 antibodies, are described herein. The antibodies bind and may neutralise (e.g., inhibit any or all activities) human PAI-1 and rodent (e.g., rat and/or mouse) PAI-1. The antibodies may bind and may neutralise rat, mouse and/or other rodent PAI-1, or lagomorph PAI-1, e.g., rabbit PAI-1, and/or non-human primate PAI-1 e.g., cynomolgus PAI-1, and/or canine PAI-1. Non-human PAI-1 refers to an ortholog of PAI-1 that occurs naturally in a species other than human. \n\n\n[0111] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure bind specifically to the reactive center loop of human PAI-1 that interacts with tPA and uPA. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the disclosure binds to the same epitope as any of the antibodies detailed in the Examples, Tables or Sequence Listing. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the disclosure binds to the same epitope as Antibody 8. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the disclosure binds to the same epitope as an antibody having the six CDRs of Antibody 8. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies bind the same epitope as an antibody comprising the three CDRs of Antibody 8 variable heavy chain. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the disclosure competes with any of the antibodies detailed in the Examples, Tables, and Sequence Listing, such as antibody 8, for binding to human PAI-1. Additional features of antibodies according to the disclosure are described herein. \n\n\n [0112] As used herein, the terms \"antibody\" and \"antibodies\", also known as \n\n\nimmunoglobulins, encompass monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal \n\n antibodies), multispecific antibodies formed from at least two different epitope binding fragments (e.g., bispecific antibodies), human antibodies, humanized antibodies, camelised antibodies, chimeric antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, antibody fragments that exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g., the antigen binding portion), disulfide-linked Fvs (dsFv), and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the disclosure ), intrabodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain at least one antigen-binding site. \n\n\nImmunoglobulin molecules can be of any isotype (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), subisotype (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or allotype (e.g., Gm, e.g., Glm(f, z, a or x), G2m(n), G3m(g, b, or c), Am, Em, and Km(l, 2 or 3)). Antibodies may be derived from any mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, monkeys, pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, cats, mice, etc., or other animals such as birds (e.g., chickens). \n\n\n [0113] Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains (CH). Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain (CL) at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Light chains are classified as either lambda chains or kappa chains based on the amino acid sequence of the light chain constant region. The variable domain of a kappa light chain may also be denoted herein as VK. \n\n\n [0114] The antibodies of the disclosure include full length or intact antibody, antibody fragments, native sequence antibody or amino acid variants, human, humanized, post- translationally modified, chimeric or fusion antibodies, immunoconjugates, and functional fragments thereof. The antibodies can be modified in the Fc region to provide desired effector functions or serum half-life. As discussed in more detail in the sections below, with the \n\n appropriate Fc regions, the naked antibody bound on the cell surface can induce cytotoxicity, e.g., via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or by recruiting complement in complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), or by recruiting nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express one or more effector ligands that recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell in antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), or some other mechanism. Alternatively, where it is desirable to eliminate or reduce effector function, so as to minimize side effects or therapeutic complications, certain other Fc regions may be used. The Fc region of the antibodies of the disclosure can be modified to increase the binding affinity for FcRn and thus increase serum half-life. Alternatively, the Fc region can be conjugated to PEG or albumin to increase the serum half-life, or some other conjugation that results in the desired effect. \n\n\n [0115] In certain embodiments, the antibody competes for binding or binds substantially to, the same epitope as the antibodies of the disclosure. Antibodies having one or more biological characteristics (e.g., potency, PAI-1 affinity, effector function, ortholog binding affinity, neutralization, etc.) of the present anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure are also contemplated. \n\n\n [0116] Functional and structural features of antibodies of the disclosure can be evaluated using any one of more of the assays described herein, as well as assays known in the art. \n\n\n[0117] The disclosure provides a composition comprising an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure and a carrier. For the purposes of treating cardiovascular disease, compositions can be administered to the patient in need of such treatment, wherein the composition can comprise one or more anti-PAI-1 antibodies present, optionally, as an immunoconjugate or as the naked antibody. In a further embodiment, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with other therapeutic agents or therapeutic regimens appropriate for the disease or condition being treated, such as beta-blockers, aspirin, a dietary regimen, an exercise regimen, or stress management. The disclosure also provides formulations comprising an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure and a carrier. In one embodiment, the formulation is a therapeutic formulation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Antibodies for use in the treatment of a cardiovascular disease or condition can be administered systemically or locally. Local administration includes via stent, catheter, or wire. \n\n [0118] In certain embodiments the disclosure provides methods useful for treating a PAI-\n\n\n1 associated cardiovascular disease/condition and/or preventing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms of the PAI-1 associated cardiovascular disease in a mammal, comprising \n\n\nadministering a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-PAI-1 antibody to the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittently as directed by a physician. \n\n\n [0119] In certain embodiments, the disclosure also provides articles of manufacture comprising at least an anti-PAI-1 antibody, such as sterile dosage forms and kits. The kits containing anti-PAI-1 antibodies find use, e.g., for purification or immunoprecipitation of PAI-1 from cells. For example, for isolation and purification of PAI-1, the kit can contain an anti-PAI-1 antibody coupled to beads (e.g., sepharose beads). Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies for detection and quantitation of PAI-1 in vitro, e.g., in an ELISA or a Western blot. Such antibody useful for detection may be provided with a label such as a fluorescent or radiolabel. Moreover, anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure can be used (including packaged for use) as a reagent to inhibit coagulation in blood products ex vivo. Antibodies of the disclosure may also be used as anti-coagulants for treatment of blood and blood products to inhibit clotting, prolong clotting time and/or inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro or ex vivo, e.g., in blood or blood products used in dialysis or transfusion and/or for storage of blood or blood products in the fluid phase. \n\n\n [0120] More details of the antibodies of the disclosure are provided below. Antibodies having any combination of the structural and/or functional features described herein can be used in vitro or in vivo in any of the methods, including diagnostic and therapeutic methods, described herein. \n\n\nB. Terminology \n\n\n [0121] Before describing the present disclosure in detail, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to specific compositions or process steps, as such may vary. It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular form \"a\", \"an\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. \n\n\n[0122] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure is related. For example, the Concise Dictionary of Biomedicine and Molecular \n\n Biology, Juo, Pei-Show, 2nd ed., 2002, CRC Press; The Dictionary of Cell and Molecular Biology, 3rd ed., 1999, Academic Press; and the Oxford Dictionary Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Revised, 2000, Oxford University Press, provide one of skill with a general dictionary of many of the terms used in this disclosure. \n\n\n Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature \n\n\nCommission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes. \n\n\n [0123] The numbering of amino acids in the variable domain, complementarity determining region (CDRs) and framework regions (FR), of an antibody follow, unless otherwise indicated, the Kabat definition as set forth in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of \n\n\nImmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insertion (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g., residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence. Maximal alignment of framework residues frequently requires the insertion of \"spacer\" residues in the numbering system, to be used for the Fv region. In addition, the identity of certain individual residues at any given Kabat site number may vary from antibody chain to antibody chain due to interspecies or allelic divergence. \n\n\n C. Anti-PAI-1 Antibodies \n\n\n [0124] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are isolated and/or purified and/or pyrogen free antibodies. The term \"purified\" as used herein, refers to other molecules, e.g., polypeptide, nucleic acid molecule that have been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its environment. Thus, in one embodiment the antibodies of the disclosure are purified antibodies wherein they have been separated from one or more components of their natural environment. The term \"isolated antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibody molecules having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an \n\n isolated antibody that specifically binds to PAI-1 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than PAI-1; however a bi- or multi-specific antibody molecule is an isolated antibody when substantially free of other antibody molecules). Thus, in one embodiment the antibodies of the disclosure are isolated antibodies wherein they have been separated from antibodies with a different specificity. Typically an isolated antibody is a monoclonal antibody. An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of human PAI-1 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens, e.g., from other species (e.g., PAI-1 species homologs). Moreover, an isolated antibody of the disclosure may be substantially free of one or more other cellular materials and/or chemicals and is herein referred to an isolated and purified antibody. In one embodiment of the disclosure, a combination of \"isolated\" monoclonal antibodies relates to antibodies having different specificities and being combined in a well defined composition. Methods of production and purification/isolation of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are described below in more detail. \n\n\n [0125] Antibodies of the present disclosure include, in certain embodiments, antibody amino acid sequences disclosed herein encoded by any suitable polynucleotide, or any isolated or formulated antibody. Further, antibodies of the present disclosure comprise antibodies having the structural and/or functional features of anti-PAI-1 antibodies described herein. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibody binds human PAI-1 and, thereby partially or substantially alters at least one biological activity of PAI-1 (e.g., binding, catalytic activity, etc.). \n\n\n[0126] Anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure immunospecifically bind at least one specified epitope specific to the PAI-1 protein, peptide, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof and do not specifically bind to other polypeptides, other than PAI-1 from other species. The at least one epitope can comprise at least one antibody binding region that comprises at least one portion of the PAI-1 protein. The term \"epitope\" as used herein refers to a protein determinant capable of binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non-conformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. \n\n\n[0127] In certain embodiments, the epitope is comprised of at least one extracellular, soluble, hydrophilic, external or cytoplasmic portion of the PAI-1. In certain embodiments, \n\n antibodies of the disclosure bind to the same epitope as Antibody 8. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the disclosure bind to the reactive loop of PAI-1 that mediates binding of PAI-1 to tPA and uPA. \n\n\n [0128] Exemplary antibodies are provided herein. The features of such exemplary antibodies are set forth in the Sequence Listing, tables, and examples. \n\n\n 1. Variable Regions \n\n\n [0129] The antigen-binding portion of an antibody comprises one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., PAI-1). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full- length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al, (1989) Nature 341 :544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. \n\n\nAntigen-binding portions can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins. \n\n\n [0130] The present anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise at least one antigen binding domain.\n\n\nSee Table 16 and the Sequence Listing for a representation of VH and VL sequences \n\n\nencompassed in the present disclosure which can be present in any combination to form a present anti-PAI-1 antibody. In certain embodiments, an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure comprises a combination of any of the VH and VL sequences according to Table 2, Table 16 and \n\n the Sequence Listing, wherein the antibody inhibits binding of human PAI-1 to tPA, but does not inhibit binding of human PAI-1 to vitronectin. \n\n\n [0131] In one embodiment, the VH is selected from any of the VH represented in SEQ\n\n\nID NOs: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 70, 74, 78, 82, 86, 90, 94, 98, 102, 106, and 110). \n\n\n [0132] In another embodiment, the VL is selected from any of the VL represented in\n\n\nSEQ ID NOs: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, and 112). \n\n\n [0133] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are human or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are human antibodies or antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are human or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments that immunospecifically bind to human PAI-1 and inhibit PAI-1 activity. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are human or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments that immunospecifically bind to human PAI-1 and inhibit binding of human PAI-1 to tPA, but do not inhibit binding of human PAI-1 to vitronectin. \n\n\n[0134] In certain embodiments, the purified anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise a VH and/or\n\n\nVL that has a given percent identify to at least one of the VH and/or VL sequences disclosed in Table 16 and the Sequence Listing. As used herein, the term \"percent (%) sequence identity\", also including \"homology\" is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues or nucleotides in the reference sequences after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Optimal alignment of the sequences for comparison may be produced, besides manually, by means of the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Ads App. Math. 2, 482, by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443, by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444, or by means of computer programs which use these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, BLAST P, BLAST N and TFASTA in Wisconsin \n\n\nGenetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.). \n\n [0135] In a specific embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise a VH amino acid sequence having at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or having at least 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. \n\n\n [0136] In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies have a VH amino acid sequence having at least, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. \n\n\n [0137] In a further embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprising a VH amino acid sequence with a given percent identify to SEQ ID NO: 6 have at least two or more (at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.) of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n\n [0138] In a further embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise a VH amino acid sequence having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 amino acid residue substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 6. In certain embodiments, the substitutions are conservative amino acid substitutions. \n\n\n [0139] In a further embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprising a VH amino acid sequence with a given number of substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 6 have at least two or more (at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.) of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n\n[0140] In a specific embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise a VL amino acid sequence having at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8. \n\n\n [0141] In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies have a VL amino acid sequence having at least, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8. \n\n\n [0142] In a further embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprising a VL amino acid sequence with a given percent identify to SEQ ID NO: 8 have at least two or more (at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.) of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n\n [0143] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise a VL amino acid sequence having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 amino acid residue substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 8.

Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) \n\n\n [0219] While the variable domain (VH and VL) comprises the antigen-binding region; the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in segments called Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), both in the light chain (VL or VK) and the heavy chain (VH) variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see, Kabat et al., Supra). The three CDRs of the heavy chain are designated CDR- Hl, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3, and the three CDRs of the light chain are designated CDR-Ll, CDR- L2, and CDR-L3. The Kabat numbering system is used herein. As such, CDR-H1 begins at approximately amino acid 31 (i.e., approximately 9 residues after the first cysteine residue), includes approximately 5-7 amino acids, and ends at the next tyrosine residue.

\n\n\n a VH CDR2 having the amino acid sequence GIIPX^X^ANYX^KX x\n6\n, wherein\n\n\nX\n1\n is an amino acid chosen from He, Thr, and Ala; \n\n\n X\n2\n is an amino acid chosen from Asp, Gly, Val, Ser, and Pro; \n\n\n X\n3\n is an amino acid chosen from Ala and Ser; \n\n\n X\n4\n is an amino acid chosen from Phe and Leu; \n\n\n X\n5\n is an amino acid chosen from Gin and Arg; \n\n\n X\n6\n is an amino acid chosen from Gly and Ser; \n\n\n a VH CDR3 having the amino acid sequence EX\n1\nRQWLEGX\n2\nFDY, wherein \n\n\n X\n1\n is an amino acid chosen from Lys and Arg; \n\n\n X\n2\n is an amino acid chosen from Arg, and His; \n\n\n a VL CDRl having the amino acid sequence X\n1\nASEX\n2\nIYX\n3\nX\n4\nLA, wherein \n\n\n X\n1\n is an amino acid chosen from Arg and Gin;

Exemplary antibodies of the disclosure have such sequence (structure), bind specifically to human PAI-1 and have at least two or more (at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.) of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n\n[0311] The present disclosure encompasses anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprising amino acids in a sequence that is substantially the same as an amino acid sequence described herein. Amino acid sequences that are substantially the same as the sequences described herein include sequences comprising conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as amino acid deletions \n\n and/or insertions. A conservative amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of a first amino acid by a second amino acid that has chemical and/or physical properties (e.g, charge, structure, polarity, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) that are similar to those of the first amino acid. Conservative substitutions include replacement of one amino acid by another within the following groups: lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H); aspartate (D) and glutamate (E); asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), K, R, H, D and E; alanine (A), valine (V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), methionine (M), cysteine (C) and glycine (G); F, W and Y; C, S and T. Similarly contemplated is replacing a basic amino acid with another basic amino acid (e.g., replacement among Lys, Arg, His), replacing an acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid (e.g., replacement among Asp and Glu), replacing a neutral amino acid with another neutral amino acid (e.g., replacement among Ala, Gly, Ser, Met, Thr, Leu, He, Asn, Gin, Phe, Cys, Pro, Trp, Tyr, Val). \n\n\n[0312] The foregoing applies equally to anti-PAI antibodies and antibody fragments of the disclosure. Antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the foregoing functional and structural characteristics are contemplated. \n\n\n 3. Framework regions \n\n\n[0313] The variable domains of the heavy and light chains each comprise four framework regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4), which are the more highly conserved portions of the variable domains. The four FRs of the heavy chain are designated FR-H1, FR-H2, FR-H3 and FR-H4, and the four FRs of the light chain are designated FR-L1, FR-L2, FR-L3 and FR-L4. The Kabat numbering system is used herein, See Table 1, Kabat et al, Supra. As such, FR-H1 begins at position 1 and ends at approximately amino acid 30, FR-H2 is approximately from amino acid 36 to 49, FR-H3 is approximately from amino acid 66 to 94 and FR-H4 is approximately amino acid 103 to 113. FR-L1 begins at amino acid 1 and ends at approximately amino acid 23, FR-L2 is approximately from amino acid 35 to 49, FR-L3 is approximately from amino acid 57 to 88 and FR-L4 is approximately from amino acid 98 to 107. In certain embodiments the framework regions may contain substitutions according to the Kabat numbering system, e.g., insertion at 106 A in FR-L1. In addition to naturally occurring substitutions, one or more alterations {e.g., substitutions) of FR residues may also be introduced in an anti-PAI- 1 antibody. In certain embodiments, these result in an improvement or optimization in the binding affinity of the antibody for PAI-1, for example one or more of human, mouse, or cynomolgous PAI-1. \n\n Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al, Science, 233:747-753 (1986)); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al, J. Mol. Biol, 196:901-917 (1987)); and/or participate in the VL-VH interface (US Patent No. 5,225,539). \n\n\n [0314] In another embodiment the FR may comprise one or more amino acid changes for the purposes of \"germlining\". For example, the amino acid sequences of selected antibody heavy and light chains are compared to germline heavy and light chain amino acid sequences and where certain framework residues of the selected VL and/or VH chains differ from the germline configuration (e.g., as a result of somatic mutation of the immunoglobulin genes used to prepare the phage library), it may be desirable to \"backmutate\" the altered framework residues of the selected antibodies to the germline configuration (i.e., change the framework amino acid sequences of the selected antibodies so that they are the same as the germline framework amino acid sequences). Such \"backmutation\" (or \"germlining\") of framework residues can be accomplished by standard molecular biology methods for introducing specific mutations (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis; PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and the like). In one embodiment, the variable light and/or heavy chain framework residues are backmutated. In another embodiment, the variable heavy chain of an antibody of the disclosure is backmutated. In another \n\n\nembodiment, the variable heavy chain of an antibody of the disclosure comprises at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four or more backmutations. \n\n\n [0315] In certain embodiments, the VH of an anti-PAI- 1 antibody of the disclosure may comprise FR1, FR2, FR3 and/or FR4 that has an amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding framework regions (i.e., FR1 of antibody X as compared to FR1 of antibody Y) of any one or more of the VH chains of the anti-PAI antibodies described herein and set forth in the Sequence Listing, that is from about 65% to about 100%. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies comprise a VH FR amino acid sequence (FR1, FR2, FR3 and/or FR4) having at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or at least 100% sequence identity with the \n\n\ncorresponding FR of the VH set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 6, 10, 34, 66, 82, or 110. In a further embodiment the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies comprise a VH FR amino acid sequence (FR1, FR2, FR3 and/or FR4) having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having at least 100% sequence identity with the corresponding FR of the VH set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 6, 10, 34, 66, 82, or 110. \n\n [0316] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies may comprise a VH FR (FRl ,\n\n\nFR2, FR3 and/or FR4) having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1 , 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions relative to the corresponding FR of the VH set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 6, 10, 34, 66, 82, or 1 10. In particular FRl , FR2, FR3 or FR4 of the VH may each have an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1 , 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions relative to the corresponding FRl , FR2, FR3 or FR4 of the VH set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 6, 10, 34, 66, 82, or 1 10. \n\n\n [0317] In certain embodiments, the VL of an anti-PAI- 1 antibody of the disclosure may comprise FRl , FR2, FR3 and/or FR4 that has an amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding framework regions (i.e., FRl of antibody X as compared to FRl of antibody Y) of any one or more of the VH chains of the anti-PAI antibodies described herein and set forth in the Sequence Listing, that is from about 65% to about 100%. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies comprise a VL FR amino acid sequence (FRl , FR2, FR3 and/or FR4) having at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or at least 100% sequence identity with the \n\n\ncorresponding FR of the VL chains set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 8, 12, 36, 68, 84, or 1 12. In a further embodiment the anti-PAI-1 antibodies comprise a VL FR amino acid sequence (FRl , FR2, FR3 and/or FR4) having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%), 98%o, 99%) or having at least 100% sequence identity with the corresponding FR of the VL chains set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 8, 12, 36, 68, 84, or 1 12. \n\n\n[0318] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies may comprise a VL FR (FRl ,\n\n\nFR2, FR3 and/or FR4) having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1 , 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions relative to the corresponding FR of the VL chains set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 8, 12, 36, 68, 84, or 1 12. In particular FRl , FR2, FR3 or FR4 of the VL may each have an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1 , 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions relative to the corresponding FR of the VL chains set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 8, 12, 36, 68, 84, or 1 12. \n\n\n [0319] In a further embodiment, of any of the foregoing, the antibodies of the disclosure immunospecifically binds human PAI-1 , have frameworks as described above, and have one or more of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n [0320] It should be understood that antibodies defined based on possessing any one or more of the foregoing properties possesses, at least, such one or more properties but may also possess other functional or structural characteristics. \n\n\n [0321] The foregoing applies equally to antibodies and antibody fragments of the present disclosure. Moreover, the disclosure contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the functional and structural properties described in the applications, and further comprising any combination of VH FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4 regions described herein. Moreover, the disclosure contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the functional and structural properties described in the applications, and further comprising any combination of VL FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4 regions described herein, as well as antibodies and antibody fragments having any combination of VH FRl, FR2, FR3, FR4 regions, and VL FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4 regions. Moreover, the disclosure contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments comprising any combination of VL FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4 regions described herein, as well as antibodies and antibody fragments having any combination of VH FRl, FR2, FR3, FR4 regions, and VL FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4 regions. In certain \n\n\nembodiments, said antibody is a human, humanized or chimeric antibody. \n\n\n [0322] The foregoing description applies equally to antibodies and antibody fragments of the disclosure. Moreover, the disclosure contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments having any combination of the structural and/or functional features described herein. Further, the various CDR and FR domains (CDRs 1-3 of the VH domain, CDRs 1-3 of the VL domain, FRs 1-4 of the VH domain, FRs 1-4 of the VL domain) described above can be defined with other features of the disclosure described herein. Any such anti-PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments can be used in any of the methods described herein. \n\n\n [0323] Note that certain of the CDR and FR regions provided in the Sequence Listing may correspond to the same amino acid sequence (e.g., VH CDR2 from two different antibodies identified in the examples may have the same sequence). They are provided separately to illustrate the experimental results, as well as the relationships among certain antibodies identified. However, when a sequence identifier is used to describe the sequence of a particular antibody, it should be understood, unless otherwise specified, to refer to the underlying sequence itself without requiring or assuming a source of that sequence. \n\n 4. Nucleotide Sequences encoding anti-PAI-1 antibodies \n\n\n [0324] In addition to the amino acid sequences described above, the disclosure further provides nucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequences and encoding for the human, humanized and/or chimeric antibodies of the disclosure. In one embodiment, the disclosure provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PAI-1 antibody described herein or fragments thereof. These include, but are not limited to, nucleotide sequences that code for the above referenced amino acid sequences. Thus, the present disclosure also provides polynucleotide sequences encoding VH and VL domain regions including CDRs and FRs of antibodies described herein as well as expression vectors for their efficient expression in cells (e.g. mammalian cells). Methods of making the anti-PAI-1 antibodies using \n\n\npolynucleotides are described below in more detail and are known in the art. The foregoing polynucleotides encode anti-PAI-1 antibodies having the structural and/or functional features described herein. For example, such antibodies bind immunspecifically to human PAI-1 and mouse PAI-1. \n\n\n [0325] The disclosure also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined herein, to polynucleotides that encode an antibody of the disclosure described herein that binds to PAI-1. The term \"stringency\" as used herein refers to experimental conditions (e.g. temperature and salt concentration) of a hybridization experiment to denote the degree of homology between the probe and the filter bound nucleic acid; the higher the stringency, the higher percent homology between the probe and filter bound nucleic acid. \n\n\n [0326] Stringent hybridization conditions include, but are not limited to, hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 6X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45°C followed by one or more washes in 0.2X SSC/0.1% SDS at about 50-65°C, highly stringent conditions such as hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 6X SSC at about 45°C followed by one or more washes in 0.1X SSC/0.2% SDS at about 65°C, or any other stringent hybridization conditions known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Ausubel, F.M. et al, eds. 1989 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, vol. 1, Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY at pages 6.3.1 to 6.3.6 and 2.10.3). \n\n\n [0327] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide sequences of the disclosure may also comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PAI-1 antibody VH that hybridizes under \n\n stringent conditions to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 and/or any of the particular anti-PAI-1 antibody VH sequences provided in the tables and Sequence Listing. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide sequences of the disclosure may also comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PAI-1 antibody VL that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 and/or any of the particular anti-PAI-1 antibody VL sequences provided in the tables and Sequence Listing. \n\n\n [0328] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide sequences of the disclosure may also comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PAI-1 antibody VH at least 65%, 70%>, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or having about 100% identity to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 and/or any of the particular anti-PAI-1 antibody VH sequences provided in the tables and Sequence Listing. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies have a VH nucleotide sequence having at least, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having about 100% identity to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 and/or any of the particular anti-PAI-1 antibody VH sequences provided in the tables and Sequence Listing. \n\n\n [0329] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide sequences of the disclosure may also comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-PAI-1 antibody VL at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or having about 100% identity to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:7 and/or any of the particular anti-PAI-1 antibody VL sequences provided in the tables and Sequence Listing. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies have a VL nucleotide sequence having at least, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having about 100% identity to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 and/or any of the particular anti-PAI-1 antibody VL sequences provided in the tables and Sequence Listing. \n\n\n [0330] Substantially identical sequences may be polymorphic sequences, i.e., alternative sequences or alleles in a population. An allelic difference may be as small as one base pair. Substantially identical sequences may also comprise mutagenized sequences, including sequences comprising silent mutations. A mutation may comprise one or more residue changes, a deletion of one or more residues, or an insertion of one or more additional residues. \n\n\n[0331] The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. For example, if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al, \n\n BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR. \n\n\n[0332] A polynucleotide encoding an antibody may also be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably \n\n\npolyA+RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody ) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3' and 5' ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art. \n\n\n [0333] Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions. \n\n\n 5. Biological Characteristics of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies \n\n\n [0334] An antibody having a biological characteristic of a designated antibody is one which possesses one or more of the biological characteristics of that antibody which distinguish it from other antibodies that bind to the same antigen, PAI-1. As used here, \"biological characteristics\" of an antibody refers to any one of biochemical, binding and functional characteristics, which are used to select antibodies for therapeutic, research, and diagnostic uses described below. \n\n [0335] The biochemical characteristics of the antibodies of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, isoelectric point (pi) and melting temperature (Tm). The binding characteristics of the antibodies of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, binding specificity, dissociation constant (Kd), or its inverse, association constant (Ka), or its component kon or koff rates, epitope, ability to distinguish between various forms and/or preparations of PAI-1 (e.g., recombinant, native, acetylated) and ability to bind soluble and/or immobilized antigen. The functional characteristics of the antibodies of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to; inhibition of PAI-1 activity, ability to bind active PAI-1 preferentially (in some instances) to latent PAI-1, ability to bind the PAI-1 :vitronectin complex, ability to inhibit binding of PAI-1 to tPA, cross-reactivity with PAI-1 from one or more non-human species, lack of cross-reactivity with PAI-2 and PAI-3, etc. Described herein are the antibodies of the disclosure and their respective characteristics along with methods for the modification and fine tuning of those characteristics. Methods for measuring the characteristics of the antibodies are well known in the art, some of which are detailed below and in the examples. \n\n\n b) Biochemical Characteristics \n\n\n[0336] Antibodies like all polypeptides have an Isoelectric Point (pi), which is generally defined as the pH at which a polypeptide carries no net charge. It is known in the art that protein solubility is typically lowest when the pH of the solution is equal to the isoelectric point (pi) of the protein. As used herein the pi value is defined as the pi of the predominant charge form. The pi of a protein may be determined by a variety of methods including but not limited to, isoelectric focusing and various computer algorithms (see, e.g., Bjellqvist et al., 1993, \n\n\nElectrophoresis 14: 1023). In addition, the thermal melting temperatures (Tm) of the Fab domain of an antibody, can be a good indicator of the thermal stability of an antibody and may further provide an indication of the shelf-life. A lower Tm indicates more aggregation/less stability, whereas a higher Tm indicates less aggregation/ more stability. Thus, in certain embodiments antibodies having higher Tm are preferable. Tm of a protein domain (e.g., a Fab domain) can be measured using any standard method known in the art, for example, by differential scanning calorimetry (see, e.g., Vermeer et al, 2000, Biophys. J. 78:394-404; Vermeer et al, 2000, Biophys. J. 79: 2150-2154). \n\n [0337] Accordingly, in certain embodiments the present disclosure includes anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure that have certain preferred biochemical characteristics such as a particular isoelectric point (pi) or melting temperature (Tm). \n\n\n [0338] More specifically, in one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a pi ranging from 5.5 to 9.5. In still another specific embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a pi that ranges from about 5.5 to about 6.0, or about 6.0 to about 6.5, or about 6.5 to about 7.0, or about 7.0 to about 7.5, or about 7.5 to about 8.0, or about 8.0 to about 8.5, or about 8.5 to about 9.0, or about 9.0 to about 9.5. In other specific embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a pi that ranges from 5.5- 6.0, or 6.0 to 6.5, or 6.5 to 7.0, or 7.0-7.5, or 7.5-8.0, or 8.0-8.5, or 8.5-9.0, or 9.0-9.5. Even more specifically, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a pi of at least 5.5, or at least 6.0, or at least 6.3, or at least 6.5, or at least 6.7, or at least 6.9, or at least 7.1, or at least 7.3, or at least 7.5, or at least 7.7, or at least 7.9, or at least 8.1, or at least 8.3, or at least 8.5, or at least 8.7, or at least 8.9, or at least 9.1, or at least 9.3, or at least 9.5. In other specific \n\n\nembodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a pi of at least about 5.5, or at least about 6.0, or at least about 6.3, or at least about 6.5, or at least about 6.7, or at least about 6.9, or at least about 7.1, or at least about 7.3, or at least about 7.5, or at least about 7.7, or at least about 7.9, or at least about 8.1, or at least about 8.3, or at least about 8.5, or at least about 8.7, or at least about 8.9, or at least about 9.1, or at least about 9.3, or at least about 9.5. \n\n\n[0339] It is possible to optimize solubility by altering the number and location of ionizable residues in the antibody to adjust the pi. For example the pi of a polypeptide can be manipulated by making the appropriate amino acid substitutions (e.g. , by substituting a charged amino acid such as a lysine, for an uncharged residue such as alanine). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, amino acid substitutions of an antibody that result in changes of the pi of said antibody may improve solubility and/or the stability of the antibody. One skilled in the art would understand which amino acid substitutions would be most appropriate for a particular antibody to achieve a desired pi. In one embodiment, a substitution is generated in an antibody of the disclosure to alter the pi. It is specifically contemplated that the substitution(s) of the Fc region that result in altered binding to FcyR (described supra) may also result in a change in the pi. In another embodiment, substitution(s) of the Fc region are specifically chosen to effect both the desired alteration in FcyR binding and any desired change in pi. \n\n [0340] In one embodiment, the ant-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a Tm ranging from 65°C to 120°C. In specific embodiments, the ant-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a Tm ranging from about 75°C to about 120°C, or about 75°C to about 85°C, or about 85°C to about 95°C, or about 95°C to about 105°C, or about 105°C to about 115°C, or about 115°C to about 120°C. In other specific embodiments, the ant-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a Tm ranging from 75°C to 120°C, or 75°C to 85°C, or 85°C to 95°C, or 95°C to 105°C, or 105°C to 115°C, or 115°C to 120°C. In still other specific embodiments, the ant-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a Tm of at least about 65°C, or at least about 70°C, or at least about 75°C, or at least about 80°C, or at least about 85°C, or at least about 90°C, or at least about 95°C, or at least about 100°C, or at least about 105°C, or at least about 110°C, or at least about 115°C, or at least about 120°C. In yet other specific embodiments, the ant-PAI-1 antibodies of the present disclosure have a Tm of at least 65°C, or at least 70°C, or at least 75°C, or at least 80°C, or at least 85°C, or at least 90°C, or at least 95°C, or at least 100°C, or at least 105°C, or at least 110°C, or at least 115°C, or at least 120°C. \n\n\n c) Binding Characteristics \n\n\n[0341] As described above, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure \n\n\nimmunospecifically bind at least one specified epitope or antigenic determinant of the PAI-1 protein, peptide, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof either exclusively or preferentially with respect to other polypeptides. The term \"epitope\" or \"antigenic determinant\" as used herein refers to a protein determinant capable of binding to an antibody, wherein the term \"binding\" herein preferably relates to a specific binding. These protein determinants or epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have a specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non-conformational epitopes are \n\n\ndistinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. The term \"discontinuous epitope\" as used herein, refers to a conformational epitope on a protein antigen which is formed from at least two separate regions in the primary sequence of the protein. \n\n\n [0342] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies immunospecifically bind to human PAI-1 and antigenic fragments thereof. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI antibodies specifically bind to reactive center loop of PAI-1. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 \n\n antibodies bind the same epitope as Antibody 8. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies bind the same epitope as an antibody comprising the six CDRs of Antibody 8. \n\n\n[0343] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure may bind epitopes conserved across species. In one embodiment, antibodies of the disclosure bind murine, non- human primate, rat, bovine, pig or other mammalian PAI-1 and antigenic fragments thereof. In one embodiment the antibodies of the disclosure may bind to one or more PAI-1 orthologs and or iso forms. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the disclosure bind to PAI-1 and antigenic fragments thereof from one or more species, including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, monkey, primate, and human. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure may bind an eptiope within humans across PAI-1 homo logs and/or isoforms and/or conformational variants and/or subtypes. \n\n\n [0344] The interactions between antigens and antibodies are the same as for other non- covalent protein-protein interactions. In general, four types of binding interactions exist between antigens and antibodies: (i) hydrogen bonds, (ii) dispersion forces, (iii) electrostatic forces between Lewis acids and Lewis bases, and (iv) hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic interactions are a major driving force for the antibody-antigen interaction, and are based on repulsion of water by non-polar groups rather than attraction of molecules (Tanford, 1978). However, certain physical forces also contribute to antigen-antibody binding, for example, the fit or complimentary of epitope shapes with different antibody binding sites. Moreover, other materials and antigens may cross-react with an antibody, thereby competing for available free antibody. \n\n\n [0345] Measurement of the affinity constant and specificity of binding between antigen and antibody is a pivotal element in determining the efficacy of therapeutic, diagnostic and research methods using the anti-PAI-1 antibodies. \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of the noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), which is calculated as the ratio k\n0ff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al, (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including \n\n those described and exemplified herein, such as BIACORE™. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present disclosure. \n\n\n[0346] The present anti-PAI -1 antibodies have binding affinities for a PAI-1 epitope that include a dissociation constant (K\nd\n) of less than lxlO\n~2\nM, lxlO\n~3\nM, lxlO\n~4\nM, lxlO\n~5\nM, lxlO\n~6\nM, lxlO\n~7\nM, lxlO\n~8\nM, 1\nχ\n10\n~9\nΜ, 1\nχ\n10\n~10\nΜ, lxlO\n~u\nM, 1\nχ\n10\n~12\nΜ, 1\nχ\n10\n~13\nΜ, lxlO\n~14\nM or less than 1x10\n15\nM. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies have a Kj of less than 10\n\"\n \n7\nM, less than 5xlO\n~8\nM, less than 10\n\"8\nM, less than 5xlO\n~9\nM, less than 10\n~9\nM, less than 5xlO\n~10\nM, less than 10\n\"10\nM, less than 5xlO\n~u\nM, less than 10\n\"U\nM, less than 5xlO\n~12\nM, less than 10\n~12\nM, less than 5xlO\n~13\nM, less than 10\n\"13\nM, less than 5xlO\n~14\nM, less than 10\n\"14\nM, less than 5xlO\n~15\nM, or less than 10\n\"15\n M. In certain embodiments, anti-PAI -1 antibodies have binding affinities for a PAI-1 epitope that include a dissociation constant (K\nd\n) of between lxlO\n~6\nM and lxlO\n~10\nM, lxlO\n~6\nM and lxlO\n~u\nM, lxlO\n~6\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~12\nΜ, lxlO\n~6\nM and lxlO\n~13\nM, lxlO\n~6\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~15\nΜ, lxlO\n~6\nM and lxlO\n~15\nM, lxlO\n~7\nM and lxlO\n~10\nM, lxlO\n~7\nM and lxlO\n~u\nM, lxlO\n~7\nM and lxlO\n~12\nM, lxlO\n_7\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~13\nΜ, lxlO\n~7\nM and lxlO\n~14\nM, lxlO\n~7\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~15\nΜ, lxlO\n~8\nM and lxlO\n_10\nM, lxlO\n~8\nM and lxlO\n~u\nM, lxlO\n~8\nM and lxlO\n~12\nM, lxlO\n~8\nM and lxlO\n~13\nM, lxlO\n~8\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~14\nΜ, lxlO\n~8\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~15\nΜ, lxlO\n~9\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~10\nΜ, lxlO\n~9\nM and lxlO\n~u\nM, lxlO\n_9\nM and lxlO\n~12\nM, lxlO\n~9\nM and 1\nχ\n10\n~13\nΜ, lxlO\n~9\nM and lxlO\n~14\nM and 1 x 10\n~9\nM and 1 x 10\n~15\nM. In certain embodiments, K\nd\n is measured by BIACORE™ affinity data. In certain embodiments, Kj is measured by cell binding. \n\n\n [0347] In certain embodiments, the anti- PAI -1 antibodies are high-affinity antibodies.\n\n\nBy \"high-affinity antibody\" is meant an antibody which binds to a PAI -1 epitope with an affinity less than 10\n~8\nM (e.g., 10\n~9\nM, 10\n~10\nM, etc.). \n\n\n [0348] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies have an affinity between 5 pM and 200 pM for active human PAI-1, as assessed by plasmon resonance. In certain \n\n\nembodiments, the affinity is approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 60, 70 ,75, 80, 90, 100, etc. pM. In certain embodiments, the affinity is between about 5 pM and 50 pM. In certain embodiments, the affinity is between about 5 pM and 100 pM. \n\n\n [0349] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies are described as having a binding affinity of a specific molarity or better. \"Or better\" when used herein refers to a stronger \n\n binding, represented by a smaller numerical Kd value. For example, an antibody which has an affinity for an antigen of \"0.6 nM or better\", the antibody's affinity for the antigen is <0.6 nM, i.e. 0.59 nM, 0.58 nM, 0.57 nM etc. or any value less than 0.6 nM. \n\n\n[0350] In an alternative embodiment, the affinity of the anti-PAI -1 antibodies is described in terms of the association constant (K\na\n), which is calculated as the ratio k\non\n/k\n0ff\n. In this instance the present anti-PAI- 1 antibodies have binding affinities for a PAI-1 epitope that include an association constant (K\na\n) of at least l x l0\n2\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n3\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n4\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n5\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n6\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n7\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n8\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n9\nM\n_1\n, 1 \nχ\n 10\n10\nΜ\n_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl x l0\n14\nM\n_1\n or at least l x l0\n15\nM\n_1\n. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies have a K\na\n of at least 10\n7\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n7\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n8\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n8\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n9\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n9\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n10\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n10\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n11\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n11\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n12\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n12\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n13\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n13\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n14\n M\n\"1\n, at least 5 X 10\n14\n M\n\"1\n, at least 10\n15\n M\n\"1\n, or at least 5 X 10\n15\n M\n\"1\n. In certain embodiments, anti-PAI- 1 antibodies have binding affinities for a PAI-1 epitope that include an association constant (K\na\n) of between l x l0\n2\nM\n_1\n and l x l0\n3\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n2\nM\n_1\n and l x l0\n4\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n2\nM\n_1\n and l x l0\n5\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n2\nM\n_1\n and l x l0\n6\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n3\nM\n_1\n and\n\n\n l x l0\n3\nM\n_1\n and l x l0\n5\nM\n_1\n, l x l0\n3\nM\n_1\n and \n\n\nl x l0\n4\nM\n_1\n and\n\n\n\n\n\n[0351] In certain embodiments the rate at which the anti-PAI- 1 antibodies dissociates from a PAI-1 epitope may be more relevant than the value of the K\nd\n or the K\na\n. In this instance the present anti-PAI- 1 antibodies bind to a PAI-1 with a k\n0ff\n of less than 10\n\"2\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"3\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"3\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"5\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"5\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"6\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"6\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"7\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"7\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"8\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5x10\n~8\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"9\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"9\n s\n\"1\n, or less than 10\n\"10\n s\n\"1\n. In certain other embodiments the rate at which the anti- PAI-1 antibodies associate with a PAI-1 epitope may be more relevant than the value of the IQ or the K\na\n. In this instance the present anti-PAI- 1 antibodies bind to a PAI-1 with a k\non\n rate of at least 10\n5\n M\n-1\ns\n-1\n, at least 5xl0\n5\n M\n-1\ns\n-1\n, at least 10\n6\n at least 5 x 10\n6\n M\n_1\ns\n_1\n, at least 10\n7\n M\n_1\ns\n_1\n, at least 5 x 10\n7\n M\n_1\ns\n_1\n, or at least 10\n8\n M\n_1\ns\n_1\n, or at least 10\n9\n M\n\"1\ns\n\"1\n. \n\n\n [0352] Determination of binding affinity can be measured using the specific techniques described further in the Example section, and methods well known in the art. One such method includes measuring the disassociation constant \"Kd\" by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay \n\n (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al, (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 μg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (H 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 μΐ/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; \n\n\nPackard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. \n\n\n [0353] In another instance the Kd value may be measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE™-2000 or a BIACORE™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 110 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (~0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, IM ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE™ Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. \n\n [0354] If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6\n1VT\n1\n S\n_1\n by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop- flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco \n\n\nspectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette. An \"on-rate\" or \"rate of association\" or \"association rate\" or \"k\non\n\" according to this disclosure can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIACORE™-2000 or a BIACORE™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) as described above. \n\n\n[0355] Methods and reagents suitable for determination of binding characteristics of an antibody of the present disclosure, or an altered/mutant derivative thereof (discussed below), are known in the art and/or are commercially available (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,849,425; 6,632,926; 6,294,391 ; 6, 143,574). Moreover, equipment and software designed for such kinetic analyses are commercially available (e.g. BIACORE® A100, and BIACORE ® 2000 instruments; Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). \n\n\n [0356] In one embodiment, a binding assay may be performed either as direct binding assays or as competition-binding assays. Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay, a candidate antibody is tested for binding to PAI-1 antigen. Competition-binding assay, on the other hand, assess the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti- PAI-1 antibody or other compound that binds PAI-1. In general any method that permits the binding of an antibody with a PAI-1 that can be detected is encompassed with the scope of the present disclosure for detecting and measuring the binding characteristics of the antibodies. One of skill in the art will recognize these well known methods and for this reason are not provided in detail here. These methods are also utilized to screen a panel of antibodies for those providing the desired characteristics. \n\n\n[0357] In certain embodiments an antibody of the disclosure immunospecifically binds to human PAI-1 and has one or more of the characteristics set forth in the examples vis-a-vis affinity, specificity, neutralization capacity (inhibition of PAI-1 bioactivty), epitope binding, etc. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the disclosure immunospecifically binds to human PAI-1 and has one or more of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n d) Functional Characteristics \n\n\n [0358] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure inhibit human\n\n\nPAI-1 activity, such as binding of human PAI-1 to tPA. This can be measured in cell based or cell free systems, as set forth in the example. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure neutralize a biological activity of PAI-1 , particularly human PAI-1. \n\n\n[0359] Neutralization assays are performed using methods known in the art using, some of which are described in the example. The neutralization of PAI-1 , such as human PAI-1 , is measured with an IC50 of 1 x 10\n\"6\n M or less, 1 x 10\n~7\n M or less, 1 x 10\n\"8\n M or less, 1 x 10\n~9\n M or less, 1 x 10\n\"10\n M or less and 1 x 10\n\"11\n M or less. In certain embodiments, the neutralization of PAI-1 is measured with an IC50 of between 1 x 10\n\"6\n M and 1 10\n~9\n M, 1 x 10\n\"6\n M and 1 x 10\n\"10\n M, 1 x 10\n\"6\n M and l x lO\n\"11\n M, l x lO\n\"7\n M and l x lO\n\"9\n M, l x lO\n\"7\n M and l x lO\n\"10\n M, l x lO\n\"7\n M and l x lO\n\"11\n M, l x lO\n\"8\n M and l x lO\n\"9\n M, l x lO\n\"8\n M and l x lO\n\"10\n M and l x lO\n\"8\n M and l x lO\n\"11\n M. In a further embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies neutralize at least one of (one or more of) chimpanzee PAI-1 , baboon PAI -1 , marmoset PAI -1 , cynomolgus PAI-1 , rhesus PAI-1 , rat PAI -1 , mouse PAI -1 , pig PAI -1 or other mammalian PAI -1. The term \"inhibitory concentration 50%\" (abbreviated as \"IC50\") represents the concentration of an inhibitor (e.g., an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure ) that is required for 50% inhibition of a given activity of the molecule the inhibitor targets (e.g., PAI-1). It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that a lower IC50 value corresponds to a more potent inhibitor. When anti-PAI-1 antibodies inhibit the activity of human PAI-1 and PAI-1 from one or more additional species, inhibit can be with about the same IC50 value or substantially equipotent IC50 value. \n\n\n [0360] In another embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are described as not inhibiting one or more biological activities of PAI-1 , such as binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin. The term \"inhibition\" as used herein, refers to any statistically significant decrease in biological activity, including full blocking of the activity. For example, \"inhibition\" can refer to a decrease of about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% in biological activity. In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies does not inhibit one or more biological activities of PAI-1 by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%. \n\n\n [0361] In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure exhibit a reduced antibody related toxicity as compared to an PAI-1 antibody that disrupt vitronectin binding. In another embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure exhibit toxicities that are at least \n\n 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or are between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, less than that of an antibody that disrupts PAI- 1 : vitronectin binding. In another embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure exhibit toxicities that are reduced by at least 10%, or at least 20%>, or by at least 30%>, or by at least 40%>, or by at least 50%>, or by at least 60%>, or by at least 70%>, or by at least 80%>, or by at least 90%>, or by at least 100%, or by at least 200%, or by at least 300%, or by at least 400%, or by at least 500% relative to an antibody that disrupts PAI-1 : vitronectin binding. \n\n\n [0362] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure are human, humanized, chimeric or antibody fragments. \n\n\n [0363] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure bind specifically to human PAI-1 and have one or more (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, more than 10) of the Desired Characteristics. \n\n\n [0364] Such antibodies may have additional characteristics, including additional characteristics described in the examples. \n\n\n [0365] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure may bind epitopes conserved across species. In one embodiment, antibodies of the disclosure bind murine, non- human primate, rat, bovine, pig or other mammalian PAI-1 and antigenic fragments thereof. In one embodiment the antibodies of the disclosure may bind to one or more PAI-1 orthologs and or iso forms. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the disclosure bind to PAI-1 and antigenic fragments thereof from one or more species, including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, monkey, primate, and human. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure may bind an eptiope within humans across PAI-1 homo logs and/or isoforms and/or conformational variants and/or subtypes. \n\n\n [0366] Exemplary anti-PAI-1 antibodies are provided herein (See Examples and Tables\n\n\n2, 16, and Sequence Listing). Functional characteristics of these exemplary antibodies are provided in the examples. It is contemplated that antibodies of the disclosure can be described using any one or more of the sequence (structural) and functional characteristics described herein, including features described in the examples and tables. \n\n D. Production of Anti-PAI-1 Antibodies \n\n\n [0367] The following describes exemplary techniques for the production of the antibodies useful in the present disclosure. Such techniques are merely exemplary. It should be understood that these techniques can be used in the production of antibodies and antibody fragments, where applicable. Throughout this section, reference to antibodies is intended to refer to both antibodies and, where applicable, antibody fragments. Moreover, the disclosure contemplates anti-PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments having any of the features (e.g., tagged, human, etc.) described in this section, as well as the use of such antibodies. Some of these techniques are described further in the Example section. \n\n\n [0368] The PAI-1 antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be human PAI-1 or an antigenic fragment thereof. In particular embodiments, the antigenic fragment of human PAI-1 is a fragment that includes the reactive center loop that normally interacts with tPA/uPA. Human PAI-1 and PAI-1 fragments can be produced recombinantly in an isolated form from, bacterial or eukaryotic cells using standard recombinant DNA methodology. PAI-1 can be expressed as a tagged (e.g., epitope tag) or other fusion protein to facilitate isolation as well as identification in various assays. Antibodies or binding proteins that bind to various tags and fusion sequences are available as elaborated below. Other forms of PAI-1 useful for generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n 1. Tags \n\n\n [0369] Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art.\n\n\nExamples include poly-histidine (poly-his) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-his-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field et al, Mol. Cell. Biol, 8:2159-2165 (1988)]; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto [Evan et al, \n\n\nMolecular and Cellular Biology, 5:3610-3616 (1985)]; and the Herpes Simplex virus \n\n\nglycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody [Paborsky et al, Protein Engineering, 3(6):547-553 (1990)]. The FLAG-peptide [Hopp et al, BioTechnology, 6:1204-1210 (1988)] is recognized by an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, Conn.). Purification of a protein containing the FLAG peptide can be performed by immunoaffinity chromatography using an affinity matrix comprising the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody covalently attached to agarose (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, Conn.). Other tag polypeptides include the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al, Science, 255: 192-194 (1992)]; an a-tubulin epitope peptide \n\n [Skinner et al, J. Biol. Chem., 266:15163-15166 (1991)]; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag [Lutz-Freyermuth et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6393-6397 (1990)]. \n\n\n 2. Monoclonal Antibodies \n\n\n [0370] Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma (Kohler et al, Nature, 256:495 (1975); Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); \n\n\nHammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981), recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. The term \n\n\n\"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous or isolated antibodies, e.g., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site or multiple antigenic sites in the case of multispecific engineered antibodies. \n\n\nFurthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against the same determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \"monoclonal\" is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. Following is a description of representative methods for producing monoclonal antibodies which is not intended to be limiting and may be used to produce, for example, monoclonal mammalian, chimeric, humanized, human, domain, diabodies, vaccibodies, linear and multispecific antibodies. \n\n\n 3. Hybridoma Techniques \n\n\n [0371] Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In the hybridoma method, mice or other appropriate host animals, such as hamster, are immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the antigen used for \n\n\nimmunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro, as is typically done when using hybridoma technology to produce human monoclonal antibodies.. After immunization (in vivo or in vitro), lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent or fusion partner, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell \n\n (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59- 103 (Academic Press, 1986)). In certain embodiments, the selected myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. In one aspect, the myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. \n\n\nImmunol, 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)). \n\n\n [0372] Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g, by i.p. injection of the cells into mice. \n\n\n[0373] The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, affinity tags, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel \n\n\nelectrophoresis, dialysis, etc. Exemplary purification methods are described in more detail below. \n\n\n 4. Recombinant DNA Techniques \n\n\n [0374] Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using recombinant\n\n\nDNA technology are routine and well known in the art (e.g. US Patent No. 4,816,567). DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies may be readily isolated and/or sequenced using \n\n\nconventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the \n\n recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al, Curr. Opinion in Immunol, 5:256-262 (1993) and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs., 130: 151-188 (1992). As described below for antibodies generated by phage display and humanization of antibodies, DNA or genetic material for recombinant antibodies can be obtained from source(s) other than hybridomas to generate antibodies of the disclosure. \n\n\n[0375] Recombinant expression of an antibody or variant thereof generally requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. The disclosure, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a portion thereof, or a heavy or light chain CDR, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., US. Patent Nos. 5,981,216; 5,591,639; 5,658,759 and 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy, the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains. \n\n\n[0376] Once the expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques, the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody. Thus, the disclosure includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the disclosure or fragments thereof, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or portion thereof, or a single-chain antibody of the disclosure, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In certain embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below. \n\n\n [0377] Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression of recombinant antibodies are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post- translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the antibody or portion thereof expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular \n\n machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, NSO (a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any functional \n\n\nimmunoglobulin chains), SP20, CRL7030 and HsS78Bst cells. In one embodiment, human cell lines developed by immortalizing human lymphocytes can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal antibodies. In one embodiment, the human cell line PER.C6. (Crucell, Netherlands) can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal antibodies. \n\n\n [0378] Additional cell lines which may be used as hosts for expression of recombinant antibodies include, but are not limited to, insect cells (e.g. Sf21/Sf9, Trichoplusia ni Bti-Tn5bl- 4) or yeast cells (e.g. S. cerevisiae, Pichia, US7326681; etc), plants cells (US20080066200); and chicken cells (WO2008142124). \n\n\n [0379] In certain embodiments, antibodies of the disclosure are expressed in a cell line with stable expression of the antibody. Stable expression can be used for long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be generated. Host cells can be transformed with an appropriately engineered vector comprising expression control elements {e.g. , promoter, enhancer, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker gene. Following the \n\n\nintroduction of the foreign DNA, cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells that stably integrated the plasmid into their chromosomes to grow and form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. Methods for producing stable cell lines with a high yield are well known in the art and reagents are generally available commercially. \n\n\n [0380] In certain embodiments, antibodies of the disclosure are expressed in a cell line with transient expression of the antibody. Transient transfection is a process in which the nucleic acid introduced into a cell does not integrate into the genome or chromosomal DNA of that cell. It is in fact maintained as an extrachromosomal element, e.g. as an episome, in the cell. \n\n\nTranscription processes of the nucleic acid of the episome are not affected and a protein encoded by the nucleic acid of the episome is produced. \n\n [0381] The cell line, either stable or transiently transfected, is maintained in cell culture medium and conditions well known in the art resulting in the expression and production of monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, the mammalian cell culture media is based on commercially available media formulations, including, for example, DMEM or Ham's F12. In other embodiments, the cell culture media is modified to support increases in both cell growth and biologic protein expression. As used herein, the terms \"cell culture medium,\" \"culture medium,\" and \"medium formulation\" refer to a nutritive solution for the maintenance, growth, propagation, or expansion of cells in an artificial in vitro environment outside of a multicellular organism or tissue. Cell culture medium may be optimized for a specific cell culture use, including, for example, cell culture growth medium which is formulated to promote cellular growth, or cell culture production medium which is formulated to promote recombinant protein production. The terms nutrient, ingredient, and component are used interchangeably herein to refer to the constituents that make up a cell culture medium. \n\n\n [0382] In one embodiment, the cell lines are maintained using a fed batch method. As used herein, \"fed batch method,\" refers to a method by which a fed batch cell culture is supplied with additional nutrients after first being incubated with a basal medium. For example, a fed batch method may comprise adding supplemental media according to a determined feeding schedule within a given time period. Thus, a \"fed batch cell culture\" refers to a cell culture wherein the cells, typically mammalian, and culture medium are supplied to the culturing vessel initially and additional culture nutrients are fed, continuously or in discrete increments, to the culture during culturing, with or without periodic cell and/or product harvest before termination of culture. \n\n\n [0383] The cell culture medium used and the nutrients contained therein are known to one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the cell culture medium comprises a basal medium and at least one hydro lysate, e.g., soy-based, hydro lysate, a yeast-based hydro lysate, or a combination of the two types of hydro lysates resulting in a modified basal medium. In another embodiment, the additional nutrients may include only a basal medium, such as a concentrated basal medium, or may include only hydro lysates, or concentrated hydro lysates. Suitable basal media include, but are not limited to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), DME/F12, Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), Basal Medium Eagle (BME), RPMI 1640, F-10, F-12, a- Minimal Essential Medium (a-MEM), Glasgow's Minimal Essential Medium (G-MEM), PF \n\n CHO (see, e.g., CHO protein free medium (Sigma) or EX-CELL™ 325 PF CHO Serum-Free Medium for CHO Cells Protein-Free (SAFC Bioscience), and Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium. Other examples of basal media which may be used in the disclosure include BME Basal Medium (Gibco-Invitrogen; see also Eagle, H (1965) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 89, 36); Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, powder) (Gibco-Invitrogen (# 31600); see also Dulbecco and Freeman (1959) Virology 8, 396; Smith et al. (1960) Virology 12, 185. Tissue Culture Standards Committee, In vitro 6:2, 93); CMRL 1066 Medium (Gibco-Invitrogen (#11530); see also Parker R. C. et al (1957) Special Publications, N.Y. Academy of Sciences, 5, 303). \n\n\n [0384] In certain embodiments, the basal medium may be is serum- free, meaning that the medium contains no serum (e.g., fetal bovine serum (FBS), horse serum, goat serum, or any other animal-derived serum known to one skilled in the art) or animal protein free media or chemically defined media. \n\n\n [0385] The basal medium may be modified in order to remove certain non-nutritional components found in standard basal medium, such as various inorganic and organic buffers, surfactant(s), and sodium chloride. Removing such components from basal cell medium allows an increased concentration of the remaining nutritional components, and may improve overall cell growth and protein expression. In addition, omitted components may be added back into the cell culture medium containing the modified basal cell medium according to the requirements of the cell culture conditions. In certain embodiments, the cell culture medium contains a modified basal cell medium, and at least one of the following nutrients, an iron source, a recombinant growth factor; a buffer; a surfactant; an osmolality regulator; an energy source; and non-animal hydrolysates. In addition, the modified basal cell medium may optionally contain amino acids, vitamins, or a combination of both amino acids and vitamins. In another embodiment, the modified basal medium further contains glutamine, e.g, L-glutamine, and/or methotrexate. \n\n\n[0386] In certain embodiments, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a bioreactor process using fed-batch, batch, perfusion or continuous feed bioreactor methods known in the art. Large-scale bioreactors have at least 1000 liters of capacity, preferably about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These bioreactors may use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients. Small scale bioreactors refers generally to cell culturing in no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 \n\n liters. Alternatively, single-use bioreactors (SUB) may be used for either large-scale or small scale culturing. \n\n\n [0387] Temperature, pH, agitation, aeration and inoculum density will vary depending upon the host cells used and the recombinant protein to be expressed. For example, a \n\n\nrecombinant protein cell culture may be maintained at a temperature between 30 and 45 degrees Celsius. The pH of the culture medium may be monitored during the culture process such that the pH stays at an optimum level, which may be for certain host cells, within a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0. An impellor driven mixing may be used for such culture methods for agitation. The rotational speed of the impellor may be approximately 50 to 200 cm/sec tip speed, but other airlift or other mixing/aeration systems known in the art may be used, depending on the type of host cell being cultured. Sufficient aeration is provided to maintain a dissolved oxygen concentration of approximately 20% to 80% air saturation in the culture, again, depending upon the selected host cell being cultured. Alternatively, a bioreactor may sparge air or oxygen directly into the culture medium. Other methods of oxygen supply exist, including bubble-free aeration systems employing hollow fiber membrane aerators. \n\n\n 5. Phage Display Techniques \n\n\n[0388] In another embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al, Nature, 348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al, Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al, J. Mol Biol, 222:581-597 (1991). In such methods antibodies of the disclosure can be isolated by screening of a recombinant combinatorial antibody library, preferably a scFv phage display library, prepared using human VL and VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived from human lymphocytes. Methodologies for preparing and screening such libraries are known in the art. In addition to commercially available kits for generating phage display libraries (e.g., the \n\n\nPharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, catalog no. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene SURFZAP™ phage display kit, catalog no. 240612), examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display libraries can be found in, for example, US Patent Nos. 6,248,516; US 6,545,142; 6,291,158; 6,291,1591; 6,291,160; 6,291,161; 6,680,192; 5,969,108; 6,172,197; 6,806,079; 5,885,793; 6,521,404; 6,544,731; \n\n\n6,555,313; 6,593,081; 6,582,915; 7,195,866. Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to \n\n traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for generation and isolation of monoclonal antibodies. \n\n\n [0389] In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. \n\n\nPhage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and Ml 3 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. \n\n\n [0390] As described in the above references, after phage selection, the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies, including human antibodies, humanized antibodies, or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described in detail below. For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92/22324; Mullinax et al, BioTechniques 12(6):864-869 (1992);; and Better et al, Science 240: 1041-1043 (1988). \n\n\n [0391] Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498. Thus, techniques described above and those well known in the art can be used to generate recombinant antibodies wherein the binding domain, e.g. ScFv, was isolated from a phage display library. \n\n\n 6. Antibody Purification and Isolation \n\n\n[0392] Once an antibody molecule has been produced by recombinant or hybridoma expression, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an \n\n\nimmunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigens Protein A or Protein G, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies of the present disclosure or fragments thereof \n\n may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences (referred to herein as \"tags\") described above or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification. \n\n\n [0393] When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., Bio/Technology, 10: 163- 167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants. \n\n\n[0394] The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and/or affinity chromatography either alone or in combination with other purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody and will be understood by one of skill in the art. The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH\n3\n domain, the Bakerbond ABX resin (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin, SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered. \n\n\n [0395] Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, and performed at low salt concentrations {e.g., from about 0-0.25 M salt). \n\n [0396] Thus, in certain embodiments is provided antibodies of the disclosure that are substantially purified/isolated. In one embodiment, these isolated/purified recombinantly expressed antibodies may be administered to a patient to mediate a prophylactic or therapeutic effect. In another embodiment these isolated/purified antibodies may be used to diagnose a PAI- 1 mediated disease. \n\n\n 7. Humanized and Chimeric Antibodies \n\n\n[0397] In certain embodiments, the antibodies and antibody fragments of the disclosure, including monoclonal antibodies, are humanized antibodies, which are generated using methods well known in the art. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules derived from a non-human species antibody (also referred to herein as a donor antibody) that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule (also referred to herein as an acceptor antibody). Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding and/or reduce immunogenicity. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g,, Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988)). In practice, and in certain embodiments, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. In alternative embodiments, the FR residues are fully human residues. \n\n\n [0398] Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al, Nature, 321 :522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al, Supra; Verhoeyen et al, Science, 239: 1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Specifically, humanized antibodies may be prepared by methods well known in the art including CDR grafting approaches (see, e.g., US Patent No. 6,548,640), veneering or resurfacing (US Patent Nos. 5,639,641 and 6,797,492; \n\n\nStudnicka et al, Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska. et al, PNAS 91 :969-973 (1994)), chain shuffling strategies (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332; Rader et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1998) 95:8910-8915), molecular modeling strategies (U.S. Patent No. \n\n 5,639,641), and the like. These general approaches may be combined with standard mutagenesis and recombinant synthesis techniques to produce anti-PAI-1 antibodies with desired properties. \n\n\n[0399] CDR grafting is performed by replacing one or more CDRs of an acceptor antibody (e.g., a human antibody) with one or more CDRs of a donor antibody (e.g., a non- human antibody). Acceptor antibodies may be selected based on similarity of framework residues between a candidate acceptor antibody and a donor antibody and may be further modified to introduce similar residues. Following CDR grafting, additional changes may be made in the donor and/or acceptor sequences to optimize antibody binding and functionality. \n\n\n[0400] Grafting of abbreviated CDR regions is a related approach. Abbreviated CDR regions include the specificity-determining residues and adjacent amino acids, including those at positions 27d-34, 50-55 and 89-96 in the light chain, and at positions 31-35b, 50-58, and 95-101 in the heavy chain. See (Padlan et al. (1995) FASEB J. 9: 133-9). Grafting of specificity- determining residues (SDRs) is premised on the understanding that the binding specificity and affinity of an antibody combining site is determined by the most highly variable residues within each of the CDR regions. Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of antibody-antigen complexes, combined with analysis of the available amino acid sequence data was used to model sequence variability based on structural dissimilarity of amino acid residues that occur at each position within the CDR. Minimally immunogenic polypeptide sequences consisting of contact residues, which are referred to as SDRs, are identified and grafted onto human framework regions. \n\n\n [0401] Veneering or resurfacing is based on the concept of reducing potentially immunogenic amino acid sequences in a rodent or other non-human antibody by resurfacing the solvent accessible exterior of the antibody with human amino acid sequences. Thus, veneered antibodies appear less foreign to human cells. A non-human antibody is veneered by (1) identifying exposed exterior framework region residues in the non-human antibody, which are different from those at the same positions in framework regions of a human antibody, and (2) replacing the identified residues with amino acids that typically occupy these same positions in human antibodies. \n\n\n [0402] By definition, humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies. Chimeric antibodies are antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a \n\n particular antibody class or subclass, while another portion of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g., Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n\n\n81 :6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \"primatized\" antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a nonhuman primate {e.g. , Old World Monkey, such as baboon, rhesus or cynomolgus monkey) and human constant region sequences (U.S. Patent No. 5,693,780). \n\n\n 8. Human Antibodies \n\n\n[0403] As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated using methods well known in the art. Thus, in certain embodiments, the antibodies and antibody fragments, including monoclonal antibodies, are human antibodies. Human antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies. \n\n\n [0404] For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the \n\n\nhomozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (½) gene in chimeric and germ- line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al, Nature, 362:255-258 (1993); \n\n\nBruggemann et al, Year in Immuno., 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806, 5,569,825, \n\n\n5,591,669 (all of GenPharm); U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807; and WO 97/17852. In practice, the use of XENOMOUSE® strains of mice that have been engineered to contain up to but less than 1000 kb-sized germline configured fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain \n\n locus. See Mendez et al. Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 (1997) and Green and Jakobovits J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495 (1998). The XENOMOUSE® strains are available from Amgen, Inc. \n\n\n(Fremont, Calif.). \n\n\n [0405] The production of the XENOMOUSE® strains of mice and antibodies produced in those mice is further discussed and delineated in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,673,986; 7,049,426; \n\n\n6,833,268; 6,162,963, 6,150,584, 6,114,598, 6,075,181, 6,657,103; 6,713,610 and 5,939,598; US Publication Nos. 2004/0010810; 2003/0229905; 2004/0093622; 2005/0054055; 2005/0076395; and 2006/0040363. \n\n\n [0406] Essentially, XENOMOUSE® lines of mice are immunized with an antigen of interest (e.g. PAI-1), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines using techniques described above an well known in the art. These hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. \n\n\n [0407] In an alternative approach, others, including GenPharm International, Inc., have utilized a \"minilocus\" approach. In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more V\nH\n genes, one or more D\nH\n genes, one or more JH genes, a mu constant region, and usually a second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,625,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016; 5,770,429; 5,789,650; 5,814,318; 5,877,397; 5,874,299; 6,255,458; \n\n\n5,591,669; 6,023,010; 5,612,205; 5,721,367; 5,789,215; 5,643,763; and 5,981,175. \n\n\n[0408] Kirin has also demonstrated the generation of human antibodies from mice in which, through microcell fusion, large pieces of chromosomes, or entire chromosomes, have been introduced. See Patent No. 6,632,976. Additionally, KM™— mice, which are the result of cross-breeding of Kirin' s Tc mice with Medarex's minilocus (Humab) mice have been generated. These mice possess the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al., Cloning Stem Cells, (2002) 4:91-102). \n\n\n[0409] Human antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods. Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display (Medlmmune (formerly CAT), Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Symphogen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome display \n\n (Medlmmune (formerly CAT)), yeast display, and the like. The phage display technology (See e.g., US Patent No. 5,969,108) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as Ml 3 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al, Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from \n\n\nunimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al, EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905. \n\n\n [0410] As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated\n\n\nB cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275). \n\n\n [0411] Immunoglobulin genes undergo various modifications during maturation of the immune response, including recombination between V, D and J gene segments, isotype switching, and hypermutation in the variable regions. Recombination and somatic \n\n\nhypermutation are the foundation for generation of antibody diversity and affinity maturation, but they can also generate sequence liabilities that may make commercial production of such immunoglobulins as therapeutic agents difficult or increase the immunogenicity risk of the antibody. In general, mutations in CDR regions are likely to contribute to improved affinity and function, while mutations in framework regions may increase the risk of immunogenicity. This risk can be reduced by reverting framework mutations to germline while ensuring that activity of the antibody is not adversely impacted. The diversification processes may also generate some structural liabilities or these structural liabilities may exist within germline sequences \n\n contributing to the heavy and light chain variable domains. Regardless of the source, it may be desirable to remove potential structural liabilities that may result in instability, aggregation, heterogeneity of product, or increased immunogenicity. Examples of undesirable liabilities include unpaired cysteines (which may lead to disulfide bond scrambling, or variable sulfliydryl adduct formation), N-linked glycosylation sites (resulting in heterogeneity of structure and activity), as well as deamidation (e.g. NG, NS), isomerization (DG), oxidation (exposed methionine), and hydrolysis (DP) sites. \n\n\n [0412] Accordingly, in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity and improve pharmaceutical properties of the antibodies of the disclosure, it may be desirable to revert a framework sequence to germline, revert a CDR to germline, and/or remove a structural liability. \n\n\n 9. Antibody Fragments \n\n\n[0413] In certain embodiments, the present antibodies are antibody fragments or antibodies comprising these fragments. The antibody fragment comprises a portion of the full length antibody, which generally is the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, Fd and Fv fragments. Diabodies; linear antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies are antibodies formed from these antibody fragments. \n\n\n [0414] Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies using techniques well known in the art. However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. In one embodiment, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can also be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (Carter et ah, Bio/Technology, 10: 163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single-chain Fv fragment (scFv). In certain embodiments, the antibody is not a Fab fragment. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins \n\n may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. \n\n\n [0415] In certain embodiments, the present antibodies are domain antibodies, e.g., antibodies containing the small functional binding units of antibodies, corresponding to the variable regions of the heavy (V\nH\n) or light (V\nL\n) chains of human antibodies. Examples of domain antibodies include, but are not limited to, those available from Domantis that are specific to therapeutic targets (see, for example, WO04/058821 ; WO04/081026; WO04/003019; \n\n\nWO03/002609; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,291,158; 6,582,915; 6,696,245; and 6,593,081). \n\n\n[0416] In certain embodiments of the disclosure, the present antibodies are linear antibodies. Linear antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nHI\n-V\nH\n-C\nHI\n) which form a pair of antigen-binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific. See, Zapata et al, Protein Eng., 8(10): 1057-1062 (1995). \n\n\n 10. Bispecific Antibodies \n\n\n[0417] Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the PAI-1 protein. Other such antibodies may combine a PAI-1 binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively, an anti-PAI-1 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (FcyR), such as FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIII (CD 16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the PAI-1 -expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express PAI-1. These antibodies possess a PAI-1 -binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g. \n\n\nsaporin, anti-interferon-a, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab')\n2\n bispecific antibodies). Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. (See, for example, Millstein et al, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983); Traunecker et al, EMBO J, 10:3655-3659 (1991); Suresh et al, Methods in Enzymology , 121 :210 (1986); Kostelny et al., J. Immunol, 148(5): 1547-1553 (1992); Hollinger et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993); Gruber et al, J. Immunol, 152:5368 (1994); U.S. Patent Nos. 4,474,893; 4,714,681; 4,925,648; 5,573,920; 5,601,819; 5,731,168; 4,676,980; 5,897,861; 5,660,827; 5,811,267; \n\n 5,849,877; 5,948,647; 5,959,084; 6,106,833; 6,143,873 and 4,676,980, WO 94/04690; and WO 92/20373.) \n\n\n [0418] Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co- expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al, EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991). \n\n\n[0419] According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C\nH\n2, and C\nH\n3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C\nH\nI) containing the site necessary for light chain bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination. \n\n\n [0420] In one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure may facilitate the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way \n\n of separation. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al, Methods in Enzymology, 121 :210 (1986). \n\n\n [0421] According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C\nH\n3 domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \"cavities\" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers. \n\n\n[0422] Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \"heteroconjugate\" antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (US Patent No. 5,897,861). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques. \n\n\n [0423] Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab')\n2\n fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent, sodium arsenite, to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes. \n\n\n [0424] Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from E. coli, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al, J. Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')\n2\n \n\n molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. \n\n\n[0425] Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al, J. Immunol, 148(5): 1547- 1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \"diabody\" technology described by Hollinger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a V\nH\n connected to a V\nL\nby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al, J. Immunol, 152:5368 (1994) and US Patent Nos. 5,591,828; 4,946,778; 5,455,030; and 5,869,620. \n\n\n[0426] Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared, Tutt et al. J. Immunol 147: 60 (1991), and multispecific valencies US Patent No. 5,258,498. \n\n\n 11. Other Amino Acid Sequence Modifications \n\n\n[0427] In addition to the above described human, humanized and/or chimeric antibodies, the present disclosure also encompasses further modifications and, their variants and fragments thereof, of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure comprising one or more amino acid residues and/or polypeptide substitutions, additions and/or deletions in the variable light (V\nL\n) domain and/or variable heavy (V\nH\n) domain and/or Fc region and post translational modifications. Included in these modifications are antibody conjugates wherein an antibody has been covalently attached to a moiety. Moieties suitable for attachment to the antibodies include but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, drugs, labels, and cytotoxins. These changes to the antibodies may \n\n be made to alter or fine tune the characteristics (biochemical, binding and/or functional) of the antibodies as is appropriate for treatment and/or diagnosis of PAI-1 mediated diseases. Methods for forming conjugates, making amino acid and/or polypeptide changes and post-translational modifications are well known in the art, some of which are detailed below. The following description is not intended to be limiting, but instead a non-limiting description of some embodiments, more of which will be obvious to one of skill in the art. It is also understood that some of the following methods were used to develop the human, humanized and/or chimeric antibody sequences described above. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. \n\n\n [0428] Amino acid changes to the antibodies necessarily results in sequences that are less than 100% identical to the above identified antibody sequences. In certain embodiments, in this context, the antibodies many have about 25% to about 95% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of an anti-PAI-1 antibody as described herein. Thus, in one embodiment a modified antibody may have an amino acid sequence having at least 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of an anti-PAI-1 antibody as described herein. In another embodiment, an altered antibody may have an amino acid sequence having at least 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75%), 80%), 85%), 90%), or 95% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of the heavy or light chain CDR1 , CDR2, or CDR3 of an anti-PAI-1 antibody as described herein. In another embodiment, an altered antibody may have an amino acid sequence having at least 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of the heavy or light chain FRl , FR2, FR3 or FR4 of an anti-PAI-1 antibody as described herein. \n\n\n [0429] In certain embodiments, altered antibodies are generated by one or more amino acid alterations (e.g., substitutions, deletion and/or additions) introduced in one or more of the variable regions of the antibody. In another embodiment, the amino acid alterations are introduced in the framework regions. One or more alterations of framework region residues may result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen. This may be especially true when these changes are made to humanized antibodies wherein the framework \n\n region may be from a different species than the CDR regions. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al, Science, 233:747-753 (1986)); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol, 196:901-917 (1987)); and/or participate in the V\nL\n-V\nH\n interface (US Patent Nos. 5,225,539 and 6,548,640). In one embodiment, from about one to about five framework residues may be altered. Sometimes, this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials, even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. \n\n\nNormally, however, an altered antibody will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration(s). In certain embodiments, the hypervariable region residues may be changed randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of an anti-PAI-1 antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species is such that such randomly produced antibodies can be readily screened. \n\n\n [0430] One useful procedure for generating altered antibodies is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis\" (Cunningham and Wells, Science, 244: 1081-1085 (1989)). In this method, one or more of the hypervariable region residue(s) are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue(s) to alter the interaction of the amino acids with the PAI-1. Those hypervariable region residue(s) demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing additional or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The Ala-mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein. \n\n\n [0431] In certain embodiments the substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A \n\n\nconvenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display (Hawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol, 254:889-896 (1992) and Lowman et al, \n\n\nBiochemistry, 30(45): 10832-10837 (1991)). Briefly, several hypervariable region sites {e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles \n\n as fusions to the gene III product of Ml 3 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. , binding affinity) as herein disclosed. \n\n\n[0432] Mutations in antibody sequences may include substitutions, deletions, including internal deletions, additions, including additions yielding fusion proteins, or conservative substitutions of amino acid residues within and/or adjacent to the amino acid sequence, but that result in a \"silent\" change, in that the change produces a functionally equivalent anti-PAI-1 antibody. Conservative amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example, non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In addition, glycine and proline are residues that can influence chain orientation. Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another class. Furthermore, if desired, non-classical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the antibody sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, the D-isomers of the common amino acids, a -amino isobutyric acid, 4- aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, γ-Abu, ε-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2- amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, \n\n\ncyclohexylalanine, β-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as β-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. \n\n\n[0433] In another embodiment, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the anti-PAI-1 antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). \n\n\n [0434] In certain embodiments of the disclosure, an antibody can be modified to produce fusion proteins; i.e., the antibody, or a fragment thereof, fused to a heterologous protein, polypeptide or peptide. In certain embodiments, the protein fused to the portion of an antibody is \n\n an enzyme component of Antibody-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). Examples of other proteins or polypeptides that can be engineered as a fusion protein with an antibody include, but are not limited to toxins such as ricin, abrin, ribonuclease, DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed anti-viral protein, gelonin, diphtherin toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin, and Pseudomonas endotoxin. See, for example, Pastan et ah, Cell, 47:641 (1986), and \n\n\nGoldenberg et ah, Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 44:43 (1994). Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, non-binding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the \n\n\ntricothecenes. See, for example, WO 93/21232. \n\n\n [0435] Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene- shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \"DNA shuffling\"). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the characteristics of the antibody or fragments thereof (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et ah, 1997, Curr. Opinion Biotechnol, 8:724-33 ; Harayama, 1998, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76-82; Hansson et ah, 1999, J. Mol. Biol, 287:265-76; and Lorenzo and Blasco, 1998, Biotechniques 24(2):308- 313. The antibody can further be a binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as described in U.S. Publication 2003/0118592, and PCT \n\n\nPublication WO 02/056910. \n\n\n 12. Variant Fc Regions \n\n\n[0436] It is known that variants of the Fc region (e.g., amino acid substitutions and/or additions and/or deletions) enhance or diminish effector function of the antibody (See e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821; 5,885,573; 6,538,124; 7,317,091; 5,648,260; 6,538,124; WO 03/074679; WO 04/029207; WO 04/099249; WO 99/58572; US Publication No. 2006/0134105; \n\n\n2004/0132101; 2006/0008883) and may alter the pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. half-life) of the antibody (see, U.S. patents 6,277,375 and 7,083,784). Thus, in certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure comprise an altered Fc region (also referred to herein as \"variant Fc region\") in which one or more alterations have been made in the Fc region in order to \n\n change functional and/or pharmacokinetic properties of the antibodies. Such alterations may result in a decrease or increase of Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or of FcyR binding, for IgG, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). The present disclosure encompasses the antibodies described herein with variant Fc regions wherein changes have been made to fine tune the effector function, enhancing or diminishing, providing a desired effector function. \n\n\nAccordingly, in one embodiment of the disclosure, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure comprise a variant Fc region (i.e., Fc regions that have been altered as discussed below). Anti- PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure comprising a variant Fc region are also referred to here as \"Fc variant antibodies.\" As used herein native refers to the unmodified parental sequence and the antibody comprising a native Fc region is herein referred to as a \"native Fc antibody\". Fc variant antibodies can be generated by numerous methods well known to one skilled in the art. Non- limiting examples include, isolating antibody coding regions (e.g., from hybridoma) and making one or more desired substitutions in the Fc region of the isolated antibody coding region. \n\n\nAlternatively, the antigen-binding portion (e.g., variable regions) of an anti-PAI -1 antibody may be subcloned into a vector encoding a variant Fc region. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region exhibits a similar level of inducing effector function as compared to the native Fc region. In another embodiment, the variant Fc region exhibits a higher induction of effector function as compared to the native Fc. In another embodiment, the variant Fc region exhibits lower induction of effector function as compared to the native Fc. Some specific embodiments of variant Fc regions are detailed infra. Methods for measuring effector function are well known in the art. \n\n\n [0437] The effector function of an antibody is modified through changes in the Fc region, including but not limited to, amino acid substitutions, amino acid additions, amino acid deletions and changes in post translational modifications to Fc amino acids (e.g. glycosylation). The methods described below may be used to fine tune the effector function of a present antibody, a ratio of the binding properties of the Fc region for the FcR (e.g., affinity and specificity), resulting in a therapeutic antibody with the desired properties for a particular disease indication and taking into consideration the biology of PAI-1. \n\n\n [0438] It is understood that the Fc region as used herein includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region \n\n immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cy2 and Cy3) and the hinge between Cgammal (Cyl) and Cgamma2 (Cy2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as set forth in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion protein. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of different Fc positions, including but not limited to positions 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358 as numbered by the EU index, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist. \n\n\n [0439] In one embodiment, the present disclosure encompasses Fc variant antibodies which have altered binding properties for an Fc ligand (e.g., an Fc receptor, Clq) relative to a native Fc antibody. Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to, binding specificity, equilibrium dissociation constant (IQ), dissociation and association rates (k\noff\n and k\non\n respectively), binding affinity and/or avidity. It is known in the art that the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kj) is defined as k\n0\nf/k\non\n. In certain aspects, an antibody comprising an Fc variant region with a low Ka may be more desirable to an antibody with a high IQ. However, in some instances the value of the k\non\n or k\n0ff\n may be more relevant than the value of the IQ. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application. For example, a modification that reduces binding to one or more positive regulator (e.g. , FcyRIIIA) and/or enhanced binding to an inhibitory Fc receptor (e.g. , FcyRIIB) would be suitable for reducing ADCC activity. Accordingly, the ratio of binding affinities (e.g. , the ratio of equilibrium dissociation constants (¾)) for different receptors can indicate if the ADCC activity of an Fc variant antibody of the disclosure is enhanced or decreased. Additionally, a modification that reduces binding to Clq would be suitable for reducing or eliminating CDC activity. \n\n\n [0440] In one embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit altered binding affinity for one or more Fc receptors including, but not limited to FcRn, FcyRI (CD64) including isoforms FcyRIA, FcyRIB, and FcyRIC; FcyRII (CD32 including isoforms FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and \n\n FcyRIIC); and FcyRIII (CD 16, including isoforms FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIIB) as compared to an native Fc antibody. \n\n\n [0441] In one embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to one or more\n\n\nFc ligand relative to a native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, the Fc variant antibody exhibits increased or decreased affinity for an Fc ligand that is at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or is between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, more or less than a native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for an Fc ligand that are at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 40%, at least 30%, at least 20%, at least 10%, or at least 5% more or less than an native Fc antibody. In certain embodiments, an Fc variant antibody has increased affinity for an Fc ligand. In other embodiments, an Fc variant antibody has decreased affinity for an Fc ligand. \n\n\n [0442] In a specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIIA. In another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIB. In a further specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to both the Fc receptors FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIB. In certain embodiments, Fc variant antibodies that have enhanced binding to FcyRIIIA do not have a concomitant increase in binding the FcyRIIB receptor as compared to a native Fc antibody. In a specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has reduced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIIA. In a further specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has reduced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIB. In still another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIB has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIB has altered binding to Clq relative to a native Fc antibody. \n\n\n [0443] In one embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for FcyRIIIA receptor that are at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or are \n\n\n- I l l - \n\n between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, more or less than an native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for FcyRIIIA that are at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 40%, at least 30%, at least 20%, at least 10%, or at least 5% more or less than an native Fc antibody. \n\n\n[0444] In one embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for FcyRIIB receptor that are at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or are between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, more or less than an native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for FcyRIIB that are at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 40%, at least 30%, at least 20%, at least 10%, or at least 5% more or less than an native Fc antibody. \n\n\n[0445] In one embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit increased or decreased affinities to Clq relative to a native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for Clq receptor that are at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or are between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, more or less than an native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for Clq that are at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 40%, at least 30%, at least 20%, at least 10%, or at least 5% more or less than an native Fc antibody. In still another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for Ciq has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for Clq has altered binding to FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIB relative to a native Fc antibody. \n\n\n [0446] It is well known in the art that antibodies are capable of directing the attack and destruction of targeted antigen through multiple processes collectively known in the art as antibody effector functions. One of these processes, known as \"antibody-dependent cell- \n\n mediated cytotoxicity\" or \"ADCC\" refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enables these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. Specific high- affinity IgG antibodies directed to the surface of target cells \"arm\" the cytotoxic cells and are required for such killing. Lysis of the target cell is extracellular, requires direct cell-to-cell contact, and does not involve complement. Another process encompassed by the term effector function is complement dependent cytotoxicity (hereinafter referred to as \"CDC\") which refers to a biochemical event of antibody-mediated target cell destruction by the complement system. The complement system is a complex system of proteins found in normal blood plasma that combines with antibodies to destroy pathogenic bacteria and other foreign cells. Still another process encompassed by the term effector function is antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) which refers to a cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express one or more effector ligands recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell. \n\n\n [0447] It is contemplated that Fc variant antibodies are characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more FcyR mediated effector cell functions. In certain embodiments, Fc variant antibodies have similar binding properties and effector cell functions in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present disclosure does not exclude Fc variant antibodies that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo. \n\n\n[0448] The serum half-life of proteins comprising Fc regions may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc region for FcRn. The term \"antibody half-life\" as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of an antibody that is a measure of the mean survival time of antibody molecules following their administration. Antibody half-life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate 50 percent of a known quantity of immunoglobulin from the patient's body (or other mammal) or a specific compartment thereof, for example, as measured in serum, i.e., circulating half- life, or in other tissues. Half-life may vary from one immunoglobulin or class of immunoglobulin to another. In general, an increase in antibody half-life results in an increase in mean residence time (MRT) in circulation for the antibody administered. \n\n [0449] The increase in half-life allows for the reduction in amount of drug given to a patient as well as reducing the frequency of administration. To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term \"salvage receptor binding epitope\" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule. Alternatively, antibodies of the disclosure with increased half-lives may be generated by modifying amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc and the FcRn receptor (see, for examples, US Patent Nos. 6,821,505 and 7,083,784; and WO 09/058492). In addition, the half-life of antibodies of the disclosure may be increase by conjugation to PEG or Albumin by techniques widely utilized in the art. In some embodiments antibodies comprising Fc variant regions of the disclosure have an increased half-life of about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%), about 100%), about 125%, about 150% or more as compared to an antibody comprising a native Fc region. In some embodiments antibodies comprising Fc variant regions have an increased half-life of about 2 fold, about 3 fold, about 4 fold, about 5 fold, about 10 fold, about 20 fold, about 50 fold or more, or is between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 25 fold, or between 15 fold and 50 fold, as compared to an antibody comprising a native Fc region. \n\n\n[0450] In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides Fc variants, wherein the Fc region comprises a modification (e.g., amino acid substitutions, amino acid insertions, amino acid deletions) at one or more positions chosen from 221, 225, 228, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 243, 244, 245, 247, 250, 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 279, 280, 284, 292, 296, 297, 298, 299, 305, 308, 313, 316, 318, 320, 322, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 339, 341, 343, 370, 373, 378, 392, 416, 419, 421, 428, 433, 434, 435, 436, 440, and 443 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. Optionally, the Fc region may comprise a modification at additional and/or alternative positions known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,624,821; 6,277,375; 6,737,056; 7,083,784; \n\n\n7,317,091; 7,217,797; 7,276,585; 7,355,008; 2002/0147311; 2004/0002587; 2005/0215768; 2007/0135620; 2007/0224188; 2008/0089892; WO 94/29351; and WO 99/58572).

In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution chosen from 239D, 330L, 330Y, and 332E as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. \n\n\n [0455] In a specific embodiment, the present disclosure provides an Fc variant antibody, wherein the Fc region comprises at least one non-naturally occurring amino acid at one or more positions chosen from 252, 254, and 256 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution chosen from 252Y, 254T and 256E as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. See, U.S. Patent Number 7,083,784, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n [0456] In certain embodiments the effector functions elicited by IgG antibodies strongly depend on the carbohydrate moiety linked to the Fc region of the protein (Claudia Ferrara et al., 2006, Biotechnology and Bioengineering 93:851-861). Thus, glycosylation of the Fc region can be modified to increase or decrease effector function (see for examples, Umana et al, 1999, Nat. Biotechnol 17: 176-180; Davies et al, 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294; Shields et al, 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al, 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,602,684; 6,946,292; 7,064,191; 7,214,775;7,393,683; 7,425,446; 7,504,256; U.S. Publication. Nos. 2003/0157108; 2003/0003097; 2009/0010921; POTILLEGENT™ technology (Biowa, Inc. Princeton, N.J.); GLYCOMAB™ glycosylation engineering technology (GLYCART \n\n\nbiotechnology AG, Zurich, Switzerland)). Accordingly, in one embodiment the Fc regions of \n\n anti-PAI-1 antibodies of the disclosure comprise altered glycosylation of amino acid residues. In another embodiment, the altered glycosylation of the amino acid residues results in lowered effector function. In another embodiment, the altered glycosylation of the amino acid residues results in increased effector function. In a specific embodiment, the Fc region has reduced fucosylation. In another embodiment, the Fc region is afucosylated (see for examples, U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2005/0226867). In one aspect, these antibodies with increased effector function, specifically ADCC, as generated in host cells (e.g., CHO cells, Lemna minor) engineered to produce highly defucosylated antibody with over 100-fold higher ADCC compared to antibody produced by the parental cells (Mori et al., 2004, Biotechnol Bioeng 88:901-908; Cox et al, 2006, Nat Biotechnol, 24: 1591-7). \n\n\n [0457] Addition of sialic acid to the oligosaccharides on IgG molecules can enhance their anti-inflammatory activity and alters their cytotoxicity (Keneko et al., Science, 2006, 313:670- 673; Scallon et al, Mol. Immuno. 2007 Mar;44(7): 1524-34). The studies referenced above demonstrate that IgG molecules with increased sialylation have anti-inflammatory properties whereas IgG molecules with reduced sialylation have increased immunostimulatory properties (e.g., increase ADCC activity). Therefore, an antibody can be modified with an appropriate sialylation profile for a particular therapeutic application (US Publication No. 2009/0004179 and International Publication No. WO 2007/005786). \n\n\n [0458] In one embodiment, the Fc regions of antibodies of the disclosure comprise an altered sialylation profile compared to the native Fc region. In one embodiment, the Fc regions of antibodies of the disclosure comprise an increased sialylation profile compared to the native Fc region. In another embodiment, the Fc regions of antibodies of the disclosure comprise a decreased sialylation profile compared to the native Fc region. \n\n\n [0459] In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present disclosure may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Ghetie et al, 1997, Nat Biotech. 15:637- 40; Duncan et al, 1988, Nature 332:563-564; Lund et al, 1991, J.

Other modifications and/or substitutions and/or additions and/or deletions of the Fc domain will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. \n\n\n 13. Glycosylation \n\n\n [0460] In addition to the ability of glycosylation to alter the effector function of antibodies, modified glycosylation in the variable region can alter the affinity of the antibody for a target antigen. In one embodiment, the glycosylation pattern in the variable region of the present antibodies is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for a target antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861. One or more amino acid substitutions can also be made that result in elimination of a glycosylation site present in the Fc region (e.g., Asparagine 297 of IgG). Furthermore, aglycosylated antibodies may be produced in bacterial cells which lack the necessary glycosylation machinery. \n\n\n 14. Antibody Conjugates \n\n\n [0461] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure are conjugated or covalently attached to a substance using methods well known in the art. In one embodiment, the attached substance is a therapeutic agent, a detectable label (also referred to herein as a reporter molecule) or a solid support. Suitable substances for attachment to antibodies include, but are not limited to, an amino acid, a peptide, a protein, a polysaccharide, a nucleoside, a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid, a hapten, a drug, a hormone, a lipid, a lipid assembly, a synthetic polymer, a polymeric microparticle, a biological cell, a virus, a fluorophore, a \n\n chromophore, a dye, a toxin, a hapten, an enzyme, an antibody, an antibody fragment, a radioisotope, solid matrixes, semi-solid matrixes and combinations thereof. Methods for conjugation or covalently attaching another substance to an antibody are well known in the art. \n\n\n[0462] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure are conjugated to a solid support. Antibodies may be conjugated to a solid support as part of the screening and/or purification and/or manufacturing process. Alternatively antibodies of the disclosure may be conjugated to a solid support as part of a diagnostic method or composition. A solid support suitable for use in the present disclosure is typically substantially insoluble in liquid phases. A large number of supports are available and are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, solid supports include solid and semi-solid matrixes, such as aerogels and hydrogels, resins, beads, biochips (including thin film coated biochips), microfluidic chip, a silicon chip, multi-well plates (also referred to as microtitre plates or microplates), membranes, conducting and nonconducting metals, glass (including microscope slides) and magnetic supports. More specific examples of solid supports include silica gels, polymeric membranes, particles, derivatized plastic films, glass beads, cotton, plastic beads, alumina gels, polysaccharides such as Sepharose, poly(acrylate), polystyrene, poly(acrylamide), polyol, agarose, agar, cellulose, dextran, starch, FICOLL, heparin, glycogen, amylopectin, mannan, inulin, nitrocellulose, diazocellulose, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyethylene (including poly(ethylene glycol)), nylon, latex bead, magnetic bead, paramagnetic bead, superparamagnetic bead, starch and the like. \n\n\n[0463] In some embodiments, the solid support may include a reactive functional group, including, but not limited to, hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, thiol, aldehyde, halogen, nitro, cyano, amido, urea, carbonate, carbamate, isocyanate, sulfone, sulfonate, sulfonamide, sulfoxide, etc., for attaching the antibodies of the disclosure. \n\n\n [0464] A suitable solid phase support can be selected on the basis of desired end use and suitability for various synthetic protocols. For example, where amide bond formation is desirable to attach the antibodies of the disclosure to the solid support, resins generally useful in peptide synthesis may be employed, such as polystyrene (e.g. , PAM-resin obtained from Bachem Inc., Peninsula Laboratories, etc.), POLYHIPE™ resin (obtained from Aminotech, Canada), polyamide resin (obtained from Peninsula Laboratories), polystyrene resin grafted with polyethylene glycol (TENTAGEL™, Rapp Polymere, Tubingen, Germany), polydimethyl- \n\n acrylamide resin (available from Milligen/Biosearch, California), or PEGA beads (obtained from Polymer Laboratories). \n\n\n [0465] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the disclosure are conjugated to labels for purposes of diagnostics and other assays wherein the antibody and/or its associated ligand may be detected. A label conjugated to an antibody and used in the present methods and compositions described herein, is any chemical moiety, organic or inorganic, that exhibits an absorption maximum at wavelengths greater than 280 nm, and retains its spectral properties when covalently attached to an antibody. Labels include, without limitation, a chromophore, a fluorophore, a fluorescent protein, a phosphorescent dye, a tandem dye, a particle, a hapten, an enzyme and a radioisotope. \n\n\n [0466] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies are conjugated to a \n\n\nfluorophore. As such, fluorophores used to label antibodies of the disclosure include, without limitation; a pyrene (including any of the corresponding derivative compounds disclosed in US Patent 5,132,432), an anthracene, a naphthalene, an acridine, a stilbene, an indole or benzindole, an oxazole or benzoxazole, a thiazole or benzothiazole, a 4-amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-l, 3- diazole (NBD), a cyanine (including any corresponding compounds in US Patent Nos.6, 977,305 and 6,974,873), a carbocyanine (including any corresponding compounds in US Serial Nos. 09/557,275; U.S.; Patents Nos. 4,981,977; 5,268,486; 5,569,587; 5,569,766; 5,486,616; \n\n\n5,627,027; 5,808,044; 5,877,310; 6,002,003; 6,004,536; 6,008,373; 6,043,025; 6,127,134; \n\n\n6,130,094; 6,133,445; and publications WO 02/26891, WO 97/40104, WO 99/51702, WO 01/21624; EP 1 065 250 Al), a carbostyryl, a porphyrin, a salicylate, an anthranilate, an azulene, a perylene, a pyridine, a quinoline, a borapolyazaindacene (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,774,339; 5,187,288; 5,248,782; 5,274,113; and 5,433,896), a xanthene (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,162,931; 6,130,101; 6,229,055; 6,339,392; 5,451,343; 5,227,487; 5,442,045; 5,798,276; \n\n\n5,846,737; 4,945,171; US serial Nos. 09/129,015 and 09/922,333), an oxazine (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent No. 4,714,763) or a benzoxazine, a carbazine (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent No. 4,810,636), a phenalenone, a coumarin (including an corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent Nos. 5,696,157; 5,459,276; 5,501,980 and 5,830,912), a benzofuran (including an corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,603,209 and 4,849,362) and benzphenalenone (including any \n\n corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent No. 4,812,409) and derivatives thereof. As used herein, oxazines include resorufms (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in 5,242,805), aminooxazinones, diaminooxazines, and their benzo-substituted analogs. \n\n\n[0467] In a specific embodiment, the fluorophores conjugated to the antibodies described herein include xanthene (rhodol, rhodamine, fluorescein and derivatives thereof) coumarin, cyanine, pyrene, oxazine and borapolyazaindacene. In other embodiments, such fluorophores are sulfonated xanthenes, fluorinated xanthenes, sulfonated coumarins, fluorinated coumarins and sulfonated cyanines. Also included are dyes sold under the tradenames, and generally known as, Alexa Fluor, DyLight, Cy Dyes, BODIPY, Oregon Green, Pacific Blue, IRDyes, FAM, FITC, and ROX. \n\n\n [0468] The choice of the fluorophore attached to the anti-PAI-1 antibody will determine the absorption and fluorescence emission properties of the conjugated antibody. Physical properties of a fluorophore label that can be used for antibody and antibody bound ligands include, but are not limited to, spectral characteristics (absorption, emission and stokes shift), fluorescence intensity, lifetime, polarization and photo-bleaching rate, or combination thereof. All of these physical properties can be used to distinguish one fluorophore from another, and thereby allow for multiplexed analysis. In certain embodiments, the fluorophore has an absorption maximum at wavelengths greater than 480 nm. In other embodiments, the fluorophore absorbs at or near 488 nm to 514 nm (particularly suitable for excitation by the output of the argon-ion laser excitation source) or near 546 nm (particularly suitable for excitation by a mercury arc lamp). In other embodiment a fluorophore can emit in the NIR (near infra red region) for tissue or whole organism applications. Other desirable properties of the fluorescent label may include cell permeability and low toxicity, for example if labeling of the antibody is to be performed in a cell or an organism (e.g., a living animal). \n\n\n[0469] In certain embodiments, an enzyme is a label and is conjugated to an anti-PAI-1 antibody. Enzymes are desirable labels because amplification of the detectable signal can be obtained resulting in increased assay sensitivity. The enzyme itself does not produce a detectable response but functions to break down a substrate when it is contacted by an appropriate substrate such that the converted substrate produces a fluorescent, colorimetric or luminescent signal. Enzymes amplify the detectable signal because one enzyme on a labeling reagent can result in multiple substrates being converted to a detectable signal. The enzyme \n\n substrate is selected to yield the preferred measurable product, e.g. colorimetric, fluorescent or chemiluminescence. Such substrates are extensively used in the art and are well known by one skilled in the art. \n\n\n [0470] In one embodiment, colorimetric or fluorogenic substrate and enzyme combination uses oxidoreductases such as horseradish peroxidase and a substrate such as 3,3'- diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC), which yield a distinguishing color (brown and red, respectively). Other colorimetric oxidoreductase substrates that yield detectable products include, but are not limited to: 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6- sulfonic acid) (ABTS), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), o- dianisidine, 5 -aminosalicylic acid, 4-chloro-l-naphthol. Fluorogenic substrates include, but are not limited to, homovanillic acid or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid, reduced phenoxazines and reduced benzothiazines, including AMPLEX\n®\n Red reagent and its variants (U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,042) and reduced dihydroxanthenes, including dihydrofluoresceins (U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,931) and dihydrorhodamines including dihydrorhodamine 123. Peroxidase substrates that are tyramides (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,196,306; 5,583,001 and 5,731,158) represent a unique class of peroxidase substrates in that they can be intrinsically detectable before action of the enzyme but are \"fixed in place\" by the action of a peroxidase in the process described as tyramide signal amplification (TSA). These substrates are extensively utilized to label targets in samples that are cells, tissues or arrays for their subsequent detection by microscopy, flow cytometry, optical scanning and fluorometry. \n\n\n [0471] In another embodiment, a colorimetric (and in some cases fluorogenic) substrate and enzyme combination uses a phosphatase enzyme such as an acid phosphatase, an alkaline phosphatase or a recombinant version of such a phosphatase in combination with a colorimetric substrate such as 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), 6-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, /?-nitrophenyl phosphate, or o-nitrophenyl phosphate or with a fluorogenic substrate such as 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy-4- methylcoumarinyl phosphate (DiFMUP, U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,912) fluorescein diphosphate, 3-0- methylfluorescein phosphate, resorufm phosphate, H-(l,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one- 7-yl) phosphate (DDAO phosphate), or ELF 97, ELF 39 or related phosphates (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,316,906 and 5,443,986). \n\n [0472] Glycosidases, in particular beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase and beta- glucosidase, are additional suitable enzymes. Appropriate colorimetric substrates include, but are not limited to, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and similar indolyl galactosides, glucosides, and glucuronides, o-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside. In one embodiment, fluorogenic substrates include resorufm beta-D-galactopyranoside, fluorescein digalactoside (FDG), fluorescein diglucuronide and their structural variants (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,148; 5,242,805; 5,362,628; 5,576,424 and 5,773,236), 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-galactopyranoside, carboxyumbelliferyl beta-D-galactopyranoside and fluorinated coumarin beta-D- galactopyranosides (U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,912). \n\n\n [0473] Additional enzymes include, but are not limited to, hydrolases such as \n\n\ncholinesterases and peptidases, oxidases such as glucose oxidase and cytochrome oxidases, and reductases for which suitable substrates are known. \n\n\n [0474] Enzymes and their appropriate substrates that produce chemiluminescence are preferred for some assays. These include, but are not limited to, natural and recombinant forms of luciferases and aequorins. Chemiluminescence-producing substrates for phosphatases, glycosidases and oxidases such as those containing stable dioxetanes, luminol, isoluminol and acridinium esters are additionally useful. \n\n\n [0475] In another embodiment, haptens such as biotin, are also utilized as labels. Biotin is useful because it can function in an enzyme system to further amplify the detectable signal, and it can function as a tag to be used in affinity chromatography for isolation purposes. For detection purposes, an enzyme conjugate that has affinity for biotin is used, such as avidin-HRP. Subsequently a peroxidase substrate is added to produce a detectable signal. \n\n\n[0476] Haptens also include hormones, naturally occurring and synthetic drugs, pollutants, allergens, affector molecules, growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, lymphokines, amino acids, peptides, chemical intermediates, nucleotides and the like. \n\n\n [0477] In certain embodiments, fluorescent proteins may be conjugated to the antibodies as a label. Examples of fluorescent proteins include green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the phycobiliproteins and the derivatives thereof. The fluorescent proteins, especially \n\n\nphycobiliprotein, are particularly useful for creating tandem dye labeled labeling reagents. These tandem dyes comprise a fluorescent protein and a fluorophore for the purposes of obtaining a \n\n larger stokes shift wherein the emission spectra is farther shifted from the wavelength of the fluorescent protein's absorption spectra. This is particularly advantageous for detecting a low quantity of a target in a sample wherein the emitted fluorescent light is maximally optimized, in other words little to none of the emitted light is reabsorbed by the fluorescent protein. For this to work, the fluorescent protein and fluorophore function as an energy transfer pair wherein the fluorescent protein emits at the wavelength that the fluorophore absorbs at and the fluorophore then emits at a wavelength farther from the fluorescent proteins than could have been obtained with only the fluorescent protein. A particularly useful combination is the phycobiliproteins disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,520,110; 4,859,582; 5,055,556 and the sulforhodamine \n\n\nfluorophores disclosed in US Patent No. 5,798,276, or the sulfonated cyanine fluorophores disclosed in US Patent Nos. 6,977,305 and 6,974,873; or the sulfonated xanthene derivatives disclosed in US Patent No. 6,130,101 and those combinations disclosed in US Patent No. \n\n\n4,542,104. Alternatively, the fluorophore functions as the energy donor and the fluorescent protein is the energy acceptor. \n\n\n [0478] In certain embodiments, the label is a radioactive isotope. Examples of suitable \n\n\n 121 123 125 131 14 radioactive materials include, but are not limited to, iodine ( I, I, I, I), carbon ( C), sulfur (\n35\nS), tritium (\n3\nH), indium (\nΠ 1\n1η,' \n112\nIn, \n113\nmln, \n115\nmln,), technetium (\n99\nTc, \n99\nmTc), thallium (\n201\nTi), gallium (\n68\nGa, \n67\nGa), palladium (\n103\nPd), molybdenum (\n99\nMo), xenon (\n135\nXe), fluorine (\n18\nF), \n153\nSM, \n177\nLu, \n159\nGd, \n149\nPm, \n140\nLa, \n175\nYb, \n166\nHo, \n90\nY, \n47\nSc, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe,\n142\nPr, \n105\n Rh and \n97\n Ru. \n\n\n E. Methods of Use \n\n\n 1. Diagnostic Methods of Use \n\n\n [0479] In certain embodiments, anti-PAI-1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the disclosure may be used in vivo and/or in vitro for detecting PAI-1 expression in cells and tissue or for imaging PAI-1 expressing cells and tissues. In certain embodiments, the antibodies are human antibodies and such antibodies are used to image PAI-1 expression in a living human patient. Given that the anti-PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments described herein immunospecifically bind to human PAI-1 and inhibit PAI-1 activity, such as by inhibiting binding of PAI-1 to tPA, but do not inhibit formation or stability of a PAI-1 : vitronectin complex, these antibodies can be used to detect or image PAI-1 expression in a living patient. \n\n [0480] Moreover, given that exemplary antibodies of the disclosure specifically bind to human PAI-1, as well as PAI-1 from one or more of mouse, rat, cynomolgous, etc., such antibodies are useful for in vitro or in vivo imaging, testing, analysis, etc., of samples in animal models. \n\n\n [0481] By way of example, diagnostic uses can be achieved, for example, by contacting a sample to be tested, optionally along with a control sample, with the antibody under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the antibody and PAI-1. Complex formation is then detected (e.g., using an ELISA or by imaging to detect a moiety attached to the antibody). When using a control sample along with the test sample, complex is detected in both samples and any statistically significant difference in the formation of complexes between the samples is indicative of the presence of PAI-1 in the test sample. \n\n\n [0482] In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of determining the presence of PAI-1 in a sample suspected of containing PAI-1, said method comprising exposing the sample to an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure, and determining binding of the antibody to PAI-1 in the sample wherein binding of the antibody to PAI-1 in the sample is indicative of the presence of the PAI-1 in the sample. In one embodiment, the sample is a biological sample. \n\n\n[0483] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies may be used to detect the overexpression or amplification of PAI-1 using an in vivo or ex vivo diagnostic assay. In one embodiment, the anti-PAI-1 antibody is added to a sample wherein the antibody binds the PAI -1 to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label (e.g. a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent label) and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label. \n\n\n[0484] Alternatively, or additionally, FISH assays such as the INFORM™ (sold by\n\n\nVentana, Ariz.) or PATHVISION™ (Vysis, 111.) may be carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded tissue to determine the extent (if any) of PAI-1 expression or overexpression in a sample. \n\n\n [0485] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the disclosure may be used in vivo and/or in vitro for diagnosing PAI-1 associated diseases. This can be achieved, for example, by contacting a sample to be tested, optionally along with a control sample, with the antibody under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the antibody and PAI-1. Complex formation is then detected (e.g., using an ELISA). When using a control sample along with the test sample, complex is detected in both samples \n\n and any statistically significant difference in the formation of complexes between the samples is indicative of the presence of PAI-1 in the test sample. \n\n\n [0486] In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of determining the presence of PAI-1 in a sample suspected of containing PAI-1, said method comprising exposing the sample to an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure, and determining binding of the antibody to PAI-1 in the sample wherein binding of the antibody to PAI-1 in the sample is indicative of the presence of the PAI-1 in the sample. In one embodiment, the sample is a biological sample. In one embodiment, the biological sample is from a mammal experiencing or suspected of experiencing a PAI-1 associated disease/disorder. \n\n\n [0487] In certain embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies may be used in a method of detecting soluble PAI-1 in blood or serum. In one embodiment, the method comprises contacting a test sample of blood or serum from a mammal suspected of experiencing a PAI-1 disorder with an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure and detecting an increase in soluble PAI-1 in the test sample relative to a control sample of blood or serum from a normal mammal. In one embodiment, the method of detecting is useful as a method of diagnosing a PAI-1 disorder associated with an increase in soluble PAI-1 in blood or serum of a mammal. \n\n\n[0488] In another aspect, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies may be used to inhibit coagulation in blood samples and blood products ex vivo. This feature can be applied to processing of blood samples, blood banking, and the like. \n\n\n 2. Therapeutic Methods of Uses \n\n\n[0489] In certain aspects, the anti-PAI-1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the disclosure may be administered for prevention and/or treatment of a subject in need of treatment for one or more cardiovascular diseases. The disclosure encompasses methods of preventing, treating, maintaining, ameliorating, or inhibiting PAI-1 associated or exacerbated aspects of cardiovascular disease in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-PAI-1 antibody to the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittently as directed by physician. In certain embodiments, the PAI-1 associated or exacerbated aspects of cardiovascular disease include thrombus formation, such as arterial thrombus formation. In certain embodiments, the subject is a subject with atherosclerosis. Administration of an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure to such a subject may be used to help reduce thrombosis in such a patient, for \n\n example, to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, angina, and/or stroke. More generally, administration of an anti-PAI-1 antibody can be used alone or as part of an overall treatment plan to treat patients having any one or more of the following diseases and conditions: angina, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, cardiac insufficiency, coronary thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral artery occlusive disease and stroke. \n\n\n [0490] Any of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments, as well as \n\n\ncompositions, having any one or more of the structural and functional features described herein can be used in a method of treating a human patient. \n\n\n [0491] In certain embodiments, treating said patient comprises reducing the risk of thrombosis in the patients suffering from cardiovascular disease. In certain embodiments, treating said patient comprises reducing the risk and/or severity of myocardial infarction or stroke in such a patient, including a patient with atherosclerosis. \n\n\n [0492] In certain embodiments, treating said patient comprises reducing the risk of deep vein thrombosis following surgery. In such embodiments, the anti-PAI-1 antibody can be administered prior to (such as just prior to), during, or after surgery. \n\n\n [0493] In certain embodiments, the patient is suffering from peripheral artery occlusive disease. \n\n\n [0494] In certain embodiments, the antibodies are used instead of traditional anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin, Coumadin, heparin, etc.) or help reduce the dosage of such therapy. In certain embodiments, the antibodies are used together with (administered at the same or differing time) traditional anti-coagulation therapy and/or aspirin. \n\n\n [0495] Antibodies of the disclosure can be administered alone or as part of an overall treatment regimen appropriate for the particular cardiovascular disease or condition. By way of example, antibodies of the disclosure can be administered as part of a treatment plan that includes one or more of smoking cessation, diet modification, an exercise regimen, stress management, aspirin, beta-blockers, and compression stockings. By way of further example, antibodies of the disclosure can be administered (alone or with other therapeutics or treatment modalities) as part of a treatment plan that includes surgery, such as bypass surgery, or angioplasty. \n\n\n [0496] In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering antibodies of the disclosure (e.g., antibodies or fragments) systemically, such as intravenously. In certain \n\n embodiments, the method comprises administering antibodies of the disclosure locally, such as via a stent or wire. \n\n\n [0497] Illustrative examples of cardiovascular diseases and conditions that can be treated, along with animal models that can be used to test the efficacy and safety of the treatment, are provided below. \n\n\n a) Coronary thromobosis \n\n\n [0498] Coronary thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombosis) within a coronary artery or vein. Such clots reduce blood flow to the heart, which can lead to tissue damage and infarction. In some cases, clots also break free and form an embolus. Effects of coronary thrombosis can be studied in animal models, such as balloon angioplasty in canines (Katsuragawa et al., An animal model of coronary thrombosis and thrombolysis—comparisons of vascular damage and thrombus formation in the coronary and femoral arteries after balloon angioplasty. J/w Circ J,. 1993, 57(10): 1000-6). \n\n\n b) Stroke \n\n\n [0499] Stroke is the loss of brain function resulting from a disturbance of blood flow to the brain, typically caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel (ischemic stroke), or by \n\n\naccumulation of blood in the skull (hemorrhagic stroke). Ischemic stroke may be caused by thrombosis, embolism, systemic hypoperfusion, or venous thrombosis, and can lead to death of brain tissue. Pathophysiological consequences of stroke can be studied in animal models by ligating or occluding carotid arteries or cerebral arteries in rodents or non-human primates and measuring neuronal injury or death (see for example, Feuerstein and Wang, Animal Models of Stroke. Molecular Medicine Today, 2002, 6(3): 133-135; Mergenthaler et al. Pathophysiology of Stroke: Lessons from Animal Models. Metabolic Brain Disease, 2004, 19(3-4): 151-167; and Manual of Stroke Models in Rats, edited by Wang-Fischer, 2008). \n\n\n c) Myocardial Infarction \n\n\n [0500] During a myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack, the blood supply to the heart is disrupted or discontinued, resulting in localized damage or death of heart cells. MI is commonly caused by occlusion of a coronary artery, following rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Because ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of congestive heart failure, many research studies aim to elucidate molecular mechanisms of MI and identify target molecules for therapy. For example, animal models have provided systems for studying spontaneous MI \n\n (Shiomi et al, Development of an Animal Model for Spontaneous Myocardial Infarction \n\n\n(WHHLMI Rabbit). Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, 2003; 23: 1239) and pathogenesis of MI (Ravinay et al., Rat Models of Myocardial Infarction: Pathogenetic Insights and Clinical Relevance. Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2006, 96(5): 602-610). In addition, transgenic mouse models are particularly useful for characterizing molecular mechanisms of MI (Chimenti et al, Myocardial Infarction: Animal Models, Methods Mo I Med., 2004, 98: 217-26). \n\n\n d) Deep Vein Thrombosis \n\n\n[0501] Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is prevalent condition in the human population, characterized by the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, such as a leg vein, pelvic vein or arm vein. A DVT may manifest as swelling, painful, and engorged veins in the affected extremity. The clot may also dislodge and cause a pulmonary embolism in the lungs. Animal models have been developed to study DVT, including rat models (Myers et al, Chapter 70 Coagulation Biology, in Surgical Research, edited by Souba and Wilmore, 2001, Academic Press), and swine models (Roy et al, Animal Model of Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis. \n\n\nCardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, 1998, 21(4). In humans, DVT can be a complication of surgery and this complication can be prevented by interventions prior to, during, or just after surgery. \n\n\n F.

In a specific embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure comprises trehalose and an amino acid at a molar ratio of about 2.7. \n\n\n [0524] The formulations of the disclosure may further comprise a surfactant. The term\n\n\n\"surfactant\" as used herein refers to organic substances having amphipathic structures; namely, they are composed of groups of opposing solubility tendencies, typically an oil-soluble hydrocarbon chain and a water-soluble ionic group. Surfactants can be classified, depending on the charge of the surface-active moiety, into anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants. \n\n\nSurfactants are often used as wetting, emulsifying, solubilizing, and dispersing agents for various pharmaceutical compositions and preparations of biological materials. Pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants like polysorbates (e.g. polysorbates 20 or 80); polyoxamers (e.g. \n\n\npoloxamer 188); Triton; sodium octyl glycoside; lauryl-, myristyl-, linoleyl-, or stearyl- sulfobetaine; lauryl-, myristyl-, linoleyl- or stearyl-sarcosine; linoleyl-, myristyl-, or cetyl- betaine; lauroamidopropyl-, cocamidopropyl-, linoleamidopropyl-, myristamidopropyl-, palmidopropyl-, or isostearamidopropyl-betaine (e.g. lauroamidopropyl); myristamidopropyl-, palmidopropyl-, or isostearamidopropyl-dimethylamine; sodium methyl cocoyl-, or disodium methyl oleyl-taurate; and the MONAQUA™ series (Mona Industries, Inc., Paterson, N.J.), polyethyl glycol, polypropyl glycol, and copolymers of ethylene and propylene glycol (e.g. \n\n\nPLURONICS™, PF68 etc), can optionally be added to the formulations of the disclosure to reduce aggregation. In one embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure comprises Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 40, Polysorbate 60, or Polysorbate 80. Surfactants are particularly useful if a pump or plastic container is used to administer the formulation. The presence of a \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable surfactant mitigates the propensity for the protein to aggregate. In a specific embodiment, the formulations of the disclosure comprise a polysorbate which is at a concentration ranging from between about 0.001% to about 1%, or about 0.001% to about 0.1%, or about 0.01% to about 0.1%. In other specific embodiments, the formulations of the disclosure comprise a polysorbate which is at a concentration of 0.001%, or 0.002%>, or 0.003%), or 0.004%>, or 0.005%, or 0.006%, or 0.007%, or 0.008%, or 0.009%, or 0.01%, or 0.015%, or 0.02%. In \n\n another specific embodiment, the polysorbate is polysorbate-80. In a specific embodiment, the formulations of the disclosure comprise a polysorbate which is at a concentration ranging from between 0.001% to 1%, or 0.001% to 0.1%, or 0.01% to 0.1%.

In a specific embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure comprises about 0.005%) Polysorbate 80. In a specific embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure comprises about 0.025% Polysorbate 80. In a specific embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure comprises about 0.02% \n\n\nPolysorbate 80. In a specific embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure comprises about 0.1% Polysorbate 80. \n\n\n [0526] In certain embodiments, the formulations of the disclosure may optionally further comprise other common excipients and/or additives including, but not limited to, diluents, binders, stabilizers, lipophilic solvents, preservatives, adjuvants, or the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and/or additives may be used in the formulations of the disclosure. \n\n\nCommonly used excipients/additives, such as pharmaceutically acceptable chelators (for example, but not limited to, EDTA, DTPA or EGTA) can optionally be added to the \n\n formulations of the disclosure to reduce aggregation. These additives are particularly useful if a pump or plastic container is used to administer the formulation. \n\n\n [0527] Preservatives, such as phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, chlorocresol, benzyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrite, phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, chlorobutanol, magnesium chloride (for example, but not limited to, hexahydrate), alkylparaben (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like), benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, sodium dehydroacetate and thimerosal, or mixtures thereof can optionally be added to the formulations of the disclosure at any suitable concentration such as between about 0.001% to about 5%, or any range or value therein. The concentration of preservative used in the formulations of the disclosure is a concentration sufficient to yield a microbial effect. Such concentrations are dependent on the preservative selected and are readily determined by the skilled artisan. \n\n\n[0528] Other contemplated excipients/additives, which may be utilized in the \n\n\nformulations of the disclosure include, for example, flavoring agents, antimicrobial agents, sweeteners, antioxidants, antistatic agents, lipids such as phospholipids or fatty acids, steroids such as cholesterol, protein excipients such as serum albumin (human serum albumin (HSA), recombinant human albumin (rHA), gelatin, casein, salt-forming counterions such as sodium and the like. These and additional known pharmaceutical excipients and/or additives suitable for use in the formulations of the disclosure are known in the art, e.g., as listed in \"Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy\", 21\nst\n ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (2005), and in the \"Physician's Desk Reference\", 60\nth\n ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, N.J. (2005). \n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be routinely selected that are suitable for the mode of administration, solubility and/or stability of anti-PAI-1 antibody, as well known those in the art or as described herein. \n\n\n [0529] It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the formulations of the disclosure may be isotonic with human blood, wherein the formulations of the disclosure have essentially the same osmotic pressure as human blood. Such isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 mOSm to about 350 mOSm. Isotonicity can be measured by, for example, using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer. Tonicity of a formulation is adjusted by the use of tonicity modifiers. \"Tonicity modifiers\" are those pharmaceutically acceptable inert substances that can be added to the formulation to provide an \n\n isotonity of the formulation. Tonicity modifiers suitable for this disclosure include, but are not limited to, saccharides, salts and amino acids. \n\n\n [0530] In certain embodiments, the formulations of the present disclosure have an osmotic pressure from about 100 mOSm to about 1200 mOSm, or from about 200 mOSm to about 1000 mOSm, or from about 200 mOSm to about 800 mOSm, or from about 200 mOSm to about 600 mOSm, or from about 250 mOSm to about 500 mOSm, or from about 250 mOSm to about 400 mOSm, or from about 250 mOSm to about 350 mOSm. \n\n\n[0531] The concentration of any one component or any combination of various components, of the formulations of the disclosure is adjusted to achieve the desired tonicity of the final formulation. For example, the ratio of the carbohydrate excipient to antibody may be adjusted according to methods known in the art (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,685,940). In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of the carbohydrate excipient to antibody may be from about 100 moles to about 1000 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody, or from about 200 moles to about 6000 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody, or from about 100 moles to about 510 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody, or from about 100 moles to about 600 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody. \n\n\n[0532] The desired isotonicity of the final formulation may also be achieved by adjusting the salt concentration of the formulations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and those suitable for this disclosure as tonicity modifiers include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, sodium succinate, sodium sulfate, potassuim chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. In specific embodiments, formulations of the disclosure s comprise NaCl, MgCl\n2\n, and/or CaCl\n2\n. In one embodiment, concentration of NaCl is between about 75 mM and about 150 mM. In another embodiment, concentration of MgCl\n2\n is between about 1 mM and about 100 mM. Pharmaceutically acceptable amino acids including those suitable for this disclosure as tonicity modifiers include, but are not limited to, proline, alanine, L-arginine, asparagine, L-aspartic acid, glycine, serine, lysine, and histidine. \n\n\n[0533] In one embodiment the formulations of the disclosure are pyrogen- free formulations which are substantially free of endotoxins and/or related pyrogenic substances. Endotoxins include toxins that are confined inside a microorganism and are released only when the microorganisms are broken down or die. Pyrogenic substances also include fever-inducing, thermostable substances (glycoproteins) from the outer membrane of bacteria and other \n\n microorganisms. Both of these substances can cause fever, hypotension and shock if administered to humans. Due to the potential harmful effects, even low amounts of endotoxins must be removed from intravenously administered pharmaceutical drug solutions. The Food & Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has set an upper limit of 5 endotoxin units (EU) per dose per kilogram body weight in a single one hour period for intravenous drug applications (The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Pharmacopeial Forum 26 (1):223 (2000)). When therapeutic proteins are administered in amounts of several hundred or thousand milligrams per kilogram body weight, as can be the case with antibodies, even trace amounts of harmful and dangerous endotoxin must be removed. In certain specific embodiments, the endotoxin and pyrogen levels in the composition are less then 10 EU/mg, or less then 5 EU/mg, or less then 1 EU/mg, or less then 0.1 EU/mg, or less then 0.01 EU/mg, or less then 0.001 EU/mg. \n\n\n [0534] When used for in vivo administration, the formulations of the disclosure should be sterile. The formulations of the disclosure may be sterilized by various sterilization methods, including sterile filtration, radiation, etc. In one embodiment, the antibody formulation is filter- sterilized with a presterilized 0.22-micron filter. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in \"Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy\", 21\nst\n ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (2005). Formulations comprising antibodies, such as those disclosed herein, ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. It is contemplated that sterile compositions comprising antibodies are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having an adapter that allows retrieval of the formulation, such as a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. In one embodiment, a composition of the disclosure is provided as a pre-filled syringe. \n\n\n [0535] In one embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure is a lyophilized formulation.\n\n\nThe term \"lyophilized\" or \"freeze-dried\" includes a state of a substance that has been subjected to a drying procedure such as lyophilization, where at least 50% of moisture has been removed. \n\n\n[0536] The phrase \"bulking agent\" includes a compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that adds bulk to a lyo cake. Bulking agents known to the art include, for example, carbohydrates, including simple sugars such as dextrose, ribose, fructose and the like, alcohol sugars such as mannitol, inositol and sorbitol, disaccharides including trehalose, sucrose \n\n and lactose, naturally occurring polymers such as starch, dextrans, chitosan, hyaluronate, proteins (e.g., gelatin and serum albumin), glycogen, and synthetic monomers and polymers. \n\n\n[0537] A \"lyoprotectant\" is a molecule which, when combined with a protein of interest\n\n\n(such as an anti-PAI-1 antibody), significantly prevents or reduces chemical and/or physical instability of the protein upon lyophilization and subsequent storage. Lyoprotectants include, but are not limited to, sugars and their corresponding sugar alcohols; an amino acid such as monosodium glutamate or histidine; a methylamine such as betaine; a lyotropic salt such as magnesium sulfate; a polyol such as trihydric or higher molecular weight sugar alcohols, e.g. glycerin, dextran, erythritol, glycerol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol; propylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; PLURONICS™; and combinations thereof. Additional examples of lyoprotectants include, but are not limited to, glycerin and gelatin, and the sugars mellibiose, melezitose, raffmose, mannotriose and stachyose. Examples of reducing sugars include, but are not limited to, glucose, maltose, lactose, maltulose, iso-maltulose and lactulose. Examples of non-reducing sugars include, but are not limited to, non-reducing glycosides of polyhydroxy compounds selected from sugar alcohols and other straight chain polyalcohols. Examples of sugar alcohols include, but are not limited to, monoglycosides, compounds obtained by reduction of disaccharides such as lactose, maltose, lactulose and maltulose. The glycosidic side group can be either glucosidic or galactosidic. Additional examples of sugar alcohols include, but are not limited to, glucitol, maltitol, lactitol and iso-maltulose. In specific embodiments, trehalose or sucrose is used as a lyoprotectant. \n\n\n [0538] The lyoprotectant is added to the pre-lyophilized formulation in a \"lyoprotecting amount\" which means that, following lyophilization of the protein in the presence of the lyoprotecting amount of the lyoprotectant, the protein essentially retains its physical and chemical stability and integrity upon lyophilization and storage. \n\n\n [0539] In one embodiment, the molar ratio of a lyoprotectant (e.g., trehalose) and anti-\n\n\nPAI-1 antibody molecules of a formulation of the disclosure is at least about 10, at least about 50, at least about 100, at least about 200, or at least about 300. In another embodiment, the molar ratio of a lyoprotectant (e.g., trehalose) and anti-PAI-1 antibody molecules of a \n\n\nformulation of the disclosure is about 1, is about 2, is about 5, is about 10, about 50, about 100, about 200, or about 300. \n\n [0540] A \"reconstituted\" formulation is one which has been prepared by dissolving a lyophilized antibody formulation in a diluent such that the antibody is dispersed in the reconstituted formulation. The reconstituted formulation is suitable for administration (e.g. \n\n\nparenteral administration) to a patient to be treated with the anti-PAI-1 antibody and, in certain embodiments of the disclosure, may be one which is suitable for intravenous administration. \n\n\n[0541] The \"diluent\" of interest herein is one which is pharmaceutically acceptable (safe and non-toxic for administration to a human) and is useful for the preparation of a liquid formulation, such as a formulation reconstituted after lyophilization. In some embodiments, diluents include, but are not limited to, sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution. In an alternative embodiment, diluents can include aqueous solutions of salts and/or buffers. \n\n\n [0542] In certain embodiments, a formulation of the disclosure is a lyophilized formulation comprising an anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure, wherein at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% of said antibody may be recovered from a vial upon shaking said vial for 4 hours at a speed of 400 shakes per minute wherein said vial is filled to half of its volume with said formulation.

In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is stable at 4 °C. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is stable at room temperature. \n\n\n [0551] The terms \"stability\" and \"stable\" as used herein in the context of a formulation comprising an anti-PAI -1 antibody of the disclosure refer to the resistance of the antibody in the formulation to aggregation, degradation or fragmentation under given manufacture, preparation, transportation and storage conditions. The \"stable\" formulations of the disclosure retain biological activity under given manufacture, preparation, transportation and storage conditions. \n\n The stability of the anti-PAI-1 antibody can be assessed by degrees of aggregation, degradation or fragmentation, as measured by HPSEC, static light scattering (SLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), urea unfolding techniques, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry, and/or ANS binding techniques, compared to a reference formulation. For example, a reference formulation may be a reference standard frozen at -70°C consisting of 10 mg/ml of an anti-PAI -1 antibody of the disclosure in PBS. \n\n\n [0552] In specific embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions include, but are not limited to: \n\n\n (a) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 25 mM histidine, 1.6 mM glycine at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (b) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody and 25 mM histidine-HCl at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (c) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 25mg/ml of antibody, 20mM Citric acid, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5% mannitol, 50μ1 DTP A, and 0.02% Polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (d) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 25 mM histidine, 8% trehalose, and 0.02%> Polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (e) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 20 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM Histidine, 2.35 % (w/v) Lysine-HCl, and 0.02 % Polysorbate 80 (w/v) at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (f) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 5 mg/ml of antibody, lOmM Sodium citrate buffer, NaCl (0.15M) and Tween 80 (0.02%) at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (g) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM histidine and 150 mM NaCl at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (h) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 25 mM histidine, 1.6 mM glycine, 3% mannitol at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (i) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 10 mg/ml or 100 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM histidine-HCl, 105 mM NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (j) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM histidine-HCl, 0.005% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (k) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 6% trehalose, 2% arginine, 0.025%) polysorbate, 10m M histidine at pH 6.0; \n\n (1) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 20 mM citric acid, 200 mM lysine, 15% trehalose, 0.1% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (m) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 20 mM citric acid, 199 mM NaCl, 1.5% mannitol, 50μ1 DTP A, 0.02% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0 \n\n\n[0553] The liquid formulations of the present disclosure exhibit stability at the temperature ranges of 38 °C to 42 °C for at least 60 days and, in some embodiments, not more than 120 days, of 20 °C to 24 °C for at least 1 year, of 2 °C to 8 °C (in particular, at 4 °C) for at least 3 years, at least 4 years, or at least 5 years and at -20 °C for at least 3 years, at least 4 years, or at least 5 years, as assessed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC).

Preferably, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%, no more than 1%, and most preferably no more than 0.5%, of anti-PAI-1 antibody forms an aggregate as measured by HPSEC, after the storage for the defined periods as set forth above. Furthermore, liquid formulations of the present disclosure exhibit almost no loss in biological activity(ies) of anti-PAI-1 antibodies during the prolonged storage under the condition described above, as assessed by various immunological assays including, for example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay to measure the PAI-1 antigen-binding ability of anti-PAI-1 antibody. The liquid formulations of the present disclosure retain after the storage for the above-defined periods more than 80%, more than 85%, more than 90%, more than 95%, more than 98%, more than 99%, or more than 99.5% of the initial biological activity (ies) prior to the storage. \n\n\n [0554] Therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure may be formulated for a particular dosage. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required \n\n pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the disclosure are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the anti-PAI-1 antibody and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an anti-PAI-1 antibody for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. \n\n\n[0555] Therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure can be formulated for particular routes of administration, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a therapeutic effect. By way of example, in certain embodiments, the antibodies (including antibody fragments) are formulated for intravenous administration. In certain other embodiments, the antibodies (including antibody fragments) are formulated for local delivery to the cardiovascular system, for example, via catheter, stent, wire, \n\n\nintramyocardial delivery, intrapericardial delivery, or intraendocardial delivery. \n\n\n[0556] Formulations of the present disclosure which are suitable for topical or transdermal administration include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required (US Patent No. 7,378,110; 7,258,873; 7,135,180; US Publication No. 2004-0042972; and 2004-0042971). \n\n\n [0557] The phrases \"parenteral administration\" and \"administered parenterally\" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. \n\n\n [0558] Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which \n\n is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present disclosure employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. \n\n\n [0559] In certain embodiments, antibodies of the disclosure can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the disclosure can cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (1989) J. Clin. Pharmacol. 29:685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016); mannosides (Umezawa et al, (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n\n\n153: 1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 357: 140; M. Owais et al. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39: 180); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al. (1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233:134), different species of which may comprise the formulations of the disclosure s, as well as components of the invented molecules; pl20 (Schreier et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:9090); see also K. Keinanen; M. L. Laukkanen (1994) FEBS Lett. 346: 123; J. J. KiUion; I. J. Fidler (1994) Immunomethods 4:273. In one embodiment of the disclosure, the therapeutic compounds of the disclosure are formulated in liposomes; in another embodiment, the liposomes include a targeting moiety. In another embodiment, the therapeutic compounds in the liposomes are delivered by bolus injection to a site proximal to the desired area. When administered in this manner, the composition must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and may be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Additionally or \n\n alternatively, the antibodies of the disclosure may be delivered locally to the brain to mitigate the risk that the blood brain barrier slows effective delivery. \n\n\n [0560] In certain embodiments, the therapeutic antibody compositions may be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in certain embodiments an antibody or antibody fragment is administered locally via a catheter, stent, wire, or the like. For example, in one embodiment, a therapeutic composition of the disclosure can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,163; 5,383,851; 5,312,335; 5,064,413; 4,941,880; 4,790,824; 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present disclosure include: U.S. Pat. No. \n\n\n4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n[0561] The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the antibodies of the disclosure depend on the disease or condition to be treated and can be determined by the persons skilled in the art. \n\n\n [0562] A \"therapeutically effective dosage\" for treating cardiovascular disease may, for example, decrease the risk of infarction or stroke, may improve cardiac function, may decrease reliance on anticoagulation therapy, may decrease anginic pain, may decrease pain associated with thrombosis, etc. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected. \n\n\n G. Articles of Manufacture and Kits \n\n\n [0563] This section of the specification describes various exemplary kits and packages comprising anti-PAI-1 antibodies (including antibody fragments) of the present disclosure. It should be understood that any of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments described herein, including antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the structural and \n\n functional features described in detail throughout the application, may be packaged, sold, and/or used as part of a kit or package, as described in this section. When various kits and packages are described in this section as including an antibody, it is understood that such an antibody may be an antibody or an antibody fragment having any one or more of the characteristics of the anti- PAI-1 antibodies and antibody fragments described herein. The disclosure contemplates all combinations of any of the aspects and embodiments of the disclosure. \n\n\n[0564] The disclosure provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with a liquid formulation or lyophilized formulation of the disclosure (e.g., a formulation comprising an anti-PAI-1 antibody or antibody fragment of the present disclosure). In one embodiment, a container filled with a liquid formulation of the disclosure is a pre-filled syringe. In one embodiment, the formulations of the disclosure comprise anti- PAI-1 antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated to another moiety, including but not limited to, a heterologous protein, a heterologous polypeptide, a heterologous peptide, a large molecule, a small molecule, a marker sequence, a diagnostic or detectable agent, a therapeutic moiety, a drug moiety, a radioactive metal ion, a second antibody, and a solid support. In a specific \n\n\nembodiment, the formulations of the disclosure are formulated in single dose vials as a sterile liquid. The formulations of the disclosure may be supplied in 3 cc USP Type I borosilicate amber vials (West Pharmaceutical Services - Part No. 6800-0675) with a target volume of 1.2 mL. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. In another embodiment, a formulation of the disclosure may be supplied in a pre-filled syringe. \n\n\n [0565] In one embodiment, a container filled with a liquid formulation of the disclosure is a pre-filled syringe. Any pre-filled syringe known to one of skill in the art may be used in combination with a liquid formulation of the disclosure. Pre-filled syringes that may be used are described in, for example, but not limited to, PCT Publications WO05032627, WO08094984, W09945985, WO03077976, US Patents US6792743, US5607400, US5893842, US7081107, US7041087, US5989227, US6807797, US6142976, US5899889, US Patent Publications US20070161961A1, US20050075611A1, US20070092487A1, US20040267194A1, \n\n\nUS20060129108A1. Pre-filled syringes may be made of various materials. In one embodiment \n\n a pre-filled syringe is a glass syringe. In another embodiment a pre-filled syringe is a plastic syringe. One of skill in the art understands that the nature and/or quality of the materials used for manufacturing the syringe may influence the stability of a protein formulation stored in the syringe. For example, it is understood that silicon based lubricants deposited on the inside surface of the syringe chamber may affect particle formation in the protein formulation. In one embodiment, a pre-filled syringe comprises a silicone based lubricant. In one embodiment, a pre-filled syringe comprises baked on silicone. In another embodiment, a pre-filled syringe is free from silicone based lubricants. One of skill in the art also understands that small amounts of contaminating elements leaching into the formulation from the syringe barrel, syringe tip cap, plunger or stopper may also influence stability of the formulation. For example, it is understood that tungsten introduced during the manufacturing process may adversely affect formulation stability. In one embodiment, a pre-filled syringe may comprise tungsten at a level above 500 ppb. In another embodiment, a pre-filled syringe is a low tungsten syringe. In another embodiment, a pre-filled syringe may comprise tungsten at a level between about 500 ppb and about 10 ppb, between about 400 ppb and about 10 ppb, between about 300 ppb and about 10 ppb, between about 200 ppb and about 10 ppb, between about 100 ppb and about 10 ppb, between about 50 ppb and about 10 ppb, between about 25 ppb and about 10 ppb. \n\n\n[0566] In certain embodiments, kits comprising anti-PAI-1 antibodies are also provided that are useful for various purposes, e.g., research and diagnostic including for purification or immunoprecipitation of PAI-1 from cells, detection of PAI-1 in vitro or in vivo, etc. For isolation and purification of PAI-1, the kit may contain an anti-PAI-1 antibody coupled to beads (e.g., sepharose beads). Kits may be provided which contain the antibodies for detection and quantitation of PAI-1 in vitro, e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot. As with the article of manufacture, the kit comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. The container holds a composition comprising at least one anti-PAI-1 antibody of the disclosure. Additional containers may be included that contain, e.g., diluents and buffers, control antibodies. The label or package insert may provide a description of the composition as well as instructions for the intended in vitro or diagnostic use. \n\n\n [0567] The present disclosure also encompasses a finished packaged and labeled pharmaceutical product. This article of manufacture includes the appropriate unit dosage form in an appropriate vessel or container such as a glass vial, pre-filled syringe or other container that is \n\n hermetically sealed. In one embodiment, the unit dosage form is provided as a sterile particulate free solution comprising an anti-PAI-1 antibody that is suitable for parenteral administration. In another embodiment, the unit dosage form is provided as a sterile lyophilized powder comprising an anti- PAI-1 antibody that is suitable for reconstitution. \n\n\n [0568] In one embodiment, the unit dosage form is suitable for intravenous, \n\n\nintramuscular, intranasal, oral, topical or subcutaneous delivery. Thus, the disclosure encompasses sterile solutions suitable for each delivery route. The disclosure further encompasses sterile lyophilized powders that are suitable for reconstitution. \n\n\n[0569] As with any pharmaceutical product, the packaging material and container are designed to protect the stability of the product during storage and shipment. Further, the products of the disclosure include instructions for use or other informational material that advise the physician, technician or patient on how to appropriately prevent or treat the disease or disorder in question, as well as how and how frequently to administer the pharmaceutical. In other words, the article of manufacture includes instruction means indicating or suggesting a dosing regimen including, but not limited to, actual doses, monitoring procedures, and other monitoring information. \n\n\n [0570] Specifically, the disclosure provides an article of manufacture comprising packaging material, such as a box, bottle, tube, vial, container, pre-filled syringe, sprayer, insufflator, intravenous (i.v.) bag, envelope and the like; and at least one unit dosage form of a pharmaceutical agent contained within said packaging material, wherein said pharmaceutical agent comprises a liquid formulation containing an antibody. The packaging material includes instruction means which indicate how that said antibody can be used to prevent, treat and/or manage one or more symptoms associated with a disease or disorder. \n\n\nEXAMPLES \n\n\n [0571] The examples illustrate various aspects of the disclosure and practice of the methods of the disclosure using reagents that are commercially available or can be prepared using commercially available instrumentation, methods, or reagents known in the art. The examples are not intended to provide an exhaustive description of the many different \n\n\nembodiments of the disclosure. Thus, although the disclosure has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, those of ordinary \n\n skill in the art will realize readily that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims. The examples are not intended to limit or define the entire scope of this disclosure. \n\n\nExample 1. Characterization of Anti-PAI-1 Antibodies \n\n\n [0572] This example describes the characterization of various anti-PAI-1 antibodies. The suitable characteristics for such antibodies were: potent human, cynomolgus and rat PAI-1 neutralizing activity in a functional assay, selectivity for human PAI-1 over other circulating serpins, selectivity for active PAI-1 over latent, lack of inhibition of PAI-1 binding to vitronectin and confirmed species cross reactivity by competition ELISA. \n\n\n [0573] Cynomolgus cross reactivity will enable safety studies to be carried out using cynomolgus monkey. Functional cross-reactivity against rat PAI-1 permits demonstration of efficacy in rodent disease models. Selectivity for PAI-1 over other circulating serpins, and lack of inhibition of PAI-1 binding to vitronectin, is desired in order to minimise any potential safety risks related to disruption of the varied functions associated with other serpin family members, and inhibition of other vitronectin-mediated functions for which PAI-1 has been implicated (for example, regulation of cell binding and cell migration). Selectivity for active PAI-1 over latent (inactive) avoids the sink of latent PAI-1 thought to represent the majority of circulating antigen (ti/2 for the irreversible active to latent transition is approximately 2 hours \n\n\n [0574] A functional biochemical assay (chromogenic assay) was established in which the activity of human tPA in the presence of both human PAI-1 and anti-PAI-1 scFvs is detected by the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate. Assay formats included a part-rat version in which the activity of rat tPA in the presence of both rat PAI-1 and the purified scFv was measured, and a part-cynomolgus version in which the inhibition of the activity of cynomolgus PAI-1 on human tPA was measured. \n\n\n [0575] To determine the effect of scFv on binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin, a DELFIA format competition assay involving human PAI-1 binding to immobilized human monomeric vitronectin was performed. \n\n\n A. Screening \n\n\n [0576] scFvs were tested in the human, cyno, rat and mouse cell-free chromogenic assays as described herein. Examples of data on IC50 of antibodies 1 to 27 are shown in Table 3. \n\n\nSequence information for the CDRs of antibodies 1 to 27, as well as the VH and VL, are \n\n provided in the Sequence Listing and tables. Data for two representative clones (Antibody 08 and Antibody 16) are shown in Figure 2. IC\n50\n values measured for Antibody 08 scFv in human (Figure 2a) and cyno (Figure 2b) assays were 3.6 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. IC\n50\n values for Antibody 16 scFv in the human (Figure 2a) and cyno (Figure 2b) assays under the chosen conditions were 3.6 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. As shown in Figures 2c and 2d, IC\n50\n values in the rat and mouse assays were 3 nM and 2.6 nM, respectively, for Antibody 08 and 5.6 nM and 4.3 nM, respectively, for Antibody 16. Therefore, clones were equipotent on all species variants. \n\n\n[0577] The above findings were confirmed with whole antibodies. The scFvs were converted to IgG and purified before testing again in cell-free chromogenic assays. The IgG IC\n50\n values were very similar to values for the corresponding scFv, e.g., Antibody 08 had IC\n50\n of 1.9 nM in the human assay, 0.8 nM in the cyno assay, 2 nM in the rat assay and 1.2 nM in the mouse assay. \n\n\n [0578] In addition, the clones were tested in a dog cell-free chromogenic assay. The IC\n50\n for an IgG tested in this assay was 12.1 nM (i.e., within 10-fold ratio to potency on human PAI- 1). \n\n\n [0579] Further, the clones were tested on glycosylated active human PAI-1 produced by\n\n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Stromqvist, M., et al. Protein Expr Purif, 1994. 5: p. 309). Exemplified by IC\n50\ns of 1.7 nM for Antibody 1, 1.5 nM for Antibody 2, 1.3 nM for Antibody 08, 1.2 nM for Antibody 16, 1.3 nM for Antibody 20, and 2.6 nM for Antibody 27 (see Table 4), the potencies were nearly identical to those measured on the previously used bacterially-derived PAI-1 and therefore did not suggest any dependency on the glycosylation state of the molecule. \n\n\n[0580] Most of the selected scFv and IgG have an IC\n50\n in the human chromogenic assay of <10 nM. \n\n\n [0581] The variable heavy chains and the variable light chains of the antibodies shown in\n\n\nTable 3 were sequenced to determine their DNA sequences, and a lineup of the CDR sequences for antibodies 1-27 is depicted in Table 2. The complete sequence information for these anti- PAI-1 antibodies is provided in the Sequence Listing with nucleotide and amino acid sequences in which SEQ ID NOs correspond as shown in Table 16. \n\n Example 2. Neutralisation potency of anti-PAI-1 antibodies in the HT-1080 plasminogen activation assay with exogenous human, rat and mouse PAI-1 \n\n\n [0582] Select scFVs were tested as IgG in the HT-1080 plasminogen activation assay.\n\n\nUsing an adapted method of Osada et al. (1991), HT-1080 cells were plated (~20000/well, 96 well format) and cultured for 20-24 h. The media was then aspirated, and cell monolayers were incubated with antibody in the presence of the chromogenic plasmin substrate S-2251 (0.2mM) and 5 μg ml\n\"1\n Lys-plasminogen in 200 μΐ of HBSS at 37°C. The increase in absorbance at\n\n\n405nm was then followed for up to 3h. 15 nM rat or mouse PAI-1 (US Biological) instead of the human reagent were used to confirm cross-reactivity of the clones in this assay. Examples of data on IC50 (nM) of selected antibodies are shown in Table 5. \n\n\n [0583] The HT-1080 assay was also used to assess the potency of germlined versions of the scFv clones. The amino acid sequences of their VHs and VLs were aligned to the known human germline sequences in the VBASE database (Tomlinson, I., VBASE. 1997, MRC Centre of Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK), and the closest germline was identified by sequence similarity. For the VH domains, this corresponds to VH1-69 (DP-10), and for VL, Vkappal LI 2. There were between 1 and 5 changes in the frameworks of the VH domains and between 5 and 6 in the VL domains, all of which were reverted to the closest germline sequence by site- directed mutagenesis to match human antibodies. Only the Vernier residues (Foote, J., et al. J Mol Biol, 1992. 224: p. 487) mutated during the optimisation process were left unchanged. The resulting IgGs were retested in the human and rat HT-1080 plasminogen activation assays, and the potencies for the two versions of each clone were demonstrated to be very similar. A representative scFV gave results with IC50 values of 7.4 nM for the non-germlined and 11.3 nM for the germlined variant. In addition, the potency of this clone in the rat assay was unaffected by the germlining. The IC50S for non-germlined and germlined IgG were 17.3 nM and 19.6 nM, respectively. Therefore, none of the germline framework mutations in the VH and VL domains of these antibodies are essential for their potency on human or rodent PAI-1, and all could be reverted to the closest germline. \n\n\n Example 3. Neutralisation potency of anti-PAI-1 antibodies in the human and mouse plasminogen activation assays with endogenous PAI-1 \n\n\n [0584] In the plasminogen activation assays described in Example 2, recombinant PAI-1 from different species was added to HT-1080 cells at a defined concentration. This allowed comparative potency determination of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies on human and rodent PAI-1. In \n\n addition, it was also shown in the chromogenic assay that the antibodies inhibited glycosylated active human PAI-1 from eukaryotic cells as well as the bacterially derived molecule with similar IC\n50\nS (see Example 1). In order to confirm all this data on native PAI-1, the scFV antibodies (Table 16) were tested in plasminogen activation assays on endogenous rather than added recombinant PAI-1. To this end, transforming growth factor βι (TGFPi) was used to induce PAI-1 production in the human HT-1080 and Normal Human Lung Fibroblast (NHLF, Clonetics/Biowhittaker) as well as mouse fibroblast MLg (ECACC) cells. The protocol of the HT-1080 plasminogen activation assay was as described below and as used in Example 2, but with the following exceptions: NHLF cells were seeded at lxlO\n4\n cells/well in 96-well flat- bottomed tissue culture assay plates (Costar), MLg cells at 2xl0\n4\n cells/well in 96-well flat- bottomed collagen I-coated tissue culture assay plates (Becton Dickinson). PAI-1 production was induced by culturing the cells for 20 hours in the presence of 100 pM recombinant human TGFPi (R&D Systems). \n\n\n [0585] In the HT-1080 assay, representative antibody had an IC\n50\n of 1.4 nM. The potency was further confirmed in the more disease-relevant fibroblast cell line NHLF. The IC\n50\n for a representative antibody was 3.7 nM. Finally, the functional cross-reactivity of the scFV clones shown on recombinant mouse PAI-1 added to human HT-1080 cells was confirmed in the MLg assay releasing both mouse uPA/tPA and mouse PAI-1. A representative antibody, for example, inhibited with an IC\n50\n of 0.6 nM. \n\n\nExample 4. Characterization of PICK167 A01 \n\n\n [0586] This example details the characterization of one antibody, PICK167 A01. \n\n\n PICK167 A01 scFv inhibited the action of human and cynomolgus PAI-1 (both 5.0nM) on human tPA (2.14nM) with IC\n50\n values of 3.20nM and 1.02nM, respectively. PICK167 A01 scFv inhibited the action of rat PAI-1 (2.0nM) on rat tPA (1.34nM) with IC\n50\n 2.98nM. Example IC\n50\n data for PICK167 A01 scFv in each of these assays is shown in Figure 3. \n\n\n[0587] Additionally, PICK167 A01 scFv neutralized ΙΟηΜ human, 15nM mouse and\n\n\n15nM rat PAI-1 in a cell-based HT1080 plasminogen activation assay (see Figure 4), with the pICso\ns\n of 7.65 ± 0.04 (22nM), 7.60 ± 0.048 (25nM) and 7.31± 0.04 (49nM) respectively. \n\n PICK167 A01 Sequence and Conversion to Igd \n\n\n10 20 30 40 50\n\n\nCCGGCCATGGCCCAGGTACAGCTGCAGCAGTCAGGGGCTGAAGTGAAGAA GGCCGGTACCGGGTCCATGTCGACGTCGTCAGTCCCCGACTTCACTTCTT P A M A Q V Q L Q Q S G A E V K K> TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n60 70 80 90 100\n\n\nGCCTGGCTCTTCGGTGAAGGTCTCCTGCAAGGCTTCTGGAGGCACCTTCA CGGACCGAGAAGCCACTTCCAGAGGACGTTCCGAAGACCTCCGTGGAAGT P G S S V K V S C K A S G G T F>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n110 120 130 140 150\n\n\nGCAGCTACGCTATCAGCTGGGTGCGACAGGCCCCTGGACAAAGGCTTGAG CGTCGATGCGATAGTCGACCCACGCTGTCCGGGGACCTGTTTCCGAACTC S S Y A I S W V R Q A P G Q R L E>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n160 170 180 190 200\n\n\nTGGATGGGAGGGATCATCCCTACTTTTGGTACAGCAAACTACGCTCAGAA ACCTACCCTCCCTAGTAGGGATGAAAACCATGTCGTTTGATGCGAGTCTT W M G G I I P T F G T A N Y A Q K> TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n210 220 230 240 250\n\n\nGTTCCAGGGCAGAGTCACGATTACCGCGGACGAATCCACGAGCACAGCCT CAAGGTCCCGTCTCAGTGCTAATGGCGCCTGCTTAGGTGCTCGTGTCGGA F Q G R V T I T A D E S T S T A>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n 260 270 280 290 300\n\n\nACATGGAGCTGAGCGGCCTGAGGTCTGAGGACACGGCCGTCTATTACTGT TGTACCTCGACTCGCCGGACTCCAGACTCCTGTGCCGGCAGATAATGACA Y M E L S G L R S E D T A V Y Y C> \n\n\n TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n310 320 330 340 350\n\n\nGCGAGAGAGAGGAGGCAGTGGCTGGAAGGACACTTTGACTACTGGGGCCG CGCTCTCTCTCCTCCGTCACCGACCTTCCTGTGAAACTGATGACCCCGGC A R E R R Q W L E G H F D Y W G R> TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n360 370 380 390 400\n\n\nGGGCACCCCGGTCACCGTCTCGAGTGGTGGAGGCGGCTCTGGCGGAGGTG CCCGTGGGGCCAGTGGCAGAGCTCACCACCTCCGCCGAGACCGCCTCCAC G T P V T V S S G G G G S G G G>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n410 420 430 440 450\n\n\nGCAGCGGCGGTGGCGGATCGGACATCCAGATGACCCAGTCCCCATCCTTC CGTCGCCGCCACCGCCTAGCCTGTAGGTCTACTGGGTCAGGGGTAGGAAG G S G G G G S D I Q M T Q S P S F> \n\n\n TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n460 470 480 490 500\n\n\nCTGTCTGCATCTATTGGAGACAGAGTCACCATCACCTGCCGGGCCAGTGA GACAGACGTAGATAACCTCTGTCTCAGTGGTAGTGGACGGCCCGGTCACT L S A S I G D R V T I T C R A S E> TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n 510 520 530 540 550\n\n\nGGGTATTTATCACAACTTGGCCTGGTATCAGCAGAAGCCAGGGAAAGCCC CCCATAAATAGTGTTGAACCGGACCATAGTCGTCTTCGGTCCCTTTCGGG G I Y H N L A W Y Q Q K P G K A>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n560 570 580 590 600\n\n\nCAAAACTCCTGATCTATAAGGCCTCTAGTTTAGCCAGTGGGGCCCCATCA GTTTTGAGGACTAGATATTCCGGAGATCAAATCGGTCACCCCGGGGTAGT P K L L I Y K A S S L A S G A P S>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n610 620 630 640 650\n\n\nAGGTTCAGCGGCAGTAGATCTGGGACAGATTTCACTCTCACCATCAGCAG TCCAAGTCGCCGTCATCTAGACCCTGTCTAAAGTGAGAGTGGTAGTCGTC R F S G S R S G T D F T L T I S S> TRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n660 670 680 690 700\n\n\nCCTGCAGCCTGATGATTTTGCGACTTATTACTGCCAACAATATAGTAATT GGACGTCGGACTACTAAAACGCTGAATAATGACGGTTGTTATATCATTAA L Q P D D F A T Y Y C Q Q Y S N>\n\n\nTRANSLATION OF PICK167 A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n\n710 720 730 740 ATCCACTTACTTTCGGCGGAGGGACCAAGCTGGAGATCAAACGTGCG TAGGTGAATGAAAGCCGCCTCCCTGGTTCGACCTCTAGTTTGCACGC Y P L T F G G G T K L E I K R A> TRANSLATION OF PICK167_A01.DNA.MCV [A] > \n\n [0588] PICK167 A01 scFv was converted to Igd by sub-cloning the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains into vectors expressing whole human antibody heavy and light chains respectively. The variable heavy chain was cloned into the pEU15.1 vector containing the human heavy chain constant domains and regulatory elements to express whole IgGi heavy chain in mammalian cells. Similarly, the variable light chain domain was cloned into the pEU3.4 vector for the expression of the human light chain (kappa) constant domains and regulatory elements to express whole IgG light chain in mammalian cells (Persic et al 1997). To obtain the PICK167 A01 antibody as IgGi, the heavy and light chain IgG expressing vectors were transiently transfected into EBNA-HEK293 mammalian cells and secreted into the medium. Harvests were pooled and filtered prior to purification, and PICK167 A01 antibody was purified using Protein A chromatography. \n\n\nB. Specificity of PICK167_A01 Igd \n\n\n [0589] PICK167 A01 IgGi cross-reactivity to rat, murine, rabbit and latent PAI-1, and specificity for PAI-1 above a panel of structurally related serpins, was assessed. Briefly, PICK167 A01 IgGi was coated onto wells of a Maxisorp plate. Binding of biotinylated PAI-1 in the presence of a titration of test antigen was detected by the addition of Streptavidin-Eu\n3+\n using the DELFIA system (Perkin Elmer). Data were transferred to Prism where a one-site binding analysis was carried out. Results are shown in Figure 5 (a) and (b). Functional cross reactivity to rat PAI-1 is also shown in Figure 6. \n\n\n [0590] PICK167 A01 demonstrates a 10-fold loss of binding affinity for latent PAI-1 compared to wild-type 'active' PAI-1 (labelled as 'human' throughout the figures below) (Figure 5 (a)). PICK167 A01 does not bind to a panel of other human serpins when tested by this method (Figure 5 (b)). PICK167 A01 did not inhibit binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin in a biochemical assay in either scFv or IgGi formats. \n\n\nC. In vitro potency of PICK167_A01 Igd \n\n\n [0591] PICK167 A01 IgGi was then further characterized in secondary functional assays in which the activity of tPA in the presence of both PAI-1 and PICK167 A01 IgGi was measured. Human, cynomolgus and rat versions of this generic assay format were used to confirm human potency and functional cross-reactivity. PICK167 A01 IgGi inhibited the action of human and cynomolgus PAI-1 (both 5.0nM) on human tPA (2.14nM) with IC\n50\n values of 1.34 \n\n +/- 0.15nM and 0.80 +/- 0.3 InM, respectively. PICK167 A01 Igd inhibited the action of rat PAI-1 (2.0nM) on rat tPA (1.34nM) with IC\n50\n 1.97 +/- 0.77nM. Example IC\n50\n data for \n\n\nPICK167 A01 IgGi in each of these assays is shown in Figure 6. \n\n\n D. Reversion to germline and conversion to IgGl \n\n\n [0592] The amino acid sequences of the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains of PICK167 A01 were compared to the known human germline sequences in the VBASE database (Tomlinson 1997), and the closest germline identified by sequence similarity. The closest human germline sequences for the heavy and light chains were found to be VH 1-69 (DP 10) and VK LI 2a respectively. An alignment of PICK167 A01 to these, and closest matching J regions, is shown in Figure 15 with differences between PICK167 A01 and germline sequences highlighted. \n\n\n[0593] Vernier residues (Foote and Winter, 1992) that remained unmutated are indicated in grey. \n\n\n [0594] Without considering the Vernier residues, there were four changes made in the light chain and five made in the heavy chain. Mutagenesis was by the method of Kunkel (Sidhu and Weiss, 1990), adapted for mutagenesis in the IgG vectors containing the separate VH and VL domains of PICK167 A01 as template. This resulted in the creation of the fully-germlined variant, PICK167_A01-fgl (CAT-1001) as an Igd only. The sequences of PICK167_A01-fgl DNA and deduced amino acid sequence are shown below. \n\n\n 1.

Briefly, PICK167_A01-fgl IgGi was coated onto wells of a Maxisorp plate.

Human, cynomolgus and rat versions of this generic assay format were again used to confirm both human potency and also functional cross-reactivity. CAT-1001 (PICKl 67 A01 -fgl IgGi) inhibited the action of human and cynomolgus PAI-1 (both 5.0nM) on human tPA (2.14nM) with IC\n50\n values of 1.65nM and 0.77nM, respectively.

Identification of essential point mutations for potency on rodent PAI-1 by site- directed mutagenesis and cell-free chromogenic assays \n\n\n [0601] In an attempt to identify which amino acid substitutions in the VH and VL domains of the antibodies were responsible for the significant potency measured for some of the variants tested above, the sequences of all scFvs with IC50S within a 1000-fold ratio in the human and rat chromogenic assays were aligned and compared. Most of them were altered in two mutation hot-spots in VHCDR2 and VLCDR1. For certain antibodies, the glycine for aspartic acid substitution was predominant at position 55 of VH. The amino acid residue at position 32 of VL however was mutated more often to asparagine and glutamic acid. \n\n\n[0602] In addition to these hot-spots, two other important amino acid changes were revealed. Lysine at position 50 in VLCDR2 was changed to arginine in many clones and glycine at the Vernier framework position 66 of VL (Foote, J., et al. J Mol Biol, 1992. 224: p. 487) was replaced by arginine in variants with IC50S in the human and rodent cell-free chromogenic assays within a 2-fold ratio. \n\n\n [0603] To substantiate the latter observation, the following mutational analyses were carried out on cDNA encoding the scFv (Stratagene QuikChange\n®\n kit). Antibody 08, equipotent in human, cyno and rodent cell-free chromogenic assays (see Example 1), was mutated to reverse the engineered arginine 66 to glycine. The resulting variant Antibody 08-R66KO scFv was then retested in the chromogenic assays. Its IC\n50\n in the human assay was essentially unchanged, with an IC\n50\n of 4.3 11M as compared with 3.2 11M for Antibody 08 (Figure 10a). The IC\n50\n in the rat \n\n assay however increased about 300-fold to 920 nM for the mutated variant compared with 3 nM for the non-mutated Antibody 08 scFv (15b). \n\n\n [0604] The importance of this arginine 66 of VL for cross-reactivity was further confirmed by introducing it into PICKl 17B05 and Antibody 18, which both still contained glycine at this position. Prior to mutation these scFv had IC\n50\n values in the human assay of 0.8 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively (Figure 10c). In the rat assay however, PICKl 17B05 scFv gave an approximately 1000-fold higher IC\n50\n value of greater than 1 μΜ and Antibody 18 scFv gave an approximately 180-fold higher IC\n50\n value of 240 nM when compared with data from the human assay (Figure lOd). After introduction of arginine for glycine at position 66 of their VLs, the potencies remained the same in the human assay. The IC\n50\nS were 2.7 nM for PICKl 17B05- R66KI and 4.5 nM for Antibody 18-R66KI. The substitution however had a beneficial effect on their inhibitory activity on rat PAI-1, with the respective IC\n50\nS dropping over 10-fold to 220 nM for PICKl 17B05-R66KI and over 5-fold to 63 nM for Antibody 18-R66KI, resulting in human to rat IC\n50\n ratios of about 80- and 14-fold, respectively. \n\n\n Example 7. Affinity of anti-PAI-1 antibodies for human and rat PAI-1 as determined by BIAcore \n\n\n [0605] The cross-reactivity of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies to human and rodent PAI-1 was further confirmed by affinity determination. Surface plasmon resonance measurements using a BIAcore 2000 Biosensor (BIAcore AB) were performed essentially as described by Karlsson et al. (Karlsson, R., et al. J Immunol Methods, 1991. 145: p. 229). In brief, antibodies were coupled to CM5 sensorchips using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore) at a surface density of approximately 500 RU and a serial dilution (between 25 nM and 400 pM) of human and rat PAI- 1 (both Molecular Innovations) in Hepes Buffered Saline/lmg bovine serum albumin was passed over the sensorchip surface. The resulting sensorgrams were evaluated using BIA evaluation 3.1 software to provide kinetic data. \n\n\n [0606] The dissociation constants (KD) for the tested anti-PAI-1 IgGs under the chosen conditions were between 10 pM and 120 pM on active human PAI-1. The on-rates (ton) were in the range of 2.2x106 M-ls-1 and 1.3x106 M-ls-1, the off-rates (toff) were between 1.5x10-4 s-1 and 2.3x10-5 s-1. The affinities on active rat PAI-1 were within about a 10-fold ratio to human for each antibody. The KDs were between 110 and 300 pM with tons ranging from 1x106 M-ls- \n\n 1 to 2.5x106 M-ls-1 and k\n0\na from 2.1xl0\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n to 7.2xl0\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n. These values confirmed the cross- reactivity of the antibody molecules to human and rat PAI-1. \n\n\n [0607] In a further experiment, the affinity of the anti-PAI-1 antibody, Antibody 08 to human glycosylated PAI-1, human stable mutant PAI-1, cyno PAI-1 and rat PAI-1 was determined by BIAcore. Surface plasmon resonance analysis using a BIAcore T100 Biosensor (GE Healthcare) was performed using a modification of experimental conditions described above. Antibody 08 was coupled to CM3 sensorchip using amine coupling at approximate surface densities of 100 and 500 RU and a serial dilution (between 6.25 nM and 50 pM) of glycosylated human, stable mutant human, rat PAI-1 (all Molecular Innovations) and cyno (recombinantly expressed in-house and purified from E. coli) in HBS-EP+ (Biacore) was passed over the sensorchip surface. The sample was injected for 120s at 30 ul/min (or higher) and the dissociation period monitored for 800s per cycle. Stable regeneration of the chip surface was achieved by paired injections of lOmM Glycine pH2. Affinity determination was performed at both 25 °C and 37 °C. The resulting sensorgrams were double reference-subtracted against a buffer blank and evaluated using BIA evaluation software to provide kinetic data by fitting to a 1 : 1 Langmuir model. Fits were assessed for quality and evidence of mass transport limitation using the returned fitting parameters & residuals. \n\n\n [0608] A very high affinity interaction was observed with on-rates (k\non\n) of approximately lxlO\n6\n M\n'\nV\n1\n and off-rates (k\n0ff\n) of approximately lxlO\n'\nV\n1\n. Antibody 08 consistently showed an affinity of less than 20 pM for human and cyno PAI-1. No significant difference in the mean of multiple kinetic results was observed between 25 °C (Table 6a) and 37 °C (Table 6b). \n\n\n Example 8. Cross-reactivity of anti-PAI-1 antibodies to active PAI-1 species variants and selectivity over latent human PAI-1 and other SERPINs as measured by competition binding assay \n\n\n [0609] The relative cross-reactivity of the anti-human PAI-1 antibody molecules to the various PAI-1 species variants identified in the functional chromogenic and plasminogen activation assays (see Examples 1 and 3) was further assessed biochemically by competition binding assays. IgG binding to active human PAI-1 was tested against mouse, rat and, rabbit PAI-1 using the competition binding assay. \n\n\n [0610] As shown in Figure 11a, Antibody 16, for example, bound to rat PAI-1 with an apparent affinity of only 4.8-fold lower than for human under these conditions. The ratios to mouse and rabbit were 14.4 and 7.9, respectively. The binding to latent PAI-1 was about 11-fold \n\n weaker and the binding to glycosylated PAI-1 produced in house by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Stromqvist, M., et al, 1994, supra) was within about 2-fold of binding to bacterially-derived antigen. In general, the data from the previous examples was confirmed for all tested clones. \n\n\n [0611] Data obtained in the competition binding assay are summarised in Table 7, which shows ratios of IC50S of selected antibodies in respect of glycosylated active human PAI-1, latent human PAI-1, rat PAI-1, mouse PAI-1 and rabbit PAI-1 as compared with non-glycosylated active human PAI-1 (\"wt\"). These values thus represent fold differences in potency of the binding members for neutralising these PAI-1 molecules as compared with potency for neutralising non-glycosylated active human PAI-1. In addition, the PAI-1 neutralising antibodies were assessed for their selectivity for active human PAI-1 over other related SERPINs using the same assay. As shown in Figure 1 lb for Antibody 16, no binding could be detected to PAI-2 and PAI-3 (both MRC Cambridge), antithrombin III and a 1 -antitrypsin (US Biological), l-antichymotrypsin (Research Diagnostics) and a2-antiplasmin (American Diagnostica) under the chosen assay conditions. \n\n\n Example 9. Inhibition of PAI-l:tPA complex formation by anti-PAI-1 antibodies as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis \n\n\n [0612] Incubation of tPA with active PAI-1 leads to the formation of a covalent PAI-\n\n\n1 :tPA complex upon the formation of an ester bond between the active site serine of tPA and the PI residue of the PAI-1 reactive centre loop (Gils, A., et al. Thromb Haemost, 2003. 90: p. 206). This covalent complex can be demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis as a higher molecular weight band compared with PAI-1 and tPA alone. The antibodies of the disclosure can be shown to inhibit the formation of the complex by using this method. Both, E. co/z-derived as well as CHO-derived, and thus glycosylated, active human PAI-1 could be prevented from binding to tPA by the presence of IgG as demonstrated by the absence of the higher molecular weight band. No enhanced formation of a cleaved and thus lower molecular weight form of PAI-1 was observed following antibody incubations, indicating that these antibodies do not act by inducing a substrate conformation. On the contrary, the data supports a mechanism of inhibition involving prevention of the formation of the Michaelis-Menten complex. \n\n Example 10. PEPSCAN-based peptide scan \n\n\n [0613] A candidate IgG antibody molecule selected from antibodies 1 to 27 was screened against 3310 peptides representing both linear overlapping peptides and a large number of conformationally restrained peptides representing short regions of amino acid sequence derived from the human PAI-1 sequence SEQ ID NO: 124. The synthetic peptides were covalently coupled to a solid phase credit card format to allow screening of antibody binding. Binding of the IgG was detected by incubation with an anti-human antibody peroxidase conjugate using 2,2'-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide as the colorimetric detection reagents. The antibody was tested at two concentrations (0.01 μg/ml and 0.05 μg/ml). \n\n\n[0614] Analysis of the detection signals indicated that eight of the top 10 binding values obtained at the 0.01 μg/ml antibody concentration were derived from peptides containing the motif GHYYD. The eight are marked with * in Table 8. The GHYYD motif is located at amino acid residues 218-222 in the mature PAI-1 sequence SEQ ID NO: 124. \n\n\n [0615] The two peptides identified in the top ten binding signals which did not contain the GHYYD motif were not considered to be relevant as they correspond to sequences which would be found buried in the PAI-1 molecule and may therefore represent non-specific binding events. \n\n\n [0616] The peptide binding data was also analysed by calculating the average binding signal for all peptides analysed at the 0.01 μg/ml antibody concentration and for each peptide a signal/average background signal ratio was calculated. A ratio of 3 or greater was considered a positive signal. Table 9 shows all peptide sequences which gave a ratio of 3 or greater. The highest binding signal ratios were obtained for peptides containing the GHYYD motif within the context of a constrained peptide. Additional peptides which gave ratios above three included motifs derived from both loops 204-210 and 267-273 (numbering according to the mature PAI-1 sequence SEQ ID NO: 124) with the highest ratio being derived from the peptide \n\n\nCQTNKFNYCTRLPRLLC (SEQ ID NO: 143). This peptide is indicated by * in Table 9. This result is consistent with the regions QTNKFNY (SEQ ID NO: 157) and TRLPRLL (SEQ ID NO: 158) also contributing to the epitope. \n\n Example 11. Mutagenesis of putative PAI-1 epitope regions and SDS-PAGE analysis of inhibition of PAI-l:tPA complex formation for mutant PAI-1 \n\n\n [0617] Using site-directed mutagenesis, the Arg corresponding to position 271 of mature human PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 124) was mutated to Ser, changing the motif TRLPRLL (SEQ ID NO: 158) to TRLPSLL (SEQ ID NO: 188). Mutagenesis was performed on a stable mutant form of human PAI-1 having sequence SEQ ID NO: 190 (Berkanpas, M.B., Lawrance, D.A. and Ginsburg, D. 1995. EMBO Journal, 14, 2969-2977), to form SEQ ID NO: 191 containing the Arg to Ser point mutation. Arg271 of mature human PAI-1 corresponds to Arg292 in SEQ ID NO: 190. \n\n\n [0618] SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described herein, except that the \n\n\n Arg292Ser mutant PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 191) was used. The mutant PAI-1 contains the point mutations Asnl50His, Lysl54Thr, Gln319Leu and Met354Ile (residue numbering per SEQ ID NO: 124) compared with mature human PAI-1. These mutations increase stability of the mutant form in the active conformation, so that it converts to the latent form more slowly than wild-type PAI-1. Use of the stable mutant may confer practical advantages in terms of handling of the proteins during the assay method. The mutant form also bears an N-terminal His tag. \n\n\n[0619] SDS-PAGE analysis of inhibition of the Arg to Ser mutant PAI- 1 :tPA complex formation indicated that the candidate antibody did not block complex formation. Data on affinity of antibody binding to Arg to Ser mutant PAI-1 were obtained using BIAcore, and indicated that affinity of a candidate antibody of for binding the mutant PAI-1 was lower than for binding wild-type human PAI-1. \n\n\n [0620] These data indicate that binding to the motif TRLPRLL (SEQ ID NO : 158) contributes to the mechanism of inhibition of the antibodies disclosed herein. The data further indicate that the Arg residue at position 271 of mature human PAI-1 is structurally important for antibody :antigen recognition, suggesting that binding members of the disclosure may bind R271 of mature human PAI-1. \n\n\n Example 12. X-ray crystal structure determination of the PAI-1 antibody complex \n\n\n [0621] A structure of PAI-1 bound to Antibody 08 Fab was determined by X-ray crystallography. The methods of Fab production, PAI-1 protein preparation, crystallisation and crystallography are generally well-known. Crystals of the complex between a stability mutant of PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 190) and Antibody 08 Fab fragment were obtained by known methods. The \n\n crystal form of the complex was that of thin plates with the monoclinic space group P21. \n\n\nComplete diffraction data initially to 3.2 A and subsequently to 2.9 A resolution were obtained. The structure could be solved by Molecular Replacement, using search models derived from previously determined structures of the PAI-1 stability mutant and Fab fragment to enable the correct positioning of all the PAI-1 and the Fab molecules present in the crystallographic asymmetric. There were four PAI-1 molecules and four Fab fragments in the asymmetric unit corresponding to four independently observed complexes and epi/paratopes. \n\n\n[0622] In the crystal structure each of the four complexes has a unique set of crystal packing interactions. Two of the Fab constant domains and the lower part of one of the PAI-1 molecules have very few stabilising interactions in the crystals lattice. This results in partial disordering as indicated by the high average B-factor for those domains. These regions are flexible and adopt different orientations throughout the crystal such that the electron density is averaged out. In contrast, all the Fab variable domains and their CDRs as well as all of the interacting area of the PAI-1 molecules are well ordered. All four complexes can be used to validate the binding mode and epi/paratope. Within the accuracy expected from a 2.9 A structure solved by molecular replacement the four observed epi/paratopes appear to be nearly identical. The presence of two water molecules (potentially crucial for binding) is inferred although not proven by the structure, since that requires a resolution better than 2.5A. \n\n\n [0623] The crystal structure allows the epitope and paratope interactions between PAI-1 and Fab to be examined in atomic detail. These are shown in Table 10. Interactions within 3.2A are polar, for example H bonds. Interactions within 4.0 A are non-polar and interactions within 5.0A are closely neighbouring. Whilst the stability mutant of PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 190) was used in this work, the residue numbering of PAI-1 given in this example and Table 10 is that of mature human PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 124). For example, Arg271 of mature human PAI-1 corresponds to Arg292 in SEQ ID NO: 190. The numbering for heavy and light chain residues given in this example and Table 10 is Kabat numbering, with the residue numbering as determined by crystal structure analysis given in parenthesis, where different. The H-bonding network comprises a bond between residue Arg 271 of mature human PAI-1 and light chain residues Asn 32 and Ser 92, residue Ala 348 of PAI-1 and heavy chain residue Glu 100A (105) and residue Glu 350 of PAI-1 with heavy chain residue Arg 97 (101) and light chain residue Lys \n\n 50. Interactions between PAI-1 and the light chain and heavy chain are shown in Figures 12 and 13, respectively. \n\n\n [0624] A salt bridge is present between residues Glu 212 of human mature PAI-1 and light chain residue 66. Mutation studies in which residue Glu 212 of PAI-1 was mutated to Val 212 resulted in a decrease of binding activity between PAI-1 and Antibody 08 due to loss of this salt bridge. \n\n\n [0625] Residue Arg 271 of human mature PAI-1 forms a H-bond within the main chain of light chain residue Ser 92. Residue Ala 348 of PAI-1 interacts with the main chain of heavy chain residue Glu 100A (105). Buried in the interface with heavy chain residue Leu 100 (104) are the PAI-1 residues Ala 348, Pro 349 and Glu 350. PAI-1 residue Glu 350 bridges the heavy and light chains of Antibody 08 forming interactions with heavy chain residue Arg 97 (101) and light chain residue Lys 50. \n\n\n [0626] All the amino acids from Antibody 08 that contribute to binding human mature\n\n\nPAI-1 are from the heavy and light chain CDRs, except for residues Arg 66, Ser 67 and Gly 68 (RSG 66-68) of the light chain of Antibody 08. The paratope residues of Antibody 08 are underlined in the table below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Superimposition with latent PAI-1 \n\n\n [0627] The active form of PAI-1 mainly reacts with binding agents via the reactive centre loop, which is not present in the latent form. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that active PAI-1 binds Antibody 08 with higher affinity due to H-bond interactions between the reactive centre loop of PAI-1 and Antibody 08 Fab and buried residues 347-350 of the reactive centre loop. This structural information explains the reduced binding between Antibody 08 and latent PAI-1. \n\n B. Glycosylation Sites \n\n\n [0628] The sequence of human mature PAI-1 contains three possible N-glycosylation sites consistent with Asn-X-Thr/Ser motif: N209, N265 and N329. X-ray crystallography studies have confirmed that sites N209 and N265 are utilised for glycosylation whilst the N329 site is not utilised. These glycosylation sites are unlikely to interfere with antibody binding, even though N209 is next to the epitope residue Y210 in sequence. Structural analysis has shown that these glycosylation sites face away from the reactive centre loop of PAI-1 and the side-chain of N209 is oriented away from the interaction interface. \n\n\n C. Epitope comparison with rodent PAI-1 \n\n\n [0629] Alignment of human, murine and rat PAI-1 sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 119-121) indicated three amino acid differences in the PAI-1 epitope between human and rodent PAI-1 (see Figure 14). These epitope amino acids are Y220E, Y241F and E350T, with the changes indicated from human to rodent sequence. As shown by our structural analysis Y220 and Y241 are involved in binding to the light chain and E350 to the heavy chain of Antibody 08. The difference in affinity of Antibody 08 of approximately 10 fold between human and rodent PAI-1 can be accounted for by these amino acid changes in the epitope. In particular, the E350T mutation breaks two H-bonds with R97 (101) and K50, as indicated by structural analysis. \n\n\n D. Epitope comparison with anti-PAI-1 antibodies \n\n\n [0630] A comparison was made between the epitopes of the anti-PAI-1 antibodies scFv-\n\n\n56A7C10 (Bijnens,A.P. et al, 2001 J Biol Chem., 276, 44912-44918: Novoa de Armas,H., et al, 2007 Structure 15, 1105-1116), which binds active PAI-1, MAI- 12 (Dupont et al, 2006 J Biol Chem., 281(47), 36071-36081), which binds latent and active PAI-1, H4B3 (Dupont et al, 2006, supra), which binds latent PAI-1 and Antibody 08. The results are shown in Tables 12 and 13. Table 12 shows that three of the PAI-1 epitope residues recognised by MAI- 12 and four of the epitope residues recognised by H4B3 are also recognised by Antibody 08. Table 13 shows that Antibody 08 has 13 amino acid residues in common with the epitope recognised by scFv- 56A7C10, which comprises 32 amino acid residues. However, as reflected in the table, there are numerous difference in the residues recognized by Antibody 8 compared to those recognized by these other antibodies. \n\n E. Polymorphism changes \n\n\n [0631] As mentioned earlier, a number of polymorphisms have been found in the coding sequence of SERPINEI (PAI-1), five of which change the amino acid sequence (see Table 1). In order to determine whether these amino acid changes were likely to have an effect on antibody binding, the location of these polymorphisms were studied in relation to the crystal structure of PAI-1 /Antibody 08 Fab. Residues 1-23 of human PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 119) are part of the signal peptide and two of the amino acid changes (A15T and VI 71), which result in \n\n\npolymorphisms, are found in this signal peptide. Furthermore, these two amino acid changes are responsible for the highest allele frequency for European, African American, Chinese, and Asian populations. These two amino acid changes do not impact on antibody binding as they are not present in active PAI-1. In addition the amino acid change H25P is not visible in the crystal structure electron density. The epitope region is predominantly at the C-terminus of the structure and although the H25P effect on antibody binding has not been determined, it is unlikely to interfere. Thus, Antibody 8 is likely to bind with substantially the same affinity to the PAI-1 proteins resulting from these polymorphisms. \n\n\n [0632] The three remaining amino acid changes resulting in PAI-1 polymorphisms\n\n\n(R209H, D216 and T255N; SEQ ID NO 119) are visible in the crystal structure. However, the results of our structural modelling work have shown that these amino acids are not structurally part of the identified epitope on PAI-1 and therefore are unlikely to affect PAI-1 /Antibody 08 binding interactions. Therefore, Antibody 08 binds to PAI-1 at an epitope that remains unchanged for most polymorphisms identified, i.e., antibody binding will occur irrespective of the population targeted. \n\n\n Example 13. Mutagenesis studies to confirm crystal structure analysis \n\n\n [0633] A number of the amino acids that are part of the structurally identified epitope were subject to site-directed mutagenesis to determine the effect of the mutation on the P All/antibody Fab binding. A panel of PAI-1 mutant proteins was constructed that each contained a single amino acid mutation compared to the wild-type (wt) sequence. The binding of these mutants to Antibody 08 was then evaluated in biochemical competition assays as described previously, with changes in the concentrations of antibodies and PAI-1 mutant proteins where required. Generation of human PAI-1 and the PAI-1 mutant proteins is detailed in the Materials and Methods section below. \n\n [0634] Data on affinity of antibody binding to PAI-1 mutant proteins were obtained using\n\n\nBIAcore, and indicated that affinity of a candidate antibody of the disclosure for binding the mutant PAI-1 proteins was lower than for binding a stable mutant human PAI-1 (Table 14). \n\n\n[0635] These data indicate that binding to a specific epitope amino acid residue contributes to the mechanism of inhibition of the antibodies disclosed herein. The data further indicate that the Tyr residue at position 210, Glu residue at position 212, Thr residue at position 220, Tyr residue at position 241 and Arg residue at position 271 of mature human PAI-1 (SEQ ID NO: 124) are structurally important for antibody:antigen recognition, confirming that binding members of the disclosure may bind these amino acid residues of mature human PAI-1. \n\n\nASSAY MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR THE EXAMPLES \n\n\n [0636] The detailed methods for assays described in the examples are provided below.\n\n\nNote: IgG used in the assays described herein were produced by expression in HEK cells. \n\n\n A. Chromogenic assay (human) \n\n\n [0637] The assay was carried out at room temperature in 96-well assay plates (Costar) in\n\n\n50 μΐ 100 mM Tris pH 8.4, 106 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80. Recombinant human PAI-1 (Molecular Innovations) was dispensed into the wells to a final concentration of 5 nM, corresponding to its experimentally determined EC80 value. Purified scFv or IgG preparations were quantified and a series of dilutions were added to the wells. After 10 minutes incubation, human tPA (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim) was added to a final concentration of 2.14 nM, and the samples were incubated for a further 5 minutes. Finally, the chromogenic substrate (S2288, Quadratech) was added to a final concentration of 920 μΜ, corresponding to the experimentally determined K\nm\n value. After 1 hour 15 minutes incubation, colour generation was measured as absorbance at 405 nm using an En Vision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Raw absorbance data was first converted to % PAI-1 activity where 100% was taken from control wells containing PAI-1 but no inhibitor and 0% was taken from control wells containing no PAI-1. Resultant data was then analysed using Prism curve fitting software (Graphpad) to determine IC\n50\n values. \n\n\n B. Adaptations to chromogenic assay for other species \n\n\n [0638] PAI-1 was used at experimentally determined EC80 concentrations, as shown in the table below. The chromogenic substrate (S2288, Quadratech) for all tPA was added to final \n\n concentrations corresponding to the experimentally determined Km values for the respective tPA, as shown in the table below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. HT-1080 cell based plasminogen activation assay \n\n\n [0639] HT-1080 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, ECACC) were seeded in\n\n\n96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture assay plates (Costar) at 2xl0\n4\n cells/well. They were cultured in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) with Earles salts and L-glutamine, 10% (v/v) heat inactivated Australian foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) MEM -non-essential amino acids (without L-glutamine) (all from Invitrogen) for 24 hours in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and \n\n 5% C0\n2\n. Prior to use in the assay, the media was aspirated and the cell monolayers were washed twice with 200 μΐ phenol red-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen). \n\n\n[0640] In parallel, dilution series of purified anti-PAI-1 scFv or IgG were prepared in\n\n\nHBSS and pre-incubated with human recombinant PAI-1 (10 nM final concentration, Molecular Innovations) for 30 minutes at room temperature. 100 μΐ were then transferred to the pre-washed cells, and the reaction was started by adding human plasma Lys-plasminogen (Calbiochem) and the uPA/tPA-substrate S-2251 (H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitro-anilide, Chromogenix) to final concentrations of 5 μg/ml and 0.2 mM, respectively. The cells were incubated for up to 3 hours at 37 °C and 5% C0\n2\n, during which the generation of coloured uPA/tPA-product was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm using a Victor plate reader (PerkinElmer). Absorbance values were analysed by performing an Area Under Curve (AUC) analysis for each \n\n\nconcentration of anti-PAI-1 scFv or IgG and normalised for control rates without antibody (100% in the absence of PAI-1, 0% in the presence of PAI-1). The data was plotted as % of the control response against log(concentration of scFv or IgG) and IC\n50\n values were determined using Prism curve fitting software (Graphpad). \n\n\n D. Competition binding assay \n\n\n [0641] The assay was carried out at room temperature. Purified IgG antibodies were adsorbed to 96-well flat-bottomed Maxisorp assay plates (Nunc) in 50 μΐ PBS at a concentration which gave a significant signal when biotinylated active human PAI-1 (Molecular Innovations, biotinylated in house) was added at approximately its predetermined KD for that particular IgG. Excess IgG was washed away with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T20/0.1) and the wells were blocked with 300 μΐ PBS containing 3% (w/v) dried milk powder (Marvel) for 1 hour. A dilution series of competitor mouse, rat or rabbit PAI-1 (all US Biological) was prepared in PBS, starting at a concentration of >200-fold the KD value of the interaction between biotinylated active human PAI-1 and the respective IgG. Insulin was included as an irrelevant antigen control, unbiotinylated active human PAI-1 as a positive control. To this series, an equal volume of biotinylated recombinant human PAI-1 at a concentration of approximately 2-fold the KD was added (resulting in a series starting at a ratio of competitor antigen:biotinylated active human PAI-1 of >100: 1). These mixtures were then transferred onto the blocked IgG. After 1 hour equilibration, unbound antigen was removed by washing 3 times with 300 μΐ PBS-T20/0.1, while the remaining biotinylated human PAI-1 was detected by streptavidin-Europium3+ conjugate \n\n (PerkinElmer). Fluorescence was measured on an En Vision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Raw absorbance data was first converted to % PAI-1 specificity (100% was determined from control wells containing biotinylated human PAI-1 but no competitor, 0% was from wells containing biotinylated human PAI-1 and a 50-fold excess of unbiotinylated human PAI-1). Resultant data were analyzed using Prism curve fitting software (Graphpad) to determine IC50 values. Due to the different affinities of each IgG to PAI-1, and therefore the different assay conditions used, results were expressed as fold difference in IC50s between active human PAI-1 and competing antigens. This enables comparison of different IgGs. \n\n\n E. Protocol for SDS-PAGE analysis of inhibition of PAI-l:tPA complex formation \n\n\n [0642] 2 μg recombinant active human PAI-1 derived from E. coli (Molecular \n\n\n Innovations) or produced in house by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Stromqvist 1994) were incubated for 15 minutes with 1 μg human tPA (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim) at 37 °C in a final volume of 25 μΐ PBS, pH 7.5. Anti-PAI-1 antibodies were tested by pre-incubating 20 μg IgG with PAI-1 for 10 minutes prior to addition of tPA to initiate the reaction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 8 μΐ SDS-PAGE buffer followed by heating at 90 °C. Aliquots of the samples were analyzed on a 12 % Bis-Tris Novex NuPAGE gel run in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were detected using Coomassie blue stain. \n\n\n F. Peptide binding scan (PEPSCAN) method \n\n\n [0643] Overlapping linear 15-mer and constrained (looped) 8-, 10-, and 12-mer synthetic peptides derived from the mature human PAI-1 sequence were synthesised and screened using credit-card format mini-PEPSCAN cards (455 -well-plate with 3 μΐ wells) as described previously (Slootstra-JW; Puijk-WC; Ligtvoet-GJ; Langeveld-JP; Meloen-RH (1996). Mol- Divers. 1 : 87-96). In addition, a set of double looped synthetic peptides were synthesised. In total 3310 peptides were synthesised. Binding of antibodies to each peptide was tested in a PEPSCAN enzyme-linked immuno assay (ELISA). 455-well credit card-format polypropylene cards containing the covalently linked peptides were incubated with antibody samples at either 0.05 or 0.01 μg/ml. After washing, the bound antibody was detected with an anti-antibody peroxidase conjugate and the peroxidase substrate 2,2'-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) and hydrogen peroxide. The colour development was quantified with a CCD-camera and an image processing system. \n\n G. Production and Analysis of Antibody 08 Fab for X-ray crystallography \n\n\n [0644] Purified Antibody 08 was digested to generate Fab fragments as follows: \n\n\n - a digest buffer of 30mM DL-cysteine hydrochloride dissolved in GIBCO PBS \n\n\n(Invitrogen) was prepared. \n\n\n - papain from papaya latex (Sigma) was reconstituted in digest buffer to give a lOmg/ml solution and kept at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes before use. \n\n\n - cysteine was added to IgG to give a 30 mM solution. \n\n\n - papain was added to the IgG at a ration of 1 mg papain to 100 mg IgG. \n\n\n - the digest was terminated after 4.5 hours by the addition of 0.5 M iodoacetamide (Sigma) to give 50 mM iodoacetamide in the final digest mixture. \n\n\n [0645] The Fab was then purified using Q Sepharose (GE Healthcare), buffer exchanged into PBS (Gibco) pH 7.2 and concentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml for use in X-ray crystallography, which is described below. \n\n\n H. X-ray crystal structure determination: Protein preparation, crystallisation and crystallography \n\n\n [0646] Purified protein of a stable quadruple mutant of PAI-1 (Berkanpas, M.B.,\n\n\nLawrance, D.A. and Ginsburg, D. 1995. EMBO Journal, 14, 2969-2977) (SEQ ID NO: 190) was obtained from Jim Huntington, University of Cambridge, which had been produced according to the protocol referred to in Zhou et al (Zhou, A. et al, 2003 Nature Struc. Biol, 10(7), 541-544). \n\n\n[0647] The material used for crystallisation was formulated by mixing the proteins in their original buffer in a 1 : 1 ratio followed by a rapid buffer exchange step to a solution of 15 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.4 using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Prior to the \n\n\ncrystallisation the complex was concentrated to 3 - 9 mg/ml using a 500 μΐ 30kDa molecular weight cut-off centrifugal concentrator (Millipore Biomax) that had previously been washed with 1 ml of the same buffer solution. \n\n\n [0648] Sitting drop vapour diffusion crystallisation screening was carried out at 20 °C using Greiner low profile trays and 150 nl + 150 nl drops. Crystals representing mainly one unique crystal form could be grown from a wide range of conditions e.g., large PEGs with and without the addition of 0.1 - 0.5 M of common salts and a pH around 7. The crystals with the best initial diffraction were grown from a drop that contained 0.1 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10%, PEG 8000, 0.15 M LiCl, 10% ethylene glycol. \n\n [0649] Diffraction quality crystals were grown from a 2 μΐ + 2 μΐ hanging drop that contained 8% PEG 8000, 0.2M LiCl and 20% ethylene glycol. Due to the high concentration of ethylene glycol, the crystals could be harvested and flash frozen directly from the drops. \n\n\nScreening for anisotropically diffracting, non-twinned crystals was carried out using a Rigaku FRE rotation anode generator equipped with a mar225CCD detector and MSC X-stream cryo head and also at the beamline 911 :2 at MaxLab equipped with a marl65CCD detector and X- stream cryo head. Crystals that showed ordered diffraction were stored in preparation for data collection on the ID-23 and ID-29 beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. \n\n\n [0650] Diffraction data sets were collected from single crystals cooled at 100K at ESRF.\n\n\nThe first data set was collected at beamline ID23, employing a ADSC Quantum Q315r detector. The data set was recorded at a wavelength of 1.072 A over an angular range of 180° in rotation frames of 0.3°. The crystal diffracted to a nominal resolution of 3.2A and belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with a cell dimensions of a = 90.1 A, b = 89.7 A, and c = 250.8 A with β = 99.8°. This data set was used to solve the initial structure. A second data set to higher resolution, used for the final refinement, was collected at beamline ID29, employing a ADSC Quantum Q315r detector. This data set was recorded at a wavelength of 0.976 A over an angular range of 220° in rotation frames of 0.2°. The crystal diffracted to 2.9A and belonged to the same monoclinic space group P21 with cell dimensions of a = 90.2 A, b = 89.5 A, and c = 249.7 A with β = 99.8°. Reflections from each dataset were integrated with MOSFLM (Leslie,A. 1991 In Moras,D., Podjarny,A.D. and ThierryJ.C. (eds), Crystallographic Computing V. Oxford \n\n\nUniversity Press, Oxford, UK, 27-38) and merged and scaled individually with the SCALA programs from the CCP4 suite (CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4) 1994 Acta Cryst. D 50, 760-763). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 11. \n\n\n[0651] The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains four molecules of the Fab fragment and four molecules of the PAI-1 molecule resulting in a Matthews coefficient of 2.68 A3/Da (Matthews, J.Mol.Biol 33, 491-497) corresponding to a solvent content of 54%>. The structure of the PAI-1 stability mutant/CAZlOOl Fab complex was determined by the method of molecular replacement using the CCP4 program MOLREP (CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4) 1994 Acta Cryst. D 50, 760-763). The structure was determined by using a crystal structure of PAI-1 stability mutant (pdb 1DVM (Stout,T.J. et al, 2000 Biochemistry, 39, 8460- \n\n 8469)) and a crystal structure of Fab (PDB entry 1 AQK (Faber et al., 1998 Immunotecfinology, 3, 253-270)) as search models. Independent searches were done with PAI-1 and the constant and variable domains of the Fab. \n\n\n [0652] Manual rebuilding of the Fab model and the introduction of the correct amino acid sequence were performed using the model building and validation program COOT \n\n\n(Emsley,P. & Cowtan,K. 2004 Acta Cryst. D60, 2126-2132). Loops that in the initial map were identified as being different to the search model, including most of the CDRs, were truncated and the remainder of the model was sent through crystallographic refinement using Autobuster (Roversi,P., et al, 2000 Acta Cryst., D56, 1313-1323). \n\n\n [0653] A complete model could be built of the complex with the interpretation of the density of the CDR region facilitated by the access to the observation from the all the four independently determined complexes. The structure - containing 4 Fab molecules and 4 PAI-1 molecules was refined to convergence using Autobuster and in the remaining cycles REFMAC (Murshudov,G.N., et al, 1997 Acta Cryst., D53, 240-255) that was primarily used to tighten the stereochemistry and add 100 of the most well ordered water molecules. The final R-factors, Rwork and Rfree are 25.0% and 30.0%, respectively. \n\n\n I. Generation of human PAI-1 and PAI-1 mutant proteins for epitope mapping and Cloning of human PAI-1 cDNA \n\n\n [0654] The sequence of human PAI-1 was obtained from Embl (Accession No: M16006).\n\n\nUsing this sequence oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the cDNA encoding human PAI-1 without the signal peptide. The N-terminal primer was HPAIlNde and \n\n\n HPAIlXhoI was used as the C terminal primer (See Table 15 for oligonucleotides sequences). \n\n\n [0655] A PCR reaction to amplify the cDNA was carried out. The template for the PCR reaction was 10 ng of cDNA obtained from human small intestine. The amplified cDNA from each reaction was purified and cloned into pCR4blunt topo (Invitrogen) using the topoisomerase ligation reaction according to the manufacturer. \n\n\n [0656] Positive clones were identified and sequenced. The resulting cDNAs were sub- cloned using standard techniques into an E. coli T7-promoter expression vector in such a way that the cDNA encoding mature human PAI-1 was fused at the N-terminus with an N-terminal tag containing a HIS6 sequence immediately upstream of the sequence VHH of mature PAI-1 to generate the plasmid pT7H14hPAIl . \n\n J. Generation of the PAI-1 stable mutant \n\n\n [0657] A stable mutant of human PAI-1 (Berkanpas, M.B., et al, 1995, supra) (SEQ ID\n\n\nNO: 190) with N150H, K154T, Q319L and M354I mutations (positions 171, 175, 340 and 375 respectively in SEQ ID NO: 190) was generated by site directed mutagenesis using a \n\n\nQuickchange™ multi mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutagenesis primer design was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol and primers are shown in Table 15. Plasmid pT7H14hPAIl was used in the single reaction as template. This was followed by subsequent Dpril digestion and transformation into chemically competent E. coli cells with selection on agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C overnight. Several clones were sequenced and one was identified which had all four of the mutations incorporated. This was designated plasmid pT7H14hstablePAIl . \n\n\n K. Generation of mutations of the stable PAI-1 mutant for epitope mapping \n\n\n [0658] Several further mutants of stable human PAI-1 were designed using information from the latent and active structures of human PAI-1. Oligonucleotides (Table 15) were designed in order to generate the mutants by site directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange™ multi mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The template for each individual reaction was pT7H14hstablePAIl and each individual mutagenesis reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Several clones were sequenced from each reaction and plasmid DNA of one correct clone from each reaction was retained for further use. \n\n\n L. Expression of PAI-1 mutant proteins \n\n\n [0659] The HIS-tagged PAI-1 expression plasmids were transformed into chemically competent BL21 (DE3) star cells (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's method. Transformed cells were used to inoculate 1 L cultures of Terrific Broth and these were incubated on an orbital incubator at 37 °C, until the A600 reached 0.6. IPTG was then added to 0.25 mM and incubation continued for 4h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellets were stored at -80 °C. \n\n\n M. Purification of PAI-1 mutant proteins \n\n\n [0660] The cell pellets from 500 ml were thawed and resuspended in 50 ml Buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH7, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM Imidazole) then lysed by sonication (4 x 30 \n\n seconds on ice at setting 6.5). The lysate was then spun at 100 OOOg in Ti45 rotor for 30 minutes at 4 °C to give clarified lysate. \n\n\n [0661] The lysate was loaded onto a 5 ml Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated with buffer\n\n\nA. The sample was loaded onto the column and washed with 5 column volumes (CV) of buffer A followed by 5CV of 5% Buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH7, 150 mM NaCl and 300 mM \n\n\nImidazole) and then 5 CV of 10% Buffer B. The protein was eluted with 100% buffer B. The fractions containing the PAI-1 protein were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. \n\n\n[0662] The frozen protein was thawed and was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm, 4 °C for lOmin. The protein was then concentrated at 4°C using a Vivaspin 10 centrifuged at 4000rpm. The concentrated protein was then run through a Superdex 200 1660 column equilibrated in 10 mM NaAc, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH5.6. \n\n\n [0663] Fractions containing PAI-1 protein were pooled. The purity was checked by SDS\n\n\nPAGE gel electrophoresis, and a sample tested for PAI-1 activity using the tPA assay. 1 μg PAI- 1 (7.5 μί) was mixed with 2.5 PBS and 2.5 μΐ\n^\n 0.2 mg/mL tPA. A control of no tPA and no PAI-1 was also used. After heating at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 12.5 μΐ\n^\n x4 SDS PAGE loading buffer with no reducing agent. The samples were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel and stained. tPA forms a covalent complex with the active PAI-1 which runs at a higher molecular weight than the tPA only control. \n\n\n [0664] Mass spectroscopy was used to measure the mass of each of the proteins. All of the proteins were of the predicted mass without the N-terminal methionine. Each purified PAI-1 protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. \n\n\nN. BIAcore measurements \n\n\n [0665] BIAcore studies in Example 7, were undertaken using a BIAcore 2000™. \n\n\n Antibody 08 was coupled to the surface of a CM-5 sensorchip using an amine coupling kit to provide a surface density of 220-225 Ru. Stable mutant human PAI-1 or PAI-1 mutant proteins at a range of concentrations between 200 nM and 0.2 nM in HBS-EP buffer were passed over the sensor chip surface. The resulting sensorgrams were evaluated using BIA evaluation 3.1 software to calculate the k\non\n, k\noff\n and K\nD\n values for the antibody tested. \n\n LITERATURE \n\n\n [0666] All publications, patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference into the specification to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [0667] Foote J, Winter G.

Description\n\n\n\n\n COMBRETASTATIN ANALOGS FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER \n\n\nThe present invention relates to specific analogs of combretastatin, in particular the compounds of formula (I) as defined herein, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, as well as their medical use, in particular in the treatment or prevention of cancer, including multidrug-resistant cancer. \n\n\nThe chemotherapy of cancer is generally limited by the high incidence of malignant tumors that display resistance to a range of chemical anti-tumor agents, either intrinsically or acquired upon repeated administration. Currently, there are no clinically established chemotherapeutical agents capable of overcoming this so-called multidrug resistance. An alternative therapy of such cases is not available, either. A water-soluble phosphate prodrug of the angiotoxic, naturally occurring lead compound combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) has already entered clinical phase I! and IIS trials against various incurable cancer diseases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CA-4 and analogs thereof are strongly cytotoxic and selectively disrupt tumoral vasculature or prevent its neoformation (so-called antivascular or antiangiogenic effect, respectively). They also bind to tubulin and inhibit its polymerization thus impeding the cell proliferation (antimitotic effect). In combination, these effects lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and of the growth and spread of solid tumors (invasion, metastasis). \n\n\nA drawback of CA-4 is its insufficient cytotoxicity which necessitates combination regimens with carboptatin or taxol in the therapy of solid tumors. Treatment with CA-4 alone often led to the persistence of peripheral cancer cells and hence to tumor relapses (Tron et al., J. Med. \n\n Chem. 2006, 49, 3033-3044; Lippert, Bioorg. Med. Chern. 2007, 15, 605-615). The related CA-1 and its bisphosphate prodrug ΟΧΪ4503 were also impressively efficacious in certain tumor modeis owing to their catechoie moiety. Catecholes are known to undergo redox cycling via quinoid intermediates thus mediating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the alkylation of bionucleophiles (Ho!well et al., Anticancer Res. 2002, 22, 3933- 40; Folkes et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007, 20, 1885-1894). \n\n\nThe problem of insufficient cytotoxicity of CA-4 in vivo was overcome by developing combretastatin A-1 diphosphate which has a direct impact on cancer cells. However, like CA-4 this compound is prone to isomerization and thus deactivation. A preclinical study revealed that this isomerization can be precluded by replacing the olefin bridge by five- membered heterocycfes such as oxazoies or imidazoles (Wang et al., J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 1697-171 1 ). The resulting products are characterized by an improved water solubility and applicability in vivo without the need of prodrug formulations. In another study CA-4 analogous 3-halostilbenes were shown to have an enhanced affinity for tubulin and a more selective profile of efficacy (Pettit et al., J. Nat. Prod. 2005, 68, 1450-1458). Similar compounds are furthermore disclosed in: WO 01/09103; Vasiievsky et al, Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, 2008, 44(10), 1257-1261 ; Orsini et al., Natural stilbenes and analoga as antineoplastic agents, in: Atta-ur-Rahman, Studies in Natural Products Chemistry, Bioactive Natural Products, Part N, 2008, Volume 34; Brown et al., Top. Heterocycl. Chem. 2006, 2, 1-51 ; Kiss LE et al., J Med Chem, 2010, 53(8), 3396-41 1 ; and Ohsumi K et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 1998, 8{22), 3153-8. \n\n\nCompounds resembling those prepared by Wang et al. or Pettit et al. fulfil only some rather than all of the requirements for optimum anti-tumor efficacy. Derivatives reminiscent of those described by Wang et ai. feature favourable pharmacological properties yet diminished tubulin affinity and cytotoxicities {ca. 1/100 th of that of CA-4) that are insufficient to treat resistant tumors effectively. On the other hand, compounds with increased cytotoxicity showed unfavourable pharmacological properties and lacked antivascular efficacy and activity against resistant tumors. Among the 3-halocombretastatin-A derivatives disclosed by Pettit et ai. there are some with distinct cytotoxic properties. However, owing to their stilbene nature and their lack of a stabilizing heterocyclic bridge, they tend to isomerize with loss of anticancer activity. In addition, their solubility in water and thus their applicability in vivo is rather limited unless converted into a phosphate ester. They were not amenable to tests with in vivo models. Moreover, the efficacy of the compounds described in Wang et al. and in Pettit et al. in the treatment of multi-resistant cancer and, in particular, in the treatment of CA-4- refractory cancer has not been examined. \n\n Hence, there is a strong demand for improved methods for the treatment or prevention of cancer, in particular mu!tidrug-resistant cancer. The compounds of formula (1), (I!) or (HI) as defined herein below have an improved efficacy against cancer, in particular against resistant tumor cells, and sufficient solubility in water or serum. They generally have a low toxicity which avoids cumulative dose restrictions and leads to improved tolerance. Furthermore, they have an improved chemical stability and thus reduced tendency to inactivation. \n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention relates to a compound of formula (I) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Q or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof. \n\n\nX is selected from O, S, N(H), or N(Ci_4 alkyl).

Particularly preferred compounds of formula (lii) are the following compounds 9a, 9b and 9c: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9a 9b 9c \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"alkyl\" refers to a monovalent saturated aliphatic (i.e. non-aromatic) acyclic hydrocarbon group (i.e. a group consisting of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms) which may be linear or branched and does not comprise any carbon-to-carbon double bond or any carbon-to-carbon triple bond. Accordingly, the term \"C^ alky!\" refers to methyl, ethyl, propyl (e.g., n-propyl or isopropyl), or butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, or sec-butyl). \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"halogen\" refers to -F, -CI, -Br, or -I, and in particular to -F, -CI, or -Br. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof, in combination with a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable excipient. Accordingly, the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (III) are useful as medicaments. \n\n The present invention further relates to a compound of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the aforementioned entities in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, for use in the treatment or prevention of cancer. The use of the above compound for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of cancer is also within the scope of the invention. \n\n\nFurthermore, the invention encompasses a method of treating or preventing cancer, the method comprising the administration of a compound of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the aforementioned entities in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, to a subject in need of such a treatment or prevention. The cancer to be treated or prevented with the compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention includes, for example, breast (mamma) cancer, genitourinary cancer (such as, e.g., prostate tumor, including a hormone-refractory prostate tumor, or germ cell cancer), lung cancer (such as, e.g., small cell or non-small cell lung tumor), gastrointestinal cancer (such as, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal tumor, colon cancer or gastric cancer), epidermoid cancer (such as, e.g., epidermoid head and/or neck tumor or mouth tumor), melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreas cancer, neuroblastoma, head and/or neck cancer, bladder cancer, renal cancer, brain cancer, leukemia (such as, e.g., lymphocytic leukemia or myelogenous leukemia), or lymphoma. It is particularly preferred that the cancer to be treated or prevented with the compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention is a multidrug-resistant cancer. The cancer to be treated may thus be a multidrug-resistant form of the above described cancers. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cancer to be treated or prevented with the compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein is resistant against com breta statin A-4 and/or cisplatin. Accordingly, in the present invention the treatment or prevention of combretastatin A-4 (CA-4)-refractory cancer or cisplatin- refractory cancer is particularly envisaged. \n\n\nThe compounds according to the invention have been found to be surprisingly effective in the medical intervention of multidrug-resistant cancer and, in particular, of CA4- refractory cancer, which has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including in a mouse xenograft model (cf. Example 3 and Figures 3, 4 and 5). \n\n It has been demonstrated that the new compounds exhibit a distinct cytotoxic, antiangiogenic/antivascular and antimitotic effect. In addition, the imidazole/oxazole bridge in the molecular structure of the new compounds gives rise to a stable cis-configu ration of the C=C-double bond between the arene rings and thus to a high chemical and pharmacological stability. Any isomerization to a trans-stilben with loss of anti-tumor activity is no longer possible. Moreover, their polar substituents render the new compounds very well soluble in water and so directly applicable without employment of a vehicle. These compounds can be administered by injection as solutions in physiological saline solution. Such solutions were shown to be stable for at least one month under ambient conditions without any noticeable loss of activity. In animal studies of a multi-resistant tumor model the new compounds were found anti-tumor active causing a dramatic regression of the tumor xenografts. The strong antivascular effect selectively affecting the tumoral vasculature was unambiguously confirmed by visible hemorrhages of the tumoral tissue. No unwanted side effects were observed when the new compounds were applied at efficacious concentrations. This underscores their high tumor selectivity and their excellent tolerance in vivo. Thus the attachment of special ring substituents at defined positions, as described herein for the compounds of formula (I), (II) and (111), results in enhanced anti-tumor activity, improved pharmacological properties as well as in superior tolerance in vivo and in the potential to overcome chemoresistance of tumors. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention have surprisingly been found to exhibit a synergistic effect resulting from the combination of a high cytotoxicity and a strong antivascular effect selectively affecting the tumoral vasculature, as also demonstrated in the Examples. The nature of the halogen substituent in R in formula (I) is crucial for the selectivity of the compounds according to the invention and the magnitude of their bioactivity. Unlike its chioro congener 5b (structure shown in Example 4), the bromo imidazole 6b was vascular disrupting in tumor xenografts while leaving regular vasculature in chicken embryos (CAM assay) alone. The compounds of the invention are also characterized by an outstanding tumor-selective cytotoxicity and a strong induction of cancer cell apoptosis. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention, including the compounds of formula (I), further have advantageous properties with respect to solubility in water and chemical stability in solution, as also demonstrated in Example 3 and Figures 1 and 2. For example, the solubility of the compounds 5b, 6b and 8a according to the present invention in water exceeded a concentration of 10 mg/mL Thus, these compounds are even more water-soluble than the potassium salt of combretastatin A-4-phosphate (about 5 mg/mL; Bedford et a!., Bioorg. Med. \n\n Chem. Lett. 1996, 6, 157-160). Also for this reason, the compounds of the invention, including the compounds of formula (I), are particularly suitable and effective as medicaments, including as medicaments in the treatment or prevention of cancer. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are particularly advantageous in respect of cytotoxicity, solubility in water, and chemical stability, as has been shown in the appended examples for the compound 5b according to the invention. In particular, compound 5b is highly cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo (likewise in CA-4- and cisplatin-resistant cell Sines), shows an improved water solubility compared with CA-4-phosphate and can not isomerize to inactive frans-isomers iike CA-4. Compound 5b is nevertheless well tolerated and selective in mouse xenografts. The compounds of the present invention can thus be administered without the need of prodrug forms, such as phosphate prodrug forms used for combretastatin-A4. However, in one embodiment prodrugs can be used, if desired. For a person skilled in the field of synthetic chemistry, various ways for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention, including the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (III), will be readily apparent. For example, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to the following general protocol. First, the respective para-toluenesu!fonylmethylisocyanides (Tos iC derivatives) are prepared (Scheme 1 ). Commercially available 5-chloro- or 5-bromovanillin 1a/b were reacted with iodomethane and potassium carbonate to give the veratraldehydes 2a/b which were converted to the tosylmethylformamides 3a/b by reaction with para-toluenesulfinic acid and formamide in the presence of camphorsulfonic acid, !n the same way, 5-nitrovanillin (1c) as obtained by reaction of vanillin with fuming nitric acid in acetic acid was methylated to give veratraldehyde 2c which was converted to formamide 3c, Subsequently, the formamides 3 were dehydrated to the 3-substituted TosM!C-derivatives 4 by treatment with phosphoroxychloride. \n\n\n \n\n Scheme 1 : Synthesis of para-toluenesuifonylmethySisocyanides 4.

Exemplary base addition salts comprise, for example, alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium salts; ammonium salts; aliphatic amine salts such as trimethyiamine, triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamtne, procaine salts, \n\n meglumine salts, diethanol amine salts or ethylenediamine salts; aralkyl amine salts such as Ν,Ν-dibenzy!ethylenediamine salts, benetamine salts; heterocyclic aromatic amine salts such as pyridine salts, picoline salts, quinoline salts or isoquinoiine salts; quaternary ammonium salts such as tetramethyiammonium salts, tetraethylammonium salts, benzyltrimethylarnmonium salts, benzyltriethylammonium salts, benzyltributyiammonium salts, methyltrioctyiammonium salts or tetrabutylammonium salts; and basic amino acid salts such as arginine salts or lysine salts. Exemplary acid addition salts comprise, for example, mineral acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate salts, nitrate salts, phosphate salts (such as, e.g., phosphate, hydrogenphosphate, or dthydrogenphosphate salts), carbonate salts, hydrogencarbonate salts or perchlorate salts; organic acid salts such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate, cyclopentanepropionate, undecanoate, lactate, maleate, oxalate, fumarate, tartrate, maiate, citrate, nicotinate, benzoate, salicylate or ascorbate salts; sulfonate salts such as methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate (tosy!ate), 2-naphthalenesulfonate, 3-phenylsulfonate, or camphorsulfonate salts; and acidic amino acid salts such as aspartate or glutamate salts. \n\n\nMoreover, the scope of the invention embraces solid forms of the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (111) in any soivated form, including e.g. solvates with water, for example hydrates, or with organic solvents such as, e.g., methanol, ethanol or acetonitriie, i.e. as a methanolate, ethanolate or acetonitrilate, respectively; or in the form of any polymorph. \n\n\nFurthermore, the formulas in the present application are intended ΐο cover all possible stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, of the indicated compounds. \n\n\nThus, all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (111) are contemplated as part of the present invention, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The scope of the compounds according to the invention embraces all the possible stereoisomers and their mixtures. It particularly embraces the racemic forms and the isolated optical isomers. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, e.g., fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chirai column chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the racemates using conventional methods, such as, e.g., salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization. \n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of formula (!), (II) or (III) are derivatives which have chemically or metabolicai!y cleavable groups and become, by \n\n soivolysis or under physiological conditions, the compounds of the present invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Prodrugs of the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (III) may be formed in a conventional manner with a functional group of the compounds such as with an amino or a hydroxy! group. The prodrug derivative form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgaard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). When a compound employed in the present invention has a hydroxy! group, an acyloxy derivative prepared by reacting the hydroxyl group with a suitable acylhalide or a suitable acid anhydride is exemplified as a prodrug. An especially preferred acyloxy derivative as a prodrug is - OC(=0)-CH\n3\n, -OC(=0)-C\n2\nH\n5\n, -OC(=0)-(tert-Bu), -OC(=0)-C\n15\nH\n31\n, -OC(=0)-(m-COONa- Ph), -OC(=0)-CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCOONa\n!\n -0(C=0)-CH(NH\n2\n)CH\n3\n or -OC(=0)-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n. When a compound employed in the present invention has an amino group, an amide derivative prepared by reacting the amino group with a suitable acid halide or a suitable mixed anhydride is exemplified as a prodrug. An especially preferred amide derivative as a prodrug is -NHC(=OHCH\n2\n)\n2\nOCH\n3\n or -NHC(=0)-CH(NH\n2\n)CH\n3\n. Accordingly, the compound of formula (I) may be used as a prodrug, wherein the prodrug is a compound of formula (!), in which one or more amino groups, if present, are in the form of an amide, such as e.g. in the form of -NHC(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\n2\nOCH\n3\n or -NHC(=0)-CH(NH\n2\n)CH\n3\n, or in which one or more hydroxyl groups, if present, are in the form of an acyloxy, such as e.g. in the form of - OC(=0)-CH\n3!\n -OC(=0)-C\n2\nH\n5\n, -OC(=0)-(tert-Bu),\n\n\n-OC(=0)-C\n1s\nH\n31\n, -OC(=0)-(m-COONa-Ph), ~OC(=0)-CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCOONa, ~0(C=0)~ CH(NH\n2\n)CH\n3\n or -OC(=0)-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, or in the form of a phosphate, i.e. in the form of -O- P(=0)(0\n~\n)\n2\n, or a phosphate salt (such as, e.g., the base addition salts described herein above). Thus, if R\n2\n and/or R\n3\n in the compound of formula (l) is -OH (i.e., hydroxyl), then a corresponding prodrug may be the compound of formula (I), in which the hydroxyl group which is R\n2\n (if applicable) and/or the hydroxy! group which is R\n3\n (if applicable) is in the form of a phosphate (i.e. in the form of -0-P(=0)(0\n~\n)2), a phosphate salt, or an acyloxy, preferably in the form of a phosphate or a phosphate salt (e.g., with sodium, potassium, or any of the cations referred to in respect of the base addition salts described herein above). A preferred prodrug of the compounds of the present invention is a compound of formula (I), in which R\n2\n is -0-P(=0)(OH)\n2\n or a salt thereof (e.g., a disodium or a dipotassium salt). \n\n\nThe compounds described herein may be administered as compounds per se or may be formulated as medicaments. The medicaments/pharmaceutical compositions may optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as carriers, diluents, fillers, disintegrants, lubricating agents, binders, colorants, pigments, stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, or solubility enhancers. \n\n In particular, the pharmaceutical compositions may comprise one or more solubility enhancers, such as, e.g., poly(ethy!ene glycol), including poly{ethylene glycol) having a molecular weight in the range of about 200 to about 5,000 Da, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, non-ionic surfactants, tyloxapol, polysorbate 80, macrogol-15-hydroxystearate, phospholipids, lecithin, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, cyc!odextrins, hydroxyethyl-p-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyi-Y-cycSodextrin, hydroxypropyl-y-cyclodextrin, dihydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin, glucosyl-a-cyclodextrin, glucosyl^-cyclodextrin, diglucosyl- -cyclodextrin, maltosyl-a-cyclodextrin, maltosyl- -cyclodextrin, maltosyl-y-cyciodextrin, maltotriosyl-β- cyclodextrin, maltotriosyl-y-cyclodextrin, dimaitosyl-p-cyclodextrin, methyi^-cyclodextrin, carboxyalkyi thioethers, hydroxypropyi methylceliulose, hydroxypropyicelluiose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, vinyl acetate copolymers, vinyl pyrroiidone, sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium suSfosuccinate, or any combination thereof. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated by techniques known to the person skilled in the art, such as the techniques published in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20\nth\n Edition. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated as dosage forms for oral, parenteral, such as intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intradermal, intraarterial, rectal, nasal, topical, aerosol or vaginal administration.

In particular, the compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions may be administered oraliy or by inhalation. It is particularly preferred that the compounds of the present invention are administered by pulmonary administration, in particular by inhalation, in the form of dry powder formulations as described e.g. in more detail herein below. \n\n\nIf the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenterally, then examples of such administration include one or more of: intravenously, intraarteriai!y, intraperitoneal, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously administering the compounds pharmaceutical compositions, and/or by using infusion techniques. For parenteral administration, the compounds are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions can also be administered orally in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavoring or coloring agents, for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or controlled-release applications. The tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disint eg rants such as starch (preferably com, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylceilulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, \n\n starch, a cellulose, miik sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the agent may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanot, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof. \n\n\nAlternatively, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or it may be applied topically in the form of a gel, hydrogel, lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the present invention may also be derma!ly or transdermal administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. \n\n\nThe compounds or pharmaceutical compositions may also be administered by the pulmonary route, rectal routes, or the ocular route. For ophthalmic use, they can be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum. \n\n\nIt is furthermore envisaged to prepare dry powder formulations of the compounds of the present invention for pulmonary administration. The dry powder formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be delivered using any suitable dry powder inhaler (DPI), i.e., an inhaler device that utilizes the patient's inhaled breath as a vehicle to transport the dry powder drug to the lungs. \n\n\nFor topical application to the skin, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propyiene glycol, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. \n\n\nTypically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular individual subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, \n\n rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual subject undergoing therapy. \n\n\nA proposed, yet non-limiting dose of the compounds of the invention, including the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (III), for administration to a human (of approximateiy 70 kg body weight) may be 0.1 pg to 10 g, preferably 0.1 mg to 1 g, and more preferably about 200 mg or more (e.g., 200 to 300 mg or 200 to 500 mg), of the active ingredient per unit dose. The unit dose may be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per week. The dose will depend on the route of administration. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and weight of the patient/subject as well as the severity of the condition to be treated. The precise dose and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. in one embodiment, the compounds according to the present invention can be used in combination with other therapeutic agents. When the compound is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease, the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. The combination of a compound of this invention with (an) other drug(s) may comprise the administration of the drug(s) with the compound of the invention.

Further antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody constructs and/or modified antibodies to be used in co-therapy approaches with the compounds of the invention can be found in: Taylor et a!., Antibody therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, Curr Opin Pharmacol, 2003, 3(3), 323-328; or Roxana et al., Maedica, 2006, 1 (1 ), 63-65. \n\n\nThe combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formuiation. The individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously/concomitantly in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations by any convenient route. When administration is sequential, either the present compound or the second therapeutic agent may be administered first. When administration is simultaneous, the combination may be administered either in the same or different pharmaceutical composition. When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the formulation. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient formulation, conveniently in such manner as are known for such compounds in the art. \n\n\nIn another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with physical therapy, such as radiotherapy. Radiotherapy may commence before, after, or simultaneously with administration of the compounds. For example, radiotherapy may commence 1 to 10 minutes, 1 to 10 hours or 24 to 72 hours after administration of the compounds. Yet, these time frames are not to be construed as limiting. The subject is exposed to radiation, preferably gamma radiation, whereby the radiation may be provided in a single dose or in multiple doses that are administered over several hours, days and/or weeks. Gamma radiation may be delivered according to standard radiotherapeutic protocols using standard dosages and regimens. Without being bound by theory, the compounds of the present invention may be used to render cells, in particular undesired protiferative/hyperpro!iferative ceils like cancer or tumor cells, more susceptible to such a physical therapy, e.g. radiotherapy. \n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention relates to a compounds of formula (I), (il) or (III) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the aforementioned entities in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, for use in the treatment or prevention of cancer, whereby the compound or the pharmaceutical composition is to be administered in \n\n combination with an anti-proliferative drug, an anticancer drug, a cytostatic drug, a cytotoxic drug and/or radiotherapy. \n\n\nFurthermore, it is particularly envisaged to use the combination therapy as described herein above for the treatment or prevention of multidrug-resistant cancer, including the specific multidrug-resistant cancers described above. \n\n\nThe subject or patient, such as the subject in need of treatment or prevention, may be an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), a murine (e.g. a mouse), a canine (e.g. a dog), a feline (e.g. a cat), an equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, a simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. a marmoset, a baboon), an ape (e. g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human. The meaning of the terms \"animal\", \"mammal\", etc. is well known in the art and can, for example, be deduced from Wehner und Gehring (1995; Thieme Verlag). In the context of this invention, it is particularly envisaged that animals are to be treated which are economically, agronomically or scientifically important. Scientifically important organisms include, but are not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, fruit flies like Drosophila melagonaster and nematodes like Caenorhabditis elegans. Non-limiting examples of agronomically important animals are sheep, cattle and pig, whiie, for example, cats and dogs may be considered as economically important animals. Preferably, the subject/patient is a mammal. More preferably, the subject/patient is a human. \n\n\nThe term \"treatment of a disorder or disease\" as used herein, e.g., in the case of the treatment of cancer, is well known in the art. \"Treatment of a disorder or disease\" implies that a disorder or disease has been diagnosed in a patient/subject. A patient/subject suspected of suffering from a disorder or disease typically shows specific clinical and/or pathological symptoms which a skilled person can easily attribute to a specific pathological condition (i.e. make a diagnosis of a disorder or disease). \"Treatment of a disorder or disease\" may, for example, !ead to a halt in the progression of the disorder or disease (e.g., no deterioration of symptoms) or a delay in the progression of the disorder or disease (in case the halt in progression is of a transient nature only). \"Treatment of a disorder or disease\" may also lead to a partial response (e.g., ameiioration of symptoms) or complete response (e.g., disappearance of symptoms) of the subject/patient suffering from the disorder or disease. \"Amelioration\" of a disorder or disease may, for example, lead to a halt in the progression of the disorder or disease or a delay in the progression of the disorder or disease. Such a partial or complete response may be followed by a relapse, it is to be \n\n understood that a subject/patient may experience a broad range of responses to a treatment (e.g., the exemplary responses as described herein above). \n\n\nTreatment of a disorder or disease may, inter alia, comprise curative treatment (preferably leading to a complete response and eventually to healing of the disorder or disease) and palliative treatment {including symptomatic relief). \n\n\nAlso the term \"prevention of a disorder or disease\" as used herein, e.g., in the case of the prevention of cancer, is well known in the art. For example, a patient/subject suspected of being prone to suffer from a disorder or disease as defined herein may, in particular, benefit from a prevention of the disorder or disease. The subject/patient may have a susceptibility or predisposition for a disorder or disease, including but not limited to hereditary predisposition. Such a predisposition can be determined by standard assays, using, for example, genetic markers or phenotypic indicators. It is to be understood that a disorder or disease to be prevented in accordance with the present invention has not been diagnosed or cannot be diagnosed in the patient/subject (for example, the patient/subject does not show any clinical or pathological symptoms). Thus, the term \"prevention\" comprises the use of compounds of the present invention before any clinical and/or pathological symptoms are diagnosed or determined or can be diagnosed or determined by the attending physician. \n\n\nIn this specification, a number of documents including patent applications and manufacturer's manuals are cited. The disclosure of these documents, while not considered relevant for the patentability of this invention, is herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Concentrations as high as 10 mM could be achieved thus demonstrating the good solubility. Customarily, in vivo applications to animals require only concentrations up to 3 mM. In order to check the chemical stability of such solutions of 5b they were stored for one month and subsequently used in in vitro tests alongside freshly prepared solutions of the same concentrations of 5b. Analysis of tubulin polymerization was performed using the Tubulin Polymerization Assay Kit (Cytoskeieton, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The assay is fluorescence- based and tubulin polymerization was followed by measuring RFU (relative fluorescence units) on the SpectraFluorPlus (Tecan, Switzerland) using the following filters: excitation 360 nm, emission 465 nm. \n\n\nThe cytotoxic activity of 5b was established by standard colorimetric tests (SRB- and MTT- assays) against various tumor cell lines of different entities. For the SRB cytotoxicity assay, dose-response curves of the testicular germ cell tumor cell lines exposed to drug concentrations of 0.001-10 μΜ were established using the sulforhodamine-B (SRB) microculture colorimetric assay (Papazisis et al. Optimization of the sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay. J, Immunol. Methods 1997, 208, 151 -158) and performed as described in: Muller et al. Failure of activation of caspase-9 induces a higher threshold for apoptosts and \n\n cispiatirt resistance in testicular cancer. Cancer Res. 2003, 63, 513-521 , Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-weil plates on day 0, at cell densities previously determined to ensure exponential cell growth during the period of the experiment. On day 1 , ceils were treated with the drugs dissolved in medium to give the appropriate concentrations for indicated times and the percentage of surviving cells relative to untreated controls was determined on day 5. \n\n\nThe assays for inhibition of the polymerization of tubulin and for the cytotoxicities revealed high, unattenuated activity and efficacy of 5b, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Unlike cisplatin, compound 5b showed similar in vitro activity against the two germ cell tumor cell lines H12.1 and 141 1 HP with IC\n50\n{96 h) = 30-50 nM, i.e., it overcame the chemoresistance of the 141 1 HP ceiis (Figure 3A). This suggests that compound 5b operates by a differential mechanism of action, initiating growth inhibition and ceil death aiso in multidrug resistant tumor cells. Comparable results can be obtained, e.g., with compound 6b according to the invention (Figure 3B). \n\n\nIn vivo antitumor activity and tolerability of compounds 5b and 6b of the invention were studied in a nude mouse xenograft model of the resistant germ cell tumor cell line 141 1 HP employing Athymic Nude-Fox n1 nu/nu mice (Harlan und Winkeimann, Borchen, Germany). \n\n\nPrior to testing compound 5b, healthy animals of this type were treated with an ascending range of doses of 5b in order to establish a toxicity profile. The compound was very well tolerated by the mice even at relatively high concentrations. Suitable dosages were then administered In further tests in a nude mouse xenograft model of a pair of germ cell tumor cell lines, the chemoresistant cell line 1411 HP and the chemosensitive cell line H12.1. These ceil lines retain their individual in vitro chemosensitivities to cisplatin when grown as xenograft tumors and so may serve as a model of the clinical situation of resistance to chemotherapy (Mueller et al. Cancer Res. 2003; Mueller et al. Tumor Biol. 2006). While treatment of H12.1 xenograft bearing mice with cisplatin led to complete regressions, 141 1 HP xenografts suffered only a transient growth inhibition followed by renewed tumor progress. \n\n\nThe tests were carried out as follows. The mice were kept under pathogen-free conditions, fed on an autoclaved standard diet and given free access to sterilized water. Each of five mice were administered a 150 μ1_ phosphate buffered saline suspension of 10 million 141 1 HP cells into the left flank to generate subcutaneous xenograft tumors. After 4 weeks one group of two mice bearing 141 1 HP xenografts with a volume of ca. 1 cm\n3\n were injected \n\n i.p. with a single dose of 30 mg/kg body weight of 5b or 6b, respectively. Two mice in the second group with xenografts of a volume of ca. 2.5 cm\n3\n were injected i.p. with 20 mg/kg body weight of 5b on two consecutive days. Tumor volumes were calculated by caliper measurement using the formula a\n2\n * b * 0.5 with a being the short and b the Song dimension. Body weight was assessed twice weekly and daily while under therapy. \n\n\nAfter the two mice bearing 141 1 HP xenografts with a volume of about 1 cm\n3\n were treated with a single dose of 30 mg/kg body weight of 5b or 6b, in either case a strong intra-tumoral hemorrhage became visible yet after 24 h as a red-b!ue to brown coloring, as shown in Figure 5 for treatment with 5b. Also visible was a transient swelling of the tumors, eventually followed by regression and slow regrowth, as shown in Figure 4 A. Both mice tolerated this treatment very well. A prolonged period of tumor shrinkage was achieved in the two mice bearing 1411 HP xenografts of about 2.5 cm\n3\n volume by administration of 20 mg/kg body weight of 5b on two consecutive days. The resulting dramatic tumor regressions, leading even to a stabilization in one case, are shown in Figures 4 B/C. The other xenograft regrew and was given two further double doses of 5b on days 16/17 and 35/36. As shown in Figure 4 C, regressions and prolonged periods of stabilization following each of the three applications were achieved. Notably, even the third course of treatment was well tolerated and the mouse had regained its original body weight by this time. These data demonstrate the great potential of the compounds 5b and 6b for an efficient curative treatment of resistant tumors. \n\n\nIn the mouse model anti-tumor activity of 5b thus became apparent by a dramatic regression of the resistant tumors (Figure 4). The strong vascular disrupting effect selectively affecting the tumoral vasculature was demonstrated and visualized by a distinct intra-tumoral hemorrhage occurring 24 h after administration of the compound 5b (Figure 5). In addition, a single dose application of compound 5b was sufficient to stabilize the tumor volume for about two weeks. Furthermore, a tumor regression trial using dual-dose i. p. application of 2x20mg/kg body weight of compound 6b in 141 1 HP germ cell tumor xenograft showed high antitumor activity to a similar extent as compound 6b, as also shown in Figure 10. \n\n\nFrom these findings it can be concluded that the compounds of formula (I), such as, e.g., compound 5b or 6b, represent a class of effectives suitable for the treatment of multi- resistant tumors. Their hallmark is the synergistic combination of high cancer ce!l-specific \n\n cytotoxicity based upon a genuine mechanism, a tumor-selective vascular disrupting effect, favourable pharmacological properties, and excellent tolerance in vivo. \n\n\nThe compounds 5f, 6b and 6f were further tested for vascular disrupting effect in the 141 1 HP xenograft model, and the compounds 5b, 5f, 6b and 6f were additionally tested in a second tumor model of A2780 ovarian carcinoma xenografts, showtng vascular disrupting activity of all compounds in both models (Figure 1 1 ), which suggests a general activity of the compounds of the invention in well vascularized tumors. Compounds 5b, 6b and 6f were also tested in terms of feasibility of oral administration. Mice received a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight of 5b, 6b or 6f, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed. Then compounds 6b or 6f were given peroral as dual-dose application on two consecutive days in accordance to the i.p. treatment scheme used for the regression trials but with a 2-fold higher dose of 2x40mg/kg body weight. This was well tolerated and induced only a transient and marginal loss of body weight in case of 6b whereas no signs of toxicity were observed for 6f. In addition 6f was administered as single dose of 60 mg/kg body weight and again was tolerated symptom-free. This demonstrates the outstanding toxicity profile of the compounds of the present invention when given peroral even at higher doses. \n\n\nTo prove whether the tumor targeted cytotoxic activity is also achieved after an oral administration of compounds of the invention, the vascular disrupting effect was studied 24h after giving 60mg/kg body weight of compound 6b peroral. No signs of toxicity were observed. The vascular disrupting effect occurred to same extent as seen after i.p. application, as also shown in Figure 12. \n\n\nExample 4: Cell growth inhibition assay in various human tumor cell lines \n\n\nThe effects of the compounds 5b, 6b, 8a, and 8e according to the present invention and of the reference compound 25f (Wang et aL, J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 1697-171 1 ) on cells of the following human tumor cell lines were evaluated: 518A2 melanoma, HL-60 leukemia, HT- 29 colon carcinoma, KB-V1/Vbl cervical carcinoma, and MCF-7/Topo breast carcinoma. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HL-60 cells were obtained from the German Collection of Biological Material (DS Z), Braunschweig, Germany; the human 518A2 melanoma cells as well as the testicular germ cell tumor eel! lines H12.1 and 1411 HP were cultured in the department of onco!ogy and hematology, Medical Faculty of the Martin-Luther University, Halie, Germany; the KBV1/Vbl and the MCF-7/Topo cells were obtained from the Institute of Pharmacy of the University Regensburg, Germany; and the colon HT-29 cells from the University Hospital Erlangen, Germany. The HL-60 and the HT-29 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 lU/mL penicillin G, 100 pg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 pg/mL amphotericin B and 250 pg/mL geniamycine (all from Gibco, Egenstein, Germany). The 518A2 and the KB-V1/Vbl cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM, Gibco) containing 10% FCS, 100 lU/mL penicillin G, 100 pg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 0,25 pg/mL amphotericin B and 250 pg/mL gentamycine. The MCF-7/Topo cells were grown in E-MEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2 g/L NaHC03, 1 0 mg/L sodium pyruvate and 5% FCS. The cells were maintained in a moisture- saturated atmosphere (5% C0\n2\n) at 37 °C in 75-mL culture flasks (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). They were serially passaged following trypsinisation by 0.05% trypsin / 0.02% EDTA (PAA laboratories, Colbe, Germany). Mycoplasma contamination was routinely monitored, and only mycoplasma-free cultures were used. \n\n\nMTT [3-(4,5-dimethy!thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dipheny!tetrazolium bromide] (ABCR) was used to identify viable ceils which reduce it to a violet formazan (Mosmann, J. Immunol, Methods 1983, 65, 55-63). HL-60 leukemia cells (5x 0\n5\n/mL), and cells (5x10\n4\n/mL) of 518A2 melanoma, HT-29 colon, KB-VWbl cervix and MCF-7/Topo breast carcinoma were seeded out in 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 24 h. Incubation (5% CC½, 95% humidity, 37°C) of the cells following treatment with the test compounds was continued for 24, 48 or 72 h. Blank and solvent controls were treated identically. MTT in phosphate buffered saline (5 mg/mL) was added to a final concentration of 0.05% (HL-60, 518A2) or 0.1 % (HT-29, KB- V1 Vbl, MCF-7/Topo). After 2 h the formazan precipitate was dissolved in 10% sodium \n\n dodecylsulfate in DMSO containing 0.6% acetic acid in the case of the HL-60 cel!s. For the adherent 518A2, KB-V1/Vbi, CF-7/Topo and HT-29 ce!ls the micropiates were swiftiy turned to discard the medium before adding the solvent mixture. The micropiates were gently shaken in the dark for 30 min and absorbance at 570 nm and 630 nm (background) was measured with an ELISA plate reader. AN experiments were carried out in quadruplicate; the percentage of viable cells was calculated as the mean ± SD with controls set to 100%. \n\n\nAs shown in Figure 6A, the halo-amino substituted imidazoles 5b and 6b were distinctly more cytotoxic than the known reference compound 25f at iC\n5\no concentrations in the single- digit nanomolar range, even in the combretastatin A-4 resistant HT-29 cells and the Pgp- overexpressing KB-V1 cells. Only in the MCF-7/Topo cells they were noticeably less active but still superior to the known imidazole 25f. \n\n\nIn contrast, the diamino substituted oxazole 8a and its imidazole counterpart 8e were more cell line specific with greater efficacy than 25f and 5b/6b against both multidrug-resistant cells, i.e., KB-V1/Vbl (Pgp+) and MCF-7/Topo (BCRP÷). This is a hint at potentially different or additional modes of action of these compounds. \n\n\nMoreover, as shown in Figure 7, combretastatin A-4 shows lower cytotoxicities than compounds 5b and 6b in the multi-drug resistant HT-29 colon cancer cells. Hence, compounds 5b and 6b are able to overcome the drug resistance in these cancer cells in vitro. \n\n\nThe compounds 5b, 6b, 5f and 6f as well as the reference compound 25f (Wang et al.) were furthermore subjected to an SRB -cytotoxicity assay in a panel of tumor cell lines (H12.1 germ cell tumor, 141 1 HP germ ceil tumor, A2780 ovarian carcinoma, HT29 colon carcinoma, DLD1 colon carcinoma, HCT8 colon carcinoma). As shown in Figure 3, compounds 5b and 6b showed superior activity as compared to compound 25f, and a further improvement of cytotoxicity was observed for the compounds 5f and 6f. \n\n\nThe compounds 9a, 9b and 9c, which are exemplary compounds of formula (ill) according to the present invention, as weil as the reference compound 25f were tested in a similar manner. As indicated in Table 1 , compounds 9a, 9b and 9c showed a more pronounced and selective cytotoxic effect on tumor cells (L929 fibroblasts, KB-3-1 cervix carcinoma, and PC-3 prostata cancer) than on non-malign cells (PtK-2 opossum kidney cells and NHDF fibroblasts) as well as an improved effect (MIC) on HUVEC cells as compared to the reference compound 25f. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 : IC50 (nM) in L929 fibroblasts, KB-3-1 cervix carcinoma, PC-3 prostata cancer, \n\n\n PtK-2 opossum kidney ce!ls and NHDF fibroblasts, and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (nM) in HUVEC cells. \n\n\nExample 5: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation assay \n\n\nThe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells is a sign of cellular stress resulting in severe damage of cellular components such as DNA, lipids or proteins. The amount of ROS produced in HL-60 and in 518A2 cells treated with the reference compound 25f or a compound according to the invention was assessed using the colorimetric nitroblue- tetrazolium (NBT) assay (Rook et al. J. Immunol. Methods 1985, 82, 161-167). The ROS generation (% NBT reduction) was determined from percent absorbance of formazan relative to untreated controls (1 %) after 24 h exposure of 518A2 and HL-60 cells to 50 μΜ of the test compounds. For the NBT assay, HL-60 cells (0.5'10\n6\n/mL) were plated in 96-weli tissue culture plates, and test compounds were added after 24 h incubation at 37 °C to achieve a finai concentration of 50 μΜ. Incubation (5% C0\n2\n, 95% humidity, 37°C) of cells following treatment with the test compounds was continued for 24 h. After removal of the cell medium by centrifugation, the cells in each well were resuspended in 100 pL 0.1 % NBT, and the plates were placed in the incubator for 1 h. The reduced NBT was solubilized with 100 μΙ 2 M KOH and 130 pi DMSO for 30 min. The absorbance was measured for each well at 630 and 405 nm (background) using an ELISA plate reader. The adherent 518A2 cells (0.5- 0\n4\n/mL) were seeded out in 96- weil tissue culture plates after trypsinization and incubation for 24 h at 37 °C to allow attachment, then treated similarly, only that the medium was removed prior to incubation with NBT for 4 h. All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate. \n\n The following results were obtained, the indicated values representing means of four independent experiments ± standard deviation; \n\n\nNBT Reduction [%] NBT Reduction [%] \n\n\n in 518A2 cells after 24 h in HL-60 cells after 24 h \n\n\n 25f 2.2 ± 0.4 1.5 ± 0.1 \n\n\n 5b 1.8 ± 0.2 4.4 ± 0.6 \n\n\n 5c 1.6 ± 0.1 4.8 ± 0.5 \n\n\n 5d 2.4 ± 0.4 6.0 ± 0.9 \n\n\n 6b 1.5 ± 0.2 3.8 ± 0.3 \n\n\n 6c 1.4 ± 0.3 3.9 ± 0.1 \n\n\n 6d 1.6 ± 0.3 6.7 ± 0.8 \n\n\n 8a 1.5 ± 0.1 3.5 + 0.4 \n\n\n 8b 1.4 ± 0.3 3.3 ± 0.2 \n\n\n 8c 1.1 ± 0.0 1.8 ± 0.3 \n\n\n 8d 1.2 ± 0.1 1.4 ± 0.2 \n\n\n 8e 1.6 + 0.3 6.4 ± 0.3 The weakly cytotoxic compound 25f led to a low ROS level, while, e.g., the highly cytotoxic compound 5b according to the invention afforded an ROS ievei of 4.4 %. \n\n\nExample 6: Mitochondrial membrane assay \n\n\nThe extent of apoptosis-reiated mitochondrial damage in 518A2 and HL-60 cells was ascertained by means of the fluorescence dye JC-1 that detects changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Desager et aS. J. Cell. Biol. 1999, 144, 891-901 ). The ratio of red to green fluorescence relative to untreated controls (100%) after 72 h exposure of 518A2 and HL-60 ceils to 5 μΜ of the test compounds (i.e., compounds according to the invention or reference compound 25f) was determined with the Mitochondrial Membrane Detection Kit (Stratagene, La Jotla, CA, USA). Values represent means of four independent experiments ± standard deviation. \n\n\nChanges in mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by the Mitochondrial Membrane Detection Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's procedure. 72 h following treatment with 5 μΜ of the test compounds, cell samples were \n\n centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μ!_ diluted JC-1 solution, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (HL-60) and then centrifuged again for 5 min at 400 g. After washing, the peilets were resuspended in 100 pL PBS and transferred into the wells of a black 96-well plate. The red (A\nex\n = 585 nm, K\nem\n = 590 nm) and green (A\nex\n = 510 nm, A\nem\n = 527 nm) fluorescence intensities were measured and their ratio was calculated. \n\n\nAgain, the impact of the test compounds was more diverse and specific in the HL-60 leukemia cells: intact mitochondria [%] Intact mitochondria [%] \n\n\n in 518A2 cells after 72 h in HL-60 ceils after 72 h \n\n\n 25f 87 ± 7 74 ± 13 \n\n\n 5b 80 ± 9 65 ± 9 \n\n\n 5c 84 ± 6 55 ± 7 \n\n\n 5d 80 ± 7 61 ± 13 \n\n\n 6b 80 ± 9 66 ± 10 \n\n\n 6c 89 ± 10 60 ± 15 \n\n\n 6d 82 ± 7 63 ± 13 \n\n\n 8a 85 ± 7 62 ± 9 \n\n\n 8b 82 ± 8 62 ± 12 \n\n\n 8c 94 ± 7 76 ± 19 \n\n\n 8d 98 ± 15 90 ± 22 \n\n\n 8e 77 ± 8 60 ± 15 \n\n\nHere, only about 65% of the mitochondria were intact after incubation with the more cytotoxic compound 5b, while treatment with 25f left more mitochondria unaffected (74%). \n\n\nExample 7: TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labelling (TUNEL) assay \n\n\n!n TUNEL assays, which allow the detection of apoptosis by iabel!ing the 3'-OH ends of DNA fragments with fiuorescein-tagged nucleotides, the compounds 5b, 6b and 8a were found to induce death in HL-60 cells predominantly in an apoptotic way (about 60% after 16 h incubation with 10 μΜ drug). The extent of apoptosis-related mitochondrial damage in HL-60 cells was ascertained by means of the fluorescence dye JC-1 that detects changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Desager et a!., J. Cell. Biol. 1999, 144, 891-901 ). Only about 60% of the mitochondria were intact after incubation with the more cytotoxic \n\n compounds 5b-d, 6b-d and 8a/e, while treatment with reference compound 25f left 74% of the mitochondria unaffected. Microscopic images of HL-60 cells tested in TUN EL assays after incubation with the compound 5b, 6b or 8a are shown in Figure 8. A modification of the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labelling (TUNEL; Roche) assay described by Jobmann was used (Jobmann, M. Apoptose bei struktureiien Herzmuske!erkrankungen. Ph.D. Thesis, University Marburg, Germany 2002, 31 ). HL-60 ceils were incubated with the test compounds for 16 h, aliquots of 3 x 10\n6\n cells were withdrawn and washed/centrifuged 3 times in 200 pL PBS. The cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature by suspending in 200 pL of a freshly prepared solution of 2% formalin in PBS, After washing with 2 x 200 pL PBS, 10 pL of the cell suspension was applied onto a microscope slide and air-dried at room temperature. The ceils were washed by covering with PBS for 5 min and treated for 2 min with a solution of 0.1 % Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate on ice. After washing two times with PBS, 10 pL of the freshly prepared TUNEL reaction mixture, consisting of 1 pL TUNEL-Enzyme solution and 9 pL TUNEL-Label solution, was dropped on the cells which were then covered and incubated (5% C0\n2\n, 95% humidity) in the dark at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then analysed by fluorescence microscopy at an excitation wavelength of 450-500 nm. The percentage of apoptotic, TUNEL-posttive, green-stained cells was counted and calculated for 300 cells and expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. \n\n\nExample 8: CAM assay Compounds of the present invention were tested for anti-angiogenic and vasculature disrupting properties using the CAM assay. In this test the vascular system of a fertilized chicken embryo is used as a model (Wilting et a!., Anat. Embryol. 1991 , 183, 259-271 ). \n\n\nFertilized chicken eggs received from a nearby farm directly after laying have been incubated at a temperature of 36-38 °C and a relative humidity of 60%. During the growth the eggs have been held in an inclined position and turned from time to time in order to avoid an adherence to the shell. After four days each embryo was transferred into a cavity created by fixing a thin plastic foil on top of a cup and covered. This was done by opening the shell at the flat end where the air sac resides and letting the content slip out. There the growth continued for another 2-4 days until the first blood vessels became visible. Then 10 nmol of the substance to be tested (in 10 pL PBS with 1 % DMF) have been applied directly on the embryonal vessels. As a reference PBS was used. Finally incubation continued for up to \n\n another three days (Dugan et al., Anat Rec. 1991 , 229, 125-128; Fisher, Tested studies for laboratory teaching 1993, 5, 105-1 15). \n\n\nIn Figure 9 the effects of the compounds CA-4 (reference) and 5b on the development of embryonal blood vessels compared to a negative control (PBS) are shown. Like CA-4, compound 5b led to a dramatic vessel shrinkage within 24 h after treatment and to a complete degradation of the vascular system within three days. \n\n\nExample 9: Tube formation assay \n\n\nThe effect of the compounds 5b, 6b and 8a according to the invention as well as reference compound 25f (Wang et al., J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 1697-1711 ) on capillary tube formation in HUVEC cells on matrigel has been determined in order to further evaluate the anti- angiogenic properties of these compounds (the structures of the compounds employed are shown in Example 4). \n\n\n35 μ!_ of media : matrigel (1 :1 ) were added into wells of a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. A trypsinized HUVEC cell suspension was set to 800.000 ceils/mL. In another 96-well plate 25 μΙ_ of the compound stock were serially diluted with 25 μΙ_ of media. 25 μΙ_ of compound dilutions and 25 μ!_ of cell suspension were added to the matrigel coated 96-well plate and the cells were incubated over night. As a negative control, methanol was used as in place of the compound dilutions. Compounds 6b and 8a showed pronounced inhibition of tube formation by HUVEC cells at very low concentrations (7.72 ng/mL), while compound 5b did not yield a correspondingly strong inhibition at this concentration, as also shown in Figure 14. Compounds 6b and 8a were distinctly more active than the known compound 25f, which inhibits tube formation at a much higher concentration (130 ng/mL). \n\n\nExample 10: High-content analyses \n\n\nAutomatic microscopy based cluster analyses (High-Content Analyses, HCA) of the compounds 6b and 8a in PtK-2 cells revealed a close relationship to the known tubulin binder vinblastine for compound 6b and to the known PI3- inase inhibitor LY294002 for compound 8a. Results are shown in Figure 15. \n\n Instrumentation: ImageXpress Micro (IXM) High-Speed Laser Autofocus Digital CCD-camera \n\n\n 300 Watt Xenon arc lamp \n\n\n Filter Sets: - DAPI \n\n\n - FSTC \n\n\n .
