They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTM1) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPC1 (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC 7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3 or TRPV4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRPV3 and is more closely related to TRPVl and TRPV2 than to TRPV5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPMl (melastatin or LTRPC1), TRPM3 (KIAA1616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMR1), TRPM5 (MTR1 or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPML1 (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPPl (PKDl, PCI), PKD-REJ and PKD-lLl are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTM1. \n\n It is believed TRPAl is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPAl is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice.TRPAl is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17Â°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson, L. J. et al., Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAl ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAl receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAl is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals\n\n\nThe difference between TRPAl and other TRP receptors is that TRPAl ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required. \n\n\n WO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions. \n\n\n In efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPAl . \n\n\n Summary of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I): \n\n\n O \n\n\n Q-CH\n2\n C-NH-U-V \n\n\n (I) \n\n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, \n\n\nwherein, Q is a heterocycle selected from the group consisting of \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nU is selected from -(CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\n-, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycles selected from the group consisting of thiazole, isothiazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiadiazole, oxadiazole, pyrazole, imidazole, furan, thiophene, pyrroles, 1,2,3-triazoles and 1, 2, 4-triazole, pyrimidine, pyridine and pyridazine; \n\n V is selected from hydrogen, cyano, nitro, -NR\nx\nR\ny\n, halogen, hydroxyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyl, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cycloalkylalkoxy, aryl, arylalkyl, biaryl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyi, heterocyclic ring and heterocyclylalkyl, -C(0)OR , -OR\nx\n, -C(0)NR\nx\nR\ny\n, -C(0)R\nx\n and -S0\n2\nNR\nx\nR\ny\n; or \n\n\n at each occurrence, R\n1\n, R\n2\n and R\n3\n, which may be the same or different, are independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, (CR\nx\nR\ny\n)âOR\nx\n, COR\", COOR\nx\n, CONR\nx\nR\ny\n,and (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCHR\nx\nR\ny\n; \n\n\n R\n4\n is halogen; \n\n\n at each occurrence, R\nx\n and R\ny\n are independently selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyi, heterocyclic ring and heterocyclylalkyl; \n\n\n at each occurrence, 'n' is selected from 0 to 2, both inclusive. \n\n\n The embodiments below are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments exemplified. \n\n\n According to one embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (la) \n\n\n\n\n\n (la) \n\n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, \n\n\n wherein, \n\n\n R\n1\n, U and V are as defined above in formula (I) \n\n\n According to another embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (la) wherein R\n1\n is alkyl preferably methyl. \n\n\n According to another embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (la) wehrein 'LP is five membered heterocycle, preferably thiazole. \n\n\n According to yet another embodiment, specifically provided are compounds of the formula (la) wherein 'V is substituted or unsubstituted aryl, preferably phenyl.

Digestive organ diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, functional dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting. The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPAl is illustrated, for example, in Story, G. M. et al. Cell, 2003, 1 12, 819-829; McMahon, S.B. and Wood, J. N., Cell, 2006, 124, 1 123-1125; Voorhoeve, P. M. et al. Cell, 2006, 124, 1169-1181; Wissenbach, U, Niemeyer, B. A. and Flockerzi, V. Biology of the Cell, 2004, 96, 47-54; and the references cited therein. \n\n\n Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett & F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed., 1996, 100-107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as \"nociceptors\". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and ÎÎ´ fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal and proton (pH<6) modalities. Nociceptors are the nerves which sense and respond to parts of the body which suffer from damage. They signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain. \n\n\n Chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited). \n\n\nGeneral Methods of Preparation \n\n The compounds described herein, including compounds of general (I), (Ia)-(Ig) and (Ila)-(IIg) and specific examples, can be prepared by techniques known to in the art, for example, through the reaction scheme depicted in Scheme 1-19.

Hydrolysis of ester of formula (41) with aqueous acid gives compounds of the formula (42). The coupling of compounds of formula (42) with an amine of formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ig). \n\n\n Scheme 12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (41) (42) (Ig) \n\n\nThe alternative synthesis of key intermediate (37) is depicted in scheme 13.

In this approach N-alkyl cyanoacetamide (45) is coupled with an imido ester hydrochloride of formula (35) in presence of a suitable base such as triethyl amine in a suitable solvent to give aminoacrylonitrile derivative (46). Intermediate (46) is then reacted with hydroxyl amine under basic conditions to furnish the desired amino isoxazole intermediates (39). \n\n\n Scheme 14 \n\n\n\n\n\n (45) (46) (39)\n\n\nAnother approach for the synthesis of isoxazolo[5,4-i/]pyrimidinyl acetic acid of the formula (42) is as shown in scheme 15. Thus, reaction of commercially available 1,3- dialkylbarbituric acid of the formula (23) with malonic acid (47) in the presence of suitable solvent gives compounds of the formula (48). Posner reaction of (48) by using hydroxy lamine hydrochloride in the presence of suitable base gives isoxazole [3,4-\n\n\n< ]pyrimidinyl acetic acid of the formula (42) (Posner, T. et. al. Chem.

Certain di-and tri-substituted acetophenones were not commercially available and they were prepared from the corresponding benzoic acid derivative of formula (49) in three steps. Thus, acid of formula (49) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (50) using \n\n oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. The acid chloride of formula (50) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula\n\n\n(52) by treating with N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride of formula (51) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of alkyl magnesium iodide (R\n5\n is hydrogen or alkyl) to Weinreb amide of formula (52) afforded acetophenone derivative of formula (53). \n\n\n Conversion of acetophenone derivative of formula (53) to 2-amino-4-substituted aryl thiazole of the formula (54) can be effected by two approaches as described in Scheme 16. In the first case acetophenone was converted to the corresponding phenacyl bromide, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. Alternatively, acetophenone derivative of formula\n\n\n(53) can be converted to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole (54) in one step by its reaction with thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanol (Carroll, K. et al, J.

The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with saturated solution of sodium thiosulphate. The organic layer was treated with IN HCl and the precipitated salt was collected by filtration. The salt was then treated with saturated solution of NaHC0\n3\n and extracted with dichloromethane, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated to afford the 2-aminothiazole derivative. \n\n\n Step 2: To a stirred and cooled (0Â°C) solution of appropriate amine (1.0 equiv.) and pyridine (1.2 equiv.) in dichloromethane (5 vol.) was added bromoacetyl bromide (1.2 eq.) over 5 min and the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring for 2 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and water. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane and the combined organic layers were washed with water, followed by brine, dried (Na\n2\nS0\n4\n) and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue obtained after the evaporation of the solvent was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 5-10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether to obtain the desired product as an off-white solid. \n\n\n Structure information and characterization data for selected 2-bromo-N-thiazolyl acetamide intermediates are given in Table 2. \n\n\n Table 2: Structural details and 1H NMR data of selected 2-bromo-N-thiazolyl acetamides \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further illustration of methods of preparing the compounds of the present invention, the following examples are disclosed below. \n\n\n Example 1 \n\n\n N-[4-(4-Difluoromethoxy-3,5-difluorophenyl)-l,3-thiazol-2-yl]-2-(3-methyl-2,4-dioxo- 3,4-dihydro-2H-[l,3]thiazoIo[3,2- ]triazin-6-yl)acetamide \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To a magnetically stirred solution of Intermediate 1, (80 mg, 0.332 mmol) in a mixture of DMF (2.0 ml) and THF (2.0 ml), were added 4-[4-(difluoromethoxy)-3,5- difluorophenyl]-l,3-thiazol-2-amine (92 mg, 0.332 mmol), EDCI (127 mg, 0.664 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (8.0 mg, 0.066 mmol) at 90 Â°C temperature and stirred for 18 h.

Life Sciences, 2003, 73, 487-498. (b) McNamara C, R. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2007, 104, 13525- 13530. The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art. \n\n\n Screening for TRPAl antagonist using the \n45\nCalcium uptake assay: \n\n\n The inhibition of TRPAl receptor activation was measured as inhibition of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium. \n\n\n Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n to get the desired concentration. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 Î¼g / ml of G-418. Rat TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 Î¼g / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 Î¼Î (for human TRPAl) and / or 10 Î¼Î (for rat TRPAl) and 5 Î¼Î¸Î¯/ÏÎ¹Î \n45\nCa\n+2\n for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant. (Toth et al, Life Sciences (2003) 73, 487-498; McNamara CR et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, (2007) 104 , 13525-13530). \n\n\n- I l l - \n\n Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. IC\n50\n values can be calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software. \n\n\n The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 3. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 Î¼Î and 10.0 Î¼Î are given in the table along with IC\n5\no (nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 3 wherein \"A\" refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM, \"B\" refers to IC\n50\n value in range of 50.01 to 100.0 nM and \"C\" refers to IC\n50\n value of more than 100.0 nM \n\n\nTable 3: In-vitro screening results of compounds of invention: \n\n\n \n\n 10.37 42.54 â ~ â â\n\n\n27.72 34.86 â ~ â â\n\n\n81.50 98.95 C â â â\n\n\n89.15 99.78 c â â \n\n\n 65.37 98.90 â â â â\n\n\n59.07 97.86 â â â â\n\n\n86.06 100.0 c â â â\n\n\n99.87 100.0 A 93.68 97.91 C\n\n\n75.30 99.66 c â â â\n\n\n94.46 99.9 A 80.02 98.54 c\n\n\n94.64 99.16 A 66.44 98.72 c\n\n\n98.92 98.87 A 92.55 100.0 B\n\n\n98.92 98.62 A 96.06 99.0 B\n\n\n69.21 96.83 - â â â\n\n\n69.17 99.37 - â â \n\n\n 60.10 98.80 - â â â\n\n\n90.94 99.66 C â â\n\n\n81.99 97.75 C â â â  â\n\n\n95.17 100.0 A 67.9 99.2 â\n\n\n94.78 99.73 B â â â\n\n\n95.50 99.76 B â â â\n\n\n72.44 99.59 C â â â Â·\n\n\n91.19 98.58 C â â â\n\n\n84.03 99.75 C â â â\n\n\n85.95 99.61 C â â â\n\n\n95.21 99.14 B â â â\n\n\n88.84 96.72 C ~ â â\n\n\n35.58 98.71 \nâ \n â ~ â â\n\n\n86.30 90.47 C â â ~\n\n\n86.33 99.78 c â â â\n\n\n90.42 99.87 c â â ...\n\n\n31.00 92.47 â â â â\n\n\n80.89 99.38 c â â â\n\n\n96.43 99.58 c â ~ â\n\n\n73.64 99.80 â â â \n\n\n 91.42 99.89 c â â â\n\n\n86.88 99.74 A â â â\n\n\n96.70 100.00 A â â C \n\n 89.03 99.79 C â â â\n\n\n93.84 99.62 C â â -\n\n\n92.26 99.32 C â â â\n\n\n94.18 99.60 A ~ â â\n\n\n92.92 99.84 C â â â\n\n\n94.93 98.76 C â â \n\n\n 67.15 99.41 â â â ~\n\n\n98.15 98. 48 A 99.69 99.73 A\n\n\n100 100 A 97.25 97.34 A\n\n\n100 100 B â â â\n\n\n100 100 A 95.54 97.26 A\n\n\n100 100 A 98.57 99.61 A\n\n\n100 100 A ~ â â\n\n\n100 99.85 A 99.9 99.74 A\n\n\n99.03 99.84 A 100.0 100.0 A\n\n\n99.97 99.77 A 100.0 100.0 A\n\n\n100 100 A 100.0 100.0 A\n\n\n99.88 99.59 A 100.0 100.0 A\n\n\n99.08 96.88 B 82.87 99.40 --\n\n\n96.84 98.83 B 86.85 91.36 -\n\n\n99.21 93.01 A 69.5 99.24 â\n\n\n92.60 99.86 B 94.24 100.0 C\n\n\n75.43 99.52 C 62.6 99.8 \n\n\n 81.89 97.83 C 92.28 100.0 C\n\n\n92.49 100.00 C 86.56 98.43 c\n\n\n65.88 94.45 - â â â\n\n\n68.27 94.37 C 79.98 100.0 c\n\n\n96.42 99.05 c â â â\n\n\n92.08 99.82 B 72.9 95.4 â\n\n\n93.49 97.56 C 96.33 100.0 c\n\n\n92.01 99.28 C 60.78 100.0 c\n\n\n94.71 99.59 A 79.74 100.0 c\n\n\n96.15 99.95 A 90.76 100.0 â\n\n\n97.81 99.61 A 44.3 99.6 â\n\n\n92.10 100.00 A 57.5 99.9 â\n\n\n97.64 99.80 A 98.38 99.32 B\n\n\n98.59 99.88 C 89.7 100.0 C\n\n\n98.93 99.97 C 92.77 99.27 ~ \n\n 98 98.29 100.00 C 100.0 98.99 ~\n\n\n99 98.67 100.00 C 97.93 99.88 C\n\n\n100 98.75 100.00 C 93.48 98.17 C\n\n\n101 98.89 100.00 C 97.78 99.88 c\n\n\n102 99.27 100.00 C 98.09 100.0 c\n\n\n103 99.89 100.00 C 95.03 96.83 c\n\n\n104 99.47 100.00 C 99.27 99.63 c\n\n\n105 1 1.44 68.50 ~ ~ â â\n\n\n106 0.00 9.95 â â â â\n\n\n107 1.21 18.74 â â â â\n\n\n108 0.97 4.35 â - â â â\n\n\n109 32.99 88.5 â â â â \n\n\nOral PK profile of Example 29 \n\n\n Test compound is formulated immediately prior to dosing by making a suspension\n\n\n(2.5 Î¼Î7ÏÎ¹ÎÎ½ Tween-80 and 0.5 % methylcellulose suspension in geometric dilution).

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to anti-TAT226 antibodies and immunconjugates thereof. The invention further relates to methods of using anti-TAT226 antibodies and immunconjugates thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies that bind to polypeptides expressed on the surface of cancer cells have proven to be effective anti-cancer therapies. Such antibodies act through various mechanisms including, for example, activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); induction by the antibody of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); enhancement ofcytokine release; and induction of apoptosis. \nSee, e.g,\n \nCardarelli et al. (2002) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 51:15-24\n. For example, HERCEPTINÂ® and RITUXANÂ® (both from Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California) are antibodies that have been used successfully to treat breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. HERCEPTINÂ® is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) proto-oncogene. HER2 protein overexpression is observed in 25-30% of primary breast cancers. RITUXANÂ® is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Both these antibodies are recombinantly produced in CHO cells. HERCEPTINÂ® appears to act, at least in part, by inhibiting angiogenesis (\nIzumi et al. (2002) Nature 416:279-280\n), and-RITUXANÂ® appears to act, at least in part, by inducing apoptosis (\nCardarelli et al. (2002) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 51:15-24\n). EBI Accession No. GSP : AEG35724 discloses a human consensus sequence polypeptide 01034/05915.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates, or \"antibody-drug conjugates,\" are useful for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents in the treatment of cancer. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nSyrigos et al. (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614\n; \nNiculescu-Duvaz et al. (1997) Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 26:151-172\n; \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278\n \n. Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery ofa drug moiety to a tumor, whereas systemic administration of unconjugated cytotoxic agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated. \nSee\n \nBaldwin et al. (Mar. 15, 1986) Lancet pp. 603-05\n; \nThorpe (1985) \"\nAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\n\" in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological and Clinical Applications (A. Pinchera et al., eds.) pp. 475-506\n. Immunoconjugates that target cell surface polypeptides have been and continue to be developed for the treatment of cancer. For review, \nsee, e.g.,\n \nHamann et al. (2005) Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2005) 15:1087-1103\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is clear that there is a continuing need for agents that target cell surface polypeptides for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.

DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Definitions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody \nin situ\n within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is separated from at least one other nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated, for example, in its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid molecule further includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Purified\" means that a molecule is present in a sample at a concentration of at least 95% by weight, or at least 98% by weight of the sample in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"substantially similar\" or \"substantially the same,\" as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"substantially reduced,\" or \"substantially different,\" as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"vector,\" as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a \"plasmids,'.' which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"recombinant expression vectors,\" or simply, \"expression vectors.\" In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \"plasmid\" and \"vector\" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Polynucleotide,\" or \"nucleic acid,\" as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, \"caps,\" substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl-, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, Î±-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (\"thioate\"), P(S)S (\"dithioate\"), (O)NR\n2\n (\"amidate\"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO, or CH2 (\"formacetal\"), in which each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-O-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Oligonucleotide,\" as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single-stranded, generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms \"oligonucleotide\" and \"polynucleotide\" are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California, or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: \n \n \n100\n \n \n \ntimes the fraction X\n \n/\n \nY\n \n \n \n where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"TAT226,\" as used herein, refers to any native TAT226 from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g. humans) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses \"full-length,\" unprocessed TAT226 as well as any form of TAT226 that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of TAT226, e.g., splice variants or allelic variants. A \"mature form\" of TAT226 is a form of TAT226 that has undergone processing, e.g., a form of TAT226 that has undergone N-terminal (e.g., signal sequence) and/or C-terminal cleavage and/or modification by attachment of a GPI anchor. In one embodiment, a \"mature form\" of TAT226 is expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibodies\" (Abs) and \"immunoglobulins\" (Igs) are glycoproteins having similar structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which generally lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"antibody\" and \"immunoglobulin\" are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (\ne.g\n., full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, monovalent antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (\ne.g\n., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity) and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be chimeric, human, humanized and/or affinity matured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"anti-TAT226 antibody\" or \"an antibody that binds to TAT226\" refers to an antibody that is capable of binding TAT226 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting TAT226. Preferably, the extent of binding of an anti-TAT226 antibody to an unrelated, non-TAT226 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to TAT226 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to TAT226 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of â¤ 10 nM, â¤ 1 nM, or â¤ 0.1 nM. In certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody binds to an epitope of TAT226 that is conserved among TAT226 from different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"variable region\" or \"variable domain\" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as \"VH.\" The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as \"VL.\" These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen-binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991\n)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"light chains\" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (Îº) and lambda (Î»), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called Î±, Î´, Îµ, y, and Âµ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, \nAbbas et al. Cellular and Mol. Immunology, 4th ed. (2000\n). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"full length antibody,\" \"intact antibody\" and \"whole antibody\" are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain the Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibody fragments\" comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion retains at least one, and as many as most or all, of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an \nin vivo\n half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring \nin vivo\n stability to the fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')\n2\n fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy-and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a \"dimeric\" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')\n2\n antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see \nPluckthun, in. The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO93/1161\n \n; \nHudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134\n; and \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993\n). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in \nHudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally occurring mutations, that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones, or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity \nin vivo,\n to create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., \nKohler et al., Nature, 256: 495 (1975\n); \nHarlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988\n); \nHammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981\n)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n), phage display technologies (see, e.g., \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n); \nMarks et al., J.

Methods 284(1-2): 119-132(2004\n), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., \n \nWO98/24893\n \n; \n \nWO96/34096\n \n; \n \nWO96/33735\n \n; \n \nWO91/10741\n \n; \nJakobovits et al., Proc.

Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Humanized\" forms of non-human (\ne.g\n., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see \nJones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986\n);\n Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988\n); and \nPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992\n).

Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"human antibody\" is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"hypervariable region,\" \"HVR,\" or \"HV,\" when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six hypervariable regions, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. \nXu et al.

The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (\nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991\n)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (\nChothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987\n)). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The \"contact\" hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.

The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Framework\" or \"FR\" residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat\" or \"amino acid position numbering as in Kabat,\" and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991\n). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (\nresidue\n 52a according to Kabat) after \nresidue\n 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy \nchain FR residue\n 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"affinity matured\" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. \nMarks et al. Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992\n) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is described by: \nBarbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994\n); \nSchier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995\n); \nYelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995\n); \nJackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995\n); and \nHawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"blocking\" antibody or an \"antagonist\" antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"agonist antibody,\" as used herein, is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody \"effector functions\" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (\ne.g.\n B cell receptor); and B cell activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fc receptor\" or \"FcR\" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments, an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments, an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII, and FcÎ³RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. FcÎ³RII receptors include FcÎ³RIIA (an \"activating receptor\") and FcÎ³RIIB (an \"inhibiting receptor\"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcÎ³RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (TTAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcÎ³RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see \nDaÃ«ron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997\n)). FcRs are reviewed in \nRavetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991\n); \nCapel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994\n); and \nde Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41 (1995\n). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \"FcR\" herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Fc receptor\" or \"FcR\" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (\nGuyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976\n) and \nKim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994\n)) and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie 1997, Hinton 2004). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO00/42072 (Presta\n \n) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of that patent publication is specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nShields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Human effector cells\" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments, the cells express at least FcÎ³RIII and perform ADCC effector function(s). Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g., from blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\" or \"ADCC\" refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcÎ³RIII only, whereas monocytes express FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII and FcÎ³RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of \nRavetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991\n). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an \nin vitro\n ADCC assay, such as that described in \n \nUS Patent No. 5,500,362\n \n or \n \n5,821,337\n \n or \n \nPresta U.S. Patent No. 6,737,056\n \n may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed \nin vivo,\n e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in \nClynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Complement dependent cytotoxicity\" or \"CDC\" refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, \ne.g.\n as described in \nGazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996\n), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in \n \nUS Patent No. 6,194,551B1\n \n and \n \nWO99/51642\n \n. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nIdusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Fc region-comprising polypeptide\" refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin, which comprises an Fc region. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly, a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447, with all K447 removed, or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"acceptor human framework\" for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework \"derived from\" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those changes occur at only three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71 A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"human consensus framework\" is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991\n). In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al., \nsupra.\n In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al., \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"VH subgroup III consensus framework\" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., \nsupra.\n In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (SEQ ID NO:50)-H1-WVRQAPGKGLEWV (SEQ ID NO:51)-H2-RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC (SEQ ID NO:59)-H3-WGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:35).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"VL subgroup I consensus framework\" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., \nsupra.\n In one embodiment, the \nVH subgroup\n 1 consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (SEQ ID NO:60)-L1-WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY (SEQ ID NO:61)-L2-GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLT1SSLQPEDFATYYC (SEQ ID NO:62)-L3-FGQGTKVEIK (SEQ ID NO:63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the \"Kd\" or \"Kd value\" according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (\nChen, et al., (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881\n). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 Âµg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23Â°C). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in \nPresta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599\n). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 Âµl/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment, the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore\nâ¢\n-2000 or a BIAcore\nâ¢\n-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25Â°C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips art â¼10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with \nN\n-ethyl-\nN\n'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and \nN-\nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 Âµg/ml (â¼0.2 ÂµM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 Âµl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25Â°C at a flow rate of approximately 25 Âµl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., \nChen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881\n. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6\n M\n-1\n s\n-1\n by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25Â°C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"on-rate,\" \"rate of association,\" \"association rate,\" or \"k\non\n\" according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIAcore\nâ¢\n-2000 or a BIAcore\nâ¢\n-3000 system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"disorder\" is any condition or disease that would benefit from treatment with an substance/molecule or method of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include cancerous conditions such as tumors, e.g., carcinomas (epithelial tumors) and blastomas (embryonic tissue-derived tumors), and in some embodiments, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer (including endometrial cancer), brain tumors (e.g., astrocytomas and gliomas), and kidney cancer, including nephroblastomas (e.g., Wilms' tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"cell proliferative disorder\" and \"proliferative disorder\" refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Tumor;\" as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. The terms \"cancer,\" \"cancerous,\" \"cell proliferative disorder,\" \"proliferative disorder\" and \"tumor\" are not mutually exclusive as referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"cancer\" and \"cancerous\" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth/proliferation. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders, and various types of head and neck cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"treatment\" (and variations such as \"treat\" or \"treating\") refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"individual\" is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments, the vertebrate is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals (such as cows), sport animals, pets (such as cats, dogs, and horses), primates, mice and rats. In certain embodiments, a mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a substance/molecule of the invention may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the substance/molecule, to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount encompasses an amount in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance/molecule are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount would be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cytotoxic agent\" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents a cellular function and/or causes cell death or destruction. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212\n and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., methotrexate, adriamicin, vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide), doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents, enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes, antibiotics, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof, and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below. Other cytotoxic agents are described below. A tumoricidal agent causes destruction of tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"toxin\" is any substance capable of having a detrimental effect on the growth or proliferation of a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"chemotherapeutic agent\" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells (such as a cell expressing TAT226) in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in \nThe Molecular Basis of Cancer, Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., \n. The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel (TAXOTEREÂ®, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOLÂ®, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"intracellular metabolite\" refers to a compound resulting from a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The metabolic process or reaction may be an enzymatic process, such as proteolytic cleavage of a peptide linker of the ADC, or hydrolysis of a functional group such as a hydrazone, ester, or amide. Intracellular metabolites include, but are not limited to, antibodies and free drug which have undergone intracellular cleavage after entry, diffusion, uptake or transport into a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"intracellularly cleaved\" and \"intracellular cleavage\" refer to a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) whereby the covalent attachment, i.e. linker, between the drug moiety (D) and the antibody (Ab) is broken, resulting in the free drug dissociated from the antibody inside the cell. The cleaved moieties of the ADC are thus intracellular metabolites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"bioavailability\" refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cytotoxic activity\" refers to a cell-killing, cytostatic or growth inhibitory effect of an antibody-drug conjugate or an intracellular metabolite of an antibody-drug conjugate.

Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \"racemic mixture\" and \"racemate\" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Leaving group\" refers to a functional group that can be substituted by another functional group. Certain leaving groups are well known in the art, and examples include, but are not limited to, a halide (\ne.g.\n, chloride, bromide, iodide), methanesulfonyl (mesyl), p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl), trifluoromethylsulfonyl (triflate), and trifluoromethylsulfonate.\n\n\n \n\n\nB.

Immunoconjugates comprising anti-TAT226 antibodies as defined in the claims are provided. Antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention are useful, e.g., for the diagnosis or treatment of disorders associated with altered expression, e.g., increased expression, of TAT226.

Anti-TAT226 Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTAT226 (\"Tumor-associated Antigenic Target no. 226\") is a protein that is processed and expressed on the surface of certain cell types, including tumor cells. In particular, human TAT226 has previously been reported to be overexpressed in certain types of tumors, including ovarian, uterine, endometrial, kidney, lung, pancreatic, adrenal, and hepatocellular tumors. \nSee\n, \ne.g.\n, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. \n \nUS 2003/0148408 A1\n \n, \n \nUS 2004/0229277 A1\n \n, and \n \nUS 2003/0100712 A1\n \n (referring to TAT226 as \"PRO9917\"); and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,710,170 B2\n \n (SEQ ID NO:215). Other database entries and disclosures related to TAT226 are as follows: NCBI accession no. AY358628_1 (referring to human TAT226 as \"PSCA Hlog\"); NCBI accession no. AAQ88991.1 and \"gi\" no. 37182378 (referring to human TAT226 as \"PSCA Hlog\"); RIKEN cDNA 2700050C12; \n \nUS 2003/0096961 A1\n \n (SEQ ID NO:16); \n \nUS 2003/0129192 A1\n \n (SEQ ID NO:215); \n \nUS 2003/0206918 A1\n \n (Example 5; SEQ ID NO:215); \n \nUS 2003/0232056 A1\n \n (SEQ ID NO:215); \n \nUS 2004/0044179 A1\n \n (SEQ ID NO:16); \n \nUS 2004/0044180 A1\n \n (SEQ ID NO:16); \n \nUS 2005/0238649 A1\n \n (referring to human TAT226 as \"PSCA Hlog\"); \n \nWO 2003/025148\n \n (SEQ ID NO:292); \n \nWO 2003/105758\n \n (SEQ ID NO:14); and \n \nEP 1347046\n \n (SEQ ID NO:2640).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull-length TAT226 undergoes processing in the cell to generate a mature form of the protein that is expressed on the cell surface. For example, a full length human TAT226 as shown in SEQ ID NO:75 contains a predicted signal peptide sequence from amino acids 1-20 or 1-22, which is predicted to be cleaved from the protein. The C-terminus from amino acids 116-141 is predicted to be cleaved from the protein, and a GPI moiety attached to the protein at amino acid 115. A mature form of human TAT226, from amino acids 21-115 or 23-115 of SEQ ID NO:75, is predicted to be anchored to the cell surface via the GPI moiety. Monkey and rodent TAT226 (\nsee\n, \ne.g.\n, SEQ ID NOs:76-78) are highly similar to human TAT226 and thus are believed to be cleaved and modified at the equivalent amino acid positions. \nSee\n \nFigure 1\n. The resulting mature forms of human, monkey, and rodent TAT226 from amino acid 21-115 or 23-115 (as shown in \nFigure 1\n) are 100% identical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features of human TAT226 include a predicted N-glycosylation site at \namino acid\n 45, which was confirmed empirically, and a predicted Ly6/u-PAR domain from amino acids 94-107 of SEQ ID NO:75. Human TAT226 has about 32% amino acid homology with prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), a prostate cancer-specific tumor antigen that is expressed on the cell surface via a GPI linkage. \nSee\n \nReiter et al. (1998) Proc. Nat 'l. Acad. Sci. USA 95:1735-1740\n. PSCA is overexpressed in over 80% of prostate cancers. \nId.\n Like TAT226, it contains a predicted Ly6/u-PAR domain, which has been implicated in cell functions such as signal transduction and cell adhesion. \nId\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides antibodies as defined in the claims that bind to TAT226.

In some embodiments, an antibody that binds to a mature form of TAT226 expressed on the cell surface inhibits the growth of a cell. In some embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody binds to a mature form of TAT226 expressed on the cell surface and inhibits cell proliferation. In certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody binds to a mature form of TAT226 expressed on the cell surface and induces cell death.

Antibody Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see \nHudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med 9:129-134\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., \nMorimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992\n); and \nBrennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985\n)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (\nCarter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992\n)). According to another approach, F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab')\n2\n fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046\n \n. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments, an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See \n \nWO 93/16185\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894\n \n; and \n \n5,587,458\n \n. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See \nAntibody Engineering\n, ed. Borrebaeck, supra. The antibody fragment may also be a \"linear antibody\", e.g., as described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870\n \n, for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. Humanized Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \"import\" residues, which are typically taken from an \"import\" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (\nJones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522-525\n; \nRiechmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-327\n; \nVerhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239:1534-1536\n), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \"humanized\" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called \"best-fit\" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (\nSims et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:2296\n; \nChothia et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901\n. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (\nCarter et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285\n; \nPresta et al. (1993) J. Immunol., 151:2623\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, \ni.e\n., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n4. Human Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s) as described above. Alternatively, human monoclonal anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by \nKozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n); and \nBoerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g:, \nJakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 90: 2551 (1993\n); \nJakobovits et al., Nature, 362: 255 (1993\n); \nBruggermann et al., Year in Immunol., 7: 33 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human, e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called \"epitope imprinting\", either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see \n \nPCT WO 93/06213 published April 1, 1993\n \n). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n5. Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for TAT226 and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of TAT226. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express TAT226. These antibodies possess a TAT226-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent, such as, e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-Î±, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (\ne.g\n. F(ab')\n2\n bispecific antibodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (\nMilstein and Cuello, Nature, 305: 537 (1983\n)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in \n \nWO 93/08829 published May 13, 1993\n \n, and in \nTraunecker et al., EMBO J., 10: 3655 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion, for example, is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments, the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in \n \nWO 94/04690\n \n. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, \nSuresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another approach, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The interface comprises at least a part of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (\ne.g\n. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \"cavities\" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (\ne.g\n. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \"heteroconjugate\" antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have; for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (\n \nUS Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n), and for treatment of HIV infection (\n \nWO 91/00360\n \n, \n \nWO 92/00373\n \n, and \n \nEP 03089\n \n). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking method. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in \n \nUS Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. \nBrennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985\n) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab')\n2\n fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from \nE\n. \ncoli\n, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. \nShalaby et al., J. Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992\n) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')\n2\n molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from \nE\n. \ncoli\n and subjected to directed chemical coupling \nin vitro\n to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. \nKostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992\n). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \"diabody\" technology described by \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993\n) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See \nGruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For examples, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. \nTutt et al. J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n6. Multivalent Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. In certain embodiments, the dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. In certain embodiments, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of) three to about eight antigen binding sites. In one such embodiment, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of) four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (for example, two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance; the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n -VD2-(X2)n -Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two (for example, four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n7. Single-Domain Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is a single-domain antibody. A single-domain antibody is a single polyeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, MA; \nsee, e.g\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,248,516 BI\n \n). In one embodiment, a single-domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n8. Antibody Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085\n. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (\ne.g\n., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation \nper se\n need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (\ne.g\n. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites) is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition, deletion, or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No \n \nUS 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.\n \n). See also \n \nUS 2004/0093621\n \n (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in \n \nWO 2003/011878, Jean-Mairet et al\n \n. and \n \nUS Patent No. 6,602,684, Umana et al\n \n. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in \n \nWO 1997/30087, Patel et al\n \n. See, also, \n \nWO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.\n \n) and \n \nWO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.\n \n) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also \n \nUS 2005/0123546 (Umana et al\n \n.) on antigen-binding molecules with modified glycosylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a glycosylation variant comprises an Fc region, wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally, the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC, for example, substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (Eu numbering of residues). Examples of publications related to \"defucosylated\" or \"fucose-deficient\" antibodies include: \n \nUS 2003/0157108\n \n; \n \nWO 2000/61739\n \n; \n \nWO 2001/29246\n \n; \n \nUS 2003/0115614\n \n; \n \nUS 2002/0164328\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0093621\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0132140\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0110704\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0110282\n \n; \n \nUS 2004/0109865\n \n; \n \nWO 2003/085119\n \n; \n \nWO 2003/084570\n \n; \n \nWO 2005/035586\n \n; \n \nWO 2005/035778\n \n; \n \nWO2005/053742\n \n; \nOkazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004\n); \nYamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004\n). Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (\nRipka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986\n); US Pat Appl No \n \nUS 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L\n \n; and \n \nWO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al\n \n., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, \nFUT8\n, knockout CHO cells (\nYamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"preferred substitutions.\" If such substitutions result in a desirable change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOriginal Residue\n \n \n \nExemplary Substitutions\n \n \n \nPreferred Substitutions\n \n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nVal; Leu; Ile\n \nVal\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nLys; Gln; Asn\n \nLys\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \nGln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg\n \nGln\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nGlu; Asn\n \nGlu\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nSer; Ala\n \nSer\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nAsn; Glu\n \nAsn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nAsp; Gln\n \nAsp\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nAla\n \nAla\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nAsn; Gln; Lys; Arg\n \nArg\n \n \n \nIle (I)\n \nLeu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine\n \nLeu\n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nNorleucine; Ile; Val; Met; Ala; Phe\n \nIle\n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \nArg; Gln; Asn\n \nArg\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nLeu; Phe; Ile\n \nLeu\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nTrp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr\n \nTyr\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nAla\n \nAla\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nThr\n \nThr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nVal; Ser\n \nSer\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \nTyr; Phe\n \nTyr\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \nTrp; Phe; Thr; Ser\n \nPhe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nIle; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine\n \nLeu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in \nA. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975\n)):\n\n \n \n \n(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)\n \n(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gln (Q)\n \n(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E)\n \n(4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His(H)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n \n(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n \n(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;\n \n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (\ne.g\n. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have modified (e.g., improved) biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (\ne.g\n. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein (e.g., the gene III product of M13) packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (\ne.g\n. binding affinity). In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, scanning mutagenesis (e.g., alanine scanning) can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art, including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art, including those described herein, and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (\ne.g\n., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (\ne.g\n. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example, it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered (\ni.e\n., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in \n \nWO99/51642\n \n. See also \nDuncan & Winter Nature 322:738-40 (1988\n); \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,648,260\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,624,821\n \n; and \n \nWO94/29351\n \n concerning other examples of Fc region variants. \n \nWO00/42072 (Presta\n \n) and \n \nWO 2004/056312 (Lowman\n \n) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nShields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001\n). Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (\nGuyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976\n) and \nKim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994\n)), are described in \n \nUS2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.\n \n). These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in \n \nUS patent No. 6,194,551B1\n \n, \n \nWO99/51642\n \n. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, \nIdusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region, wherein the modifications facilitate and/or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art, e.g., as described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n9. Antibody Derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (\nKam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 102: 11600-11605 (2005\n)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.\n\n\n \n\n\nB. Certain Methods of Making \nAntibodies\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Certain Hybridoma-Based Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-TAT226 monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to TAT226 generally are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of TAT226 and an adjuvant. TAT226 may be prepared using methods well-known in the art, some of which are further described herein. For example, TAT226 may be produced recombinantly. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with a derivative of TAT226 that contains an extracellular portion of TAT226 fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with an TAT226-IgG1 fusion protein. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with immunogenic derivatives of TAT226 in a solution with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)/trehalose dicrynomycolate (TDM) (Ribi Immunochem. Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT), and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. Seven to fourteen days later the animals are bled, and the serum is assayed for anti- TAT226 titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized \nin vitro.\n Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium, e.g., a medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Exemplary myeloma cells include, but are not limited to, murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (\nKozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies that bind to TAT226. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an \nin vitro\n binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of \nMunson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, And/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986\n)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown \nin vivo\n as ascites tumors in an animal. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Certain Library Screening Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are described generally in \nHoogenboom et al. (2001) in Methods in MolecularBiology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ\n), and in certain embodiments, in \nLee et al. (2004) J. Mol. Biol. 340:1073-1093\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-TAT226 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda MD (1991), vols. 1-3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops (HVRs) or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). As used herein, scfv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as \"Fv phage clones\" or \"Fv clones.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993\n). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in \nHoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-TAT226 clones is desired, the subject is immunized with TAT226 to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-TAT226 clones is obtained by generating an anti-TAT226 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that TAT226 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against TAT226. The generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-TAT226 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing TAT226-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation using TAT226 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled TAT226 followed by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which TAT226 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in \nOrlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989\n), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) and in \nWard et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989\n). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in \nJones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991\n), and forward primers within the constant region as described in \nSastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989\n). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi \net al\n. (1989) or Sastry \net al\n. (1989). In certain embodiments, library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n) or as described in the method of\n Orum et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993\n). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nTomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992\n)), and mapped (reported in \nMatsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993\n); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992\n). Human VÎº and VÎ» segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in\n Williams and Winter, Eur. J. Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993\n)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in \nHogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993\n), or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n). The \nin vivo\n recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE\n. \ncoli\n transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12\n clones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n-8\n M).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, \"in cell PCR assembly\" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in \nEmbleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked \nin vitro\n by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter \net al.\n (1994), \nsupra.\n For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in\n Leung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989\n)) in the method of \nHawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992\n) or in the method of \nGram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992\n). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. \n \nWO 9607754 (published 14 March 1996\n \n) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities of about 10\n-9\n M or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScreening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known in the art. For example, TAT226 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized TAT226 under conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or by alkali, e.g. as described in \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or by TAT226 antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n, and a low coating density of antigen as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for TAT226. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting TAT226, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants, phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated TAT226, but with the biotinylated TAT226 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for TAT226. The high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such \"equilibrium capture\" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 clones may be selected based on activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides anti-TAT226 antibodies that bind to living cells that naturally express TAT226. In one embodiment, the invention provides anti-TAT226 antibodies that block the binding between a TAT226 ligand and TAT226, but do not block the binding between a TAT226 ligand and a second protein. Fv clones corresponding to such anti-TAT226 antibodies can be selected by (1) isolating anti-TAT226 clones from a phage library as described above, and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host; (2) selecting TAT226 and a second protein against which blocking and non-blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti-TAT226 phage clones to immobilized TAT226; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize TAT226-binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli\n cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include \nSkerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5: 256 (1993\n) and \nPluckthun, Immunol. Revs, 130: 151 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and/or light chain constant regions (e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat \net al\n., supra) to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and/or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human) species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence(s) for \"hybrid,\" full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the definition of \"chimeric\" and \"hybrid\" antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments, an Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence(s) for full- or partial-length human heavy and/or light chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding anti-TAT226 antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone (e.g. as in the method of \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984\n)). DNA encoding a hybridoma- or Fv clone-derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone-derived antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally, host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.\n\n\n \na) \nGenerating antibodies using prokaryotic host cells:\n \n\n\n\n\n(1) Vector Construction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in \n \nCarter et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,648,237\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example, bacteriophage such as Î»GEM.TM.-11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as E. coli LE392.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs, encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream (5') to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the Î²-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains (\nSiebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269\n) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains (e.g., the E. coli trxB- strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. \nProba and Pluckthun Gene, 159:203 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can also be produced by using an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523\n \n. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron. For a given TIR, a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, changes in the nucleotide sequence are silent. Alterations in the TIR can include, for example, alterations in the number or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a \"codon bank\" at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent). This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in \nYansura et al. (1992) METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. 4:151-158\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in \n \nSimmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5, 840,523\n \n. Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include Escherichia (e.g., E. coli), Bacilli (e.g., B. subtilis), Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas species (e.g., P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla, or Paracoccus. In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used. In one embodiment, E. coli cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of E. coli strains include strain W3110 (\nBachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219\n; ATCC Deposit No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 ÎfhuA (ÎtonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ÎompTÎ(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635\n \n). Other strains and derivatives thereof, such as E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), E. coli B, E. coliÎ» 1776 (ATCC 31,537) and E. coli RV308(ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, \nBass et al., Proteins, 8:309-314 (1990\n). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.\n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Antibody Production\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachroniosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nprokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. In certain embodiments, for E. coli growth, growth temperatures range from about 20Â°C to about 39Â°C; from about 25Â°C to about 37Â°C; or about 30Â°C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. In certain embodiments, for E. coli, the pH is from about 6.8 to about 7.4, or about 7.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly, the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. In certain embodiments, the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P. medium (see, e.g., \nSimmons et al., J. Immunol. Methods (2002), 263:133-147\n). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity, and in certain embodiments, about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (the preferred carbon/energy source). Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells, have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD550 of about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,transisomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. \nChen et al. (1999) J. Biol.

The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41kD cell wall protein from \nStaphylococcus aureas\n which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. \nLindmark et al (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13\n. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized can be a column comprising a glass or silica surface, or a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to possibly prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the first step of purification, a preparation derived from the cell culture as described above can be applied onto a Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase would then be washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.\n\n\n \nb) \nGenerating antibodies using eukaryotic host cells:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell generally includes one or more of the following non-limiting components: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n\n\n(1) Signal sequence component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptides having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected may be one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such a precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Origin of replication\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n \n\n\n(3) Selection gene component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in some embodiments, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. In some embodiments, an appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,965,199\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n(4) Promoter component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., an antibody). Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. For example, virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. In certain embodiments, any or all of these sequences may be suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,419,446\n \n. A modification of this system is described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,601,978\n \n. See also \nReyes et al., Nature 297:598-60 (1982\n), describing expression of human Î²-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n \n\n\n(5) Enhancer element component\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTranscription of DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, Î±-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also \nYaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982\n) describing enhancer elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is generally located at a site 5' from the promoter.\n\n\n \n\n\n(6) Transcription termination components\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See \n \nWO94/11026\n \n and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n\n\n(7) Selection and transformation of host cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, \nGraham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977\n)) ; baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, \nUrlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980\n)) ; mouse sertoli cells (TM4, \nMather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980\n)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (\nMather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982\n)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n\n\n(8) Culturing the host cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in \nHam et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979\n), \nBarnes et al., Anal. Biochem. 102:255 (1980\n), \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704\n \n; \n \n4,657,866\n \n; \n \n4,927,762\n \n; \n \n4,560,655\n \n; or \n \n5,122,469\n \n; \n \nWO 90/03430\n \n; \n \nWO 87/00195\n \n; or \n \nU.S. Patent Re. 30,985\n \n may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCINâ¢ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n\n\n(9) Purification of antibody\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, may be removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems may be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being a convenient technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human Î³1, Î³2, or y4 heavy chains (\nLindmark et al., J. Immunol. Methods 62:1-13 (1983\n)). Protein G is recommenced for all mouse isotypes and for human Î³3 (\nGuss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986\n)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached may be agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABXâ¢resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSEâ¢ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to further purification, for example, by low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research, testing, and clinical use are well-established in the art, consistent with the above-described methodologies and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody of interest.\n\n\n \n\n\nC. Immunoconjugates\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides immunoconjugates (interchangeably referred to as \"antibody-drug conjugates,\" or \"ADCs\") comprising any of the anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents, such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates may be used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents, i.e., drugs that kill or inhibit the growth or proliferation of tumor cells, in the treatment of cancer (\nSyrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614\n; \nNiculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 26:151-172\n; \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278\n \n). Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery of a drug moiety to a tumor, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of unconjugated drugs may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (\nBaldwin et al., Lancet (Mar. 15, 1986) pp. 603-05\n; \nThorpe (1985) \"\nAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\n\" in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications (A. Pinchera et al., eds) pp. 475-506\n. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (\nRowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21:183-87\n). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (\nMandler et al (2000) J. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581\n; \nMandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028\n; \nMandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791\n), maytansinoids (\n \nEP 1391213\n \n; \nLiu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623\n), and calicheamicin (\nLode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928\n; \nHinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342\n). The toxins may exert their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZEVALINÂ® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and 111 In or 90Y radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (\nWiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77\n; \nWiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42\n; \nWitzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63\n; \nWitzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69\n). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARGâ¢ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (\nDrugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686\n; \n \nUS Patent Nos. 4970198\n \n; \n \n5079233\n \n; \n \n5585089\n \n; \n \n5606040\n \n; \n \n5693762\n \n; \n \n5739116\n \n; \n \n5767285\n \n; \n \n5773001\n \n). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas) and cAC10 (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies) (\nDoronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnol. 21(7):778-784\n) and are under therapeutic development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an anti-TAT226 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein (e.g., above). Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof can also be used and are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an anti-TAT226 antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, including, but not limited to, small molecule drugs such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoid, dolastatin, auristatin, trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these drugs that have cytotoxic activity. Examples of such immunoconjugates are discussed in further detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n1. Exemplary Immunoconjugates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn immunoconjugate (or \"antibody-drug conjugate\" (\"ADC\")) of the invention may be of Formula I, below, wherein an anti-TAT226 antibody is conjugated (i.e., covalently attached) to one or more drug moieties (D) through an optional linker (L).\n\n\n\nââââââââAb-(L-D)\np\n I\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the anti-TAT226 antibody may be conjugated to the drug either directly or via a linker. In Formula I, p is the average number of drug moieties per antibody, which can range, e.g., from about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, and in certain embodiments, from 1 to about 8 drug moieties per antibody.\n\n\n \na) \nExemplary Linkers\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA linker may comprise one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (\"MC\"), maleimidopropanoyl (\"MP\"), valine-citrulline (\"val-cit\" or \"vc\"), alanine-phenylalanine (\"ala-phe\"), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (a \"PAB\"), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (\"SPP\"), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (\"SMCC\"), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate (\"SIAB\"). Various linker components are known in the art, some of which are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker may be a \"cleavable linker,\" facilitating release of a drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker (e.g., hydrazone), protease-sensitive (e.g., peptidase-sensitive) linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (\nChari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992\n); \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n) may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise a \"stretcher unit\" that links an antibody to another linker component or to a drug moiety. Exemplary stretcher units are shown below (wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to an antibody):\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise an amino acid unit. In one such embodiment, the amino acid unit allows for cleavage of the linker by a protease, thereby facilitating release of the drug from the immunoconjugate upon exposure to intracellular proteases, such as lysosomal enzymes. \nSee, e.g.\n, \nDoronina et al. (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21:778-784\n. Exemplary amino acid units include, but are not limited to, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide, and a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe); phenylalanine-lysine (fk or phe-lys); or N-methyl-valine-citrulline (Me-val-cit). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). An amino acid unit may comprise amino acid residues that occur naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid units can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzyme, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise a \"spacer\" unit that links the antibody to a drug moiety, either directly or by way of a stretcher unit and/or an amino acid unit. A spacer unit may be \"self-iinmolative\" or a \"non-self-immolative.\" A \"non-self-immolative\" spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer unit remains bound to the drug moiety upon enzymatic (e.g., proteolytic) cleavage of the ADC. Examples of non-self immolative spacer units include, but are not limited to, a glycine spacer unit and a glycine-glycine spacer unit. Other combinations of peptidic spacers susceptible to sequence-specific enzymatic cleavage are also contemplated. For example, enzymatic cleavage of an ADC containing a glycine-glycine spacer unit by a tumor-cell associated protease would result in release of a glycine-glycine-drug moiety from the remainder of the ADC. In one such embodiment, the glycine-glycine-drug moiety is then subjected to a separate hydrolysis step in the tumor cell, thus cleaving the glycine-glycine spacer unit from the drug moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"self immolative\" spacer unit allows for release of the drug moiety without a separate hydrolysis step. In certain embodiments, a spacer unit of a linker comprises a p-aminobenzyl unit. ln one such embodiment, a p-aminobenzyl alcohol is attached to an amino acid unit via an amide bond, and a carbamate, methylcarbamate, or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and a cytotoxic agent. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nHamann et al. (2005) Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2005) 15:1087-1103\n. In one embodiment, the spacer unit is p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PAB). In certain embodiments, the phenylene portion of a p-amino benzyl unit is substituted with Qm, wherein Q is -C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl, - O-(C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl), -halogen,- nitro or -cyano; and m is an integer ranging from 0-4. Examples of self-immolative spacer units further include, but are not limited to, aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to p-aminobenzyl alcohol (\nsee\n, \ne.g.\n, \n \nUS 2005/0256030 Al\n \n), such as 2-aminoimidazol-5-methanol derivatives (\nHay et al. (1999) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9:2237\n) and ortho- or para-aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis, such as substituted and unsubstituted 4-aminobutyric acid amides (\nRodrigues et al., Chemistry Biology, 1995, 2, 223\n); appropriately substituted bicyclo[2.2.1] and bicyclo[2.2.2] ring systems (\nStorm, et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1972, 94, 5815\n); and 2-aminophenylpropionic acid amides (\nAmsberry, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55; 5867\n). Elimination of amine-containing drugs that are substituted at the Î±-position of glycine (\nKingsbury, et al., J. Med.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 3896111\n \n). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,151,042\n \n). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,137,230\n \n; \n \n4,248,870\n \n; \n \n4,256,746\n \n; \n \n4,260,608\n \n; \n \n4,265,814\n \n; \n \n4,294,757\n \n; \n \n4,307,016\n \n; \n \n4,308,268\n \n; \n \n4,308,269\n \n; \n \n4,309,428\n \n; \n \n4,313,946\n \n; \n \n4,315,929\n \n; \n \n4,317,821\n \n; \n \n4,322,348\n \n; \n \n4,331,598\n \n; \n \n4,361,650\n \n; \n \n4,364,866\n \n; \n \n4,424,219\n \n; \n \n4,450,254\n \n; \n \n4,362,663\n \n; and \n \n4,371,533\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody-drug conjugates because they are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification or derivatization of fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art and can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods or produced using genetic engineering techniques (see \nYu et al (2002) PNAS 99:7968-7973\n). Maytansinol and maytansinol analogues may also be prepared synthetically according to known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary maytansinoid drug moieties include those having a modified aromatic ring, such as: C-19-dechloro (\n \nUS Pat.

HERCEPTINÂ® (trastuzumab) linked by SMCC to DM1 has been reported (\n \nWO 2005/037992\n \n; \n \nUS 2005/0276812 A\n \n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther exemplary maytansinoid antibody-drug conjugates have the following structures and abbreviations, (wherein Ab is antibody and p is 1 to about 8):\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary antibody-drug conjugates where DM1 is linked through a BMPEO linker to a thiol group of the antibody have the structure and abbreviation:\n\n \n \n\nwhere Ab is antibody; n is 0, 1, or 2; and p is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates containing maytansinoids, methods of making the same, and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,208,020\n \n,\n \n 5,416,064\n \n, \n \nUS 2005/0276812 A1\n \n, and \nEuropean Patent \n \nEP\n \n \n \n \n 0 425 235 B1\n \n, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. \nLiu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 93:8618-8623 (1996\n) describe immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. \nChari et al. Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992\n) describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER-2/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3 x 10\n5\n HER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n (the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference). An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,208,020\n \n and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5208020\n \n or \n \n \nEP Patent\n 0 425 235 B1\n \n; \nChari et al. Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992\n); and \n \nUS 2005/016993 A1\n \n, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in \n \nUS 2005/0276812 A1\n \n, \"Antibody-drug conjugates and Methods.\" The linkers comprise disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents. Additional linkers are described and exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). In certain embodiments, the coupling agent is N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (\nCarlsson et al., Biochem. J. 173:723-737 (1978\n)) or N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In one embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.\n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Auristatins and dolastatins\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatin or a dolastatin peptidic analog or derivative, e.g., an auristatin (\n \nUS Pat. Nos. 5635483\n \n; \n \n5780588\n \n). Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (\nWoyke et al (2001) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584\n) and have anticancer (\n \nUS Pat. No.5663149\n \n) and antifungal activity (\nPettit et al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-2965\n). The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety (\n \nWO 02/088172\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary auristatin embodiments include the N-terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF, disclosed in \nSenter et al, Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research, \n, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptidic drug moiety may be selected from Formulas D\nE\n and D\nF\n below:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nwherein the wavy line of D\nE\n and D\nF\n indicates the covalent attachment site to an antibody or antibody-linker component, and independently at each location:\n\n \n \n \nR\n2\n is selected from H and C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \nR\n3\n is selected from H, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle, aryl, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-aryl, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle), C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle and C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle);\n \nR\n4\n is selected from H, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle, aryl, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-aryl, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle), C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle and C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle);\n \nR\n5\n is selected from H and methyl;\n \nor R\n4\n and R\n5\n jointly form a carbocyclic ring and have the formula -(CR\na\nR\nb\n)\nn\n- wherein R\na\n and R\nb\n are independently selected from H, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl and C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle and n is selected from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6;\n \nR\n6\n is selected from H and C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \nR\n7\n is selected from H, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle, aryl, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-aryl, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle), C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle and C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle);\n \neach R\n8\n is independently selected from H, OH, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n8\n carbocycle and O-(C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl);\n \nR\n9\n is selected from H and C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \nR\n10\n is selected from aryl or C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle;\n \nZ is O, S, NH, or NR\n12\n, wherein R\n12\n is C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \nR\n11\n is selected from H, C\n1\n-C\n20\n alkyl, aryl, C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle, -(R\n13\nO)\nm\n-R\n14\n, or -(R\n13\nO)\nm\n-CH(R\n15\n)\n2\n;\n \nm is an integer ranging from 1-1000;\n \nR\n13\n is C\n2\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \nR\n14\n is H or C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \neach occurrence of R\n15\n is independently H, COOH, -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-N(R\n16\n)\n2\n, -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-SO\n3\nH, or -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-SO\n3\n-C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl;\n \neach occurrence of R\n16\n is independently H, C\n1\n-C\n8\n alkyl, or -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-COOH;\n \nR\n18\n is selected from -C(R\n8\n)\n2\n-C(R\n8\n)\n2\n-aryl, -C(R\n8\n)\n2\n-C(R\n8\n)\n2\n-(C\n3\n-C\n8\n heterocycle), and -C(R\ng\n)\n2\n-C(R\ng\n)\n2\n-(C\n3\n-Cg carbocycle); and\n \nn is an integer ranging from 0 to 6.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n7\n are independently isopropyl or sec-butyl and R\n5\n is -H or methyl.

The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations.

Another anti-tumor drug to which the antibody can be conjugated is QFA, which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody-mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.\n\n\n \nc) \nOther cytotoxic agents\n \n\n\n \n \n \nOther antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozocin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively as the LL-E33288 complex, d*scribed in \n \nUS Pat.

No. 5,877,296\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, inodeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, \n \nWO 93/21232 published October 28, 1993\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212\n and radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the immunoconjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc\n99m\n or I\n123\n, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the immunoconjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tc\n99m\n or I\n123\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n and In\n111\n can be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (\nFraker et al (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57\n can be used to incorporate iodine-123. \"\nMonoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy\" (Chatal, CRC Press 1989\n) describes other methods in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate may comprise an anti-TAT226 antibody of the invention conjugated to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see \n \nWO 81/01145\n \n) to an active drug, such as an anti-cancer drug. Such immunoconjugates are useful in antibody-dependent enzyme-mediated prodrug therapy (\"ADEPT\"). Enzymes that may be conjugated to an anti-TAT226 antibody of the invention include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatases, which are useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatases, which are useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase, which is useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), which are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, which are useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as Î²-galactosidase and neuraminidase, which are useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; Î²-lactamase, which is useful for converting drugs derivatized with Î²-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase and penicillin G amidase, which are useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Enzymes may be be covalently bound to the anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., \nNeuberger et al., Nature 312:604-608 (1984\n).\n\n\n \nd) \nDrug Loading\n \n\n\n \n \n \nDrug loading is represented by p, the average number of drug moieties per antibody in a molecule of Formula I. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drug moieties (D) per antibody. ADCs of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drug moieties, from 1 to 20. The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in the exemplary embodiments above, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In certain embodiments, higher drug loading, e.g. p >5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. In certain embodiments, the drug loading for an ADC of the invention ranges from 1 to about 8; from about 2 to about 6; or from about 3 to about 5. Indeed, it has been shown that for certain ADCs, the optimal ratio of drug moieties per antibody may be less than 8, and may be about 2 to about 5. \nSee\n \n \nUS 2005-0238649 A1\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent, as discussed below. Generally, antibodies do not contain many free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety; indeed most cysteine thiol residues in antibodies exist as disulfide bridges. In certain embodiments, an antibody may be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), under partial or total reducing conditions, to generate reactive cysteine thiol groups. In certain embodiments, an antibody is subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in different ways, e.g., by: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay, which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC, e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography (\nsee\n, \ne.g.,\n \nHamblett, K.J., et al. \"\nEffect of drug loading on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate,\n\" Abstract No. 624, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004 Annual Meeting, March 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, \n; \nAlley, S.C., et al. \"\nControlling the location of drug attachment in antibody-drug conjugates,\n\" Abstract No. 627, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004 Annual Meeting, March 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, \n). In certain embodiments, a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.\n\n\n \ne) \nCertain Methods of Preparing Immunconjugates\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAn ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab-L via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Exemplary methods for preparing an ADC of Formula I via the latter route are described in \n \nUS 2005-0238649 A1\n \n, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOSt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), such that the antibody is fully or partially reduced. Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through modification of lysine residues, e.g., by reacting lysine residues with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent), resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into an antibody by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., by preparing variant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by reaction between an electrophilic group on an antibody, such as an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group, with a nucleophilic group on a linker reagent or drug. Useful nucleophilic groups on a linker reagent include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. In one embodiment, an antibody is modified to introduce electrophilic moieties that are capable of reacting with nucleophilic subsituents on the linker reagent or drug. In another embodiment, the sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the antibody that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, antibodies containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (\nGeoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146\n; \n \nUS 5362852\n \n). Such an aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with the following cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL., U.S.A; see pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may also be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in \nVitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987\n). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See \n \nWO94/11026\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a fusion protein comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. A recombinant DNA molecule may comprise regions encoding the antibody and cytotoxic portions of the conjugate either adjacent to one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, an antibody may be conjugated to a \"receptor\" (such as streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a \"ligand\" (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).\n\n\n \n\n\nD. Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one anti-TAT226 antibody of the invention and/or at least one immunoconjugate thereof. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1) an anti-TAT226 antibody and/or an immunoconjugate thereof, and 2) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1) an anti-TAT226 antibody and/or an immunoconjugate thereof, and optionally, 2) at least one additional therapeutic agent. Additional therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, those described below in Section E.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations comprising an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or immunoconjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers \n(\n \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980\n)) in the form of aqueous solutions or lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride); phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (\ne.g\n., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEENâ¢, PLURONICSâ¢ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Pharmaceutical formulations to be used for \nin vivo\n administration are generally sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and Î³ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOTâ¢ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies or immunoconjugates remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37Â°C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thiodisulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \n\n\nE. Methods of Using Anti-TAT226 Antibodies and \nImmunoconjugates\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Diagnostic methods and methods of detection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention are useful for detecting the presence of TAT226 in a biological sample. The term \"detecting\" as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. A biological sample may comprise a cell or tissue, such as the tissues listed in \nFigure 13\n. Such tissues may include normal and/or cancerous tissues that express TAT226 at higher levels relative to other tissues, for example, ovarian, kidney, brain, endometrial, adrenal, bone, lung, skin, and soft tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary cell proliferative disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include cancerous conditions such as tumors, e.g., carcinomas (epithelial tumors) and blastomas (embryonic tissue-derived tumors), and in certain embodiments, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, (including endometrial cancer), and kidney cancer, including nephroblastomas (e.g., Wilms' tumor). Ovarian cancer, in particular, encompasses a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors derived from the ovary. Approximately 90% of malignant ovarian tumors are epithelial in origin; the remainder are germ cell and stromal tumors. Epithelial ovarian tumors are classified into the following histological subtypes: serous adenocarcinomas (constituting about 50% of epithelial ovarian tumors); endometrioid adenocarcinomas (â¼20%); mucinous adenocarcinomas (â¼10%); clear cell carcinomas (â¼5-10%); Brenner (transitional cell) tumors (relatively uncommon). The prognosis for ovarian cancer, which is the sixth most common cancer in women, is usually poor, with five year survival rates ranging from 5-30%. For reviews of ovarian cancer, see \nFox et al. (2002) \"\nPathology of epithelial ovarian cancer,\n\" in Ovarian Cancer ch. 9 (Jacobs et al., eds., Oxford University Press, New York\n); \nMorin et al. (2001) \"\nOvarian Cancer,\n\" in Encyclopedia Reference of Cancer, pp.654-656 (Schwab, ed., Springer-Verlag, New York\n). The present invention contemplates methods of diagnosing or treating any of the epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes described above, and in particular, the serous adenocarcinoma subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a method of diagnosis or detection, such as those described above, comprises detecting binding of an anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226 expressed on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing TAT226 on its surface. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell with an anti-TAT226 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-TAT226 antibody and TAT226 on the cell surface. An exemplary assay for detecting binding of an anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226 expressed TAT226 on the surface of a cell is a \"FACS\" assay, such as that described in Example D, below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain other methods can be used to detect binding of anti-TAT226 antibodies to TAT226. Such methods include, but are not limited to, antigen-binding assays that are well known in the art, such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \"sandwich\" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, anti-TAT226 antibodies are labeled. Labels include, but are not limited to, labels or moieties that are detected directly (such as fluorescent, chromophoric, electrondense, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels), as well as moieties, such as enzymes or ligands, that are detected indirectly, e.g., through an enzymatic reaction or molecular interaction. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456\n \n), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, Î²-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, anti-TAT226 antibodies are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Immobilization entails separating the anti-TAT226 antibody from any TAT226 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-TAT226 antibody before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (\n \nBennich et al.., U.S. 3,720,760\n \n), or by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-TAT226 antibody after formation of a complex between the anti-TAT226 antibody and TAT226, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the above embodiments of diagnosis or detection may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti-TAT226 antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Therapeutic methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be used in, for example, \nin vitro, ex vivo,\n and \nin vivo\n therapeutic methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inhibiting cell growth or proliferation\" means decreasing a cell's growth or proliferation by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100%, and includes inducing cell death. In certain embodiments, the cell is a tumor cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is an ovarian tumor cell, a uterine tumor cell, a brain tumor cell, or a kidney tumor cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is a xenograft, e.g., as exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be for use in the treatment or prevention of a cell proliferative disorder. In certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression and/or activity of TAT226. For example, in certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression of TAT226 on the surface of a cell. In certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is a tumor or a cancer. Examples of cell proliferative disorders to be treated by the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention include, but are not limited to, cancerous conditions such as tumors, e.g., carcinomas (epithelial tumors) and blastomas (embryonic tissue-derived tumors), and in certain embodiments, ovarian cancer; uterine cancer, including endometrial cancer; brain tumors (e.g., astrocytomas, encompassing advanced 103 stage gliomas, also referred to as glioblastoma multiforme); and kidney cancer, including nephroblastomas (e.g., Wilms' tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisclosed herein are methods for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an anti-TAT226 antibody and, optionally, at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as those provided below. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising 1) an immunoconjugate comprising an anti-TAT226 antibody and a cytotoxic agent; and optionally, 2) at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as those provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, at least some of the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can bind TAT226 from species other than human. Accordingly, antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used to bind TAT226, e.g., in a cell culture containing TAT226, in humans, or in other mammals having a TAT226 with which an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention cross-reacts (e.g. chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used for inhibiting a TAT226 activity by contacting the antibody or immunoconjugate with TAT226 such that TAT226 activity is inhibited. In one embodiment, the TAT226 is human TAT226.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used in a method for binding TAT226 in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased TAT226 expression and/or activity, the method comprising administering to the individual the antibody or immunoconjugate such that TAT226 in the individual is bound. In one embodiment, the TAT226 is human TAT226, and the individual is a human individual. Alternatively, the individual can be a mammal expressing TAT226 to which an anti-TAT226 antibody binds. Still further the individual can be a mammal into which TAT226 has been introduced (e.g., by administration of TAT226 or by expression of a transgene encoding TAT226).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a human for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing TAT226 with which the antibody cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig, rat, or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance, an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be co-administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, such as a platinum compound (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin); a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel or docetaxel); topotecan; an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin (ADRIAMYCINÂ®) or liposomal doxorubicin (DOXILÂ®)); gemcitabine; cyclophosphamide; vinorelbine (NAVELBINEÂ®); hexamethylmelamine; ifosfamide; and etoposide. In another of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents used in the treatment of uterine or endometrial cancer, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, fluorouracil and medroxyprogesterone. In another of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or combination of agents used in the treatment of brain tumors, such as a nitrosourea (e.g., carmustine or lomustine); a cytotoxic agent (e.g., irinotecan or temozolamide); an antiangiogenic agent (e.g., thalidomide, TNP-470, \nplatelet factor\n 4, interferon and endostatin); a differentiating agent (e.g., retinoids, phenylbutyrate, phenylacetate, and anti-neoplastons); an antiinvasion agent (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors such as marimastat); a signal transduction modulator (e.g., tamoxifen, bryostatin, and O-6 benzyguanine); a topoisomerase inhibitor (e.g., irinotecan or topotecan); and a growth factor inhibitor (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor). In another of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents used in the treatment of kidney cancer (e.g., Wilms' tumor), such as vincristine, actinomycin D, adriamycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention may be combined with an anti-inflammatory and/or antiseptic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration (where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. Antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent or adjuvant) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the binding target is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or immunoconjugate to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Several art-known approaches exist for transporting molecules across the blood-brain barrier, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, stem cell-based methods, and receptor and channel-based methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysical methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood-brain barrier entirely, or by creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. Circumvention methods include, but are not limited to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., \nPapanastassiou et al., Gene Therapy 9: 398-406 (2002\n)), interstitial infusion/convection-enhanced delivery (see, e.g., \nBobo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 2076-2080 (1994\n)), and implanting a delivery device in the brain (see, e.g., \nGill et al., Nature Med. 9: 589-595 (2003\n); and Gliadel Wafersâ¢, Guildford Pharmaceutical). Methods of creating openings in the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0038086\n \n), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (\nNeuwelt, E. A., Implication of the Blood-Brain Barrier and its Manipulation, \n)), permeabilization by, e.g., bradykinin or permeabilizer A-7 (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,112,596\n \n, \n \n5,268,164\n \n, \n \n5,506,206\n \n, and \n \n5,686,416\n \n), and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood-brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0083299\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid-based methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, encapsulating the antibody or immunoconjugate in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313\n \n), and coating the antibody or immunoconjugate in low-density lipoprotein particles (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354\n \n) or apolipoprotein E (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStem-cell based methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier entail genetically engineering neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to express the antibody or immunoconjugate of interest and then implanting the stem cells into the brain of the individual to be treated. \nSee\n \nBehrstock et al. (2005) Gene Ther. 15 Dec. 2005\n advanced online publication (reporting that NPCs genetically engineered to express the neurotrophic factor GDNF reduced symptoms of Parkinson disease when implanted into the brains of rodent and primate models).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor and channel-based methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002/0065259\n \n, \n \n2003/0162695\n \n, and \n \n2005/0124533\n \n); activating potassium channels (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0089473\n \n), inhibiting ABC drug transporters (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0073713\n \n); coating antibodies or immunoconjugates with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0129186\n \n), and cationizing the antibodies or immunoconjugates (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,004,697\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody or immunoconjugate need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody or immunoconjugate present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody or immunoconjugate, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody or immunoconjugate is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody or immunoconjugate, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 Âµg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-10mg/kg) of antibody or immunoconjugate can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 Âµg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody or immunoconjugate would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, \ne.g\n. every week or every three weeks (\ne.g\n. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or \ne.g\n. about six doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. Assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention may be characterized for their physical/chemical properties and/or biological activities by various assays known in the art.\n\n\n \na) \nActivity assays\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, assays are provided for identifying anti-TAT226 antibodies or immunoconjugates thereof haying biological activity. Biological activity may include, e.g., the ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation (e.g., \"cell killing\" activity), or the ability to induce cell death, including programmed cell death (apoptosis). Antibodies or immunoconjugates having such biological activity in vivo and/or in vitro are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vitro. Assays for inhibition of cell growth or proliferation are well known in the art. Certain assays for cell proliferation, exemplified by the \"cell killing\" assays described herein, measure cell viability. One such assay is the CellTiter-Gloâ¢ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, which is commercially available from Promega (Madison, WI). That assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present, which is an indication of metabolically active cells. \nSee\n \nCrouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88\n, \n \nUS Pat. No. 6602677\n \n. The assay may be conducted in 96- or 384-well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS). \nSee\n \nCree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404\n. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\nÂ®\n Reagent) directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units (RLU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother assay for cell proliferation is the \"MTT\" assay, a colorimetric assay that measures the oxidation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan by mitochondrial reductase. Like the CellTiter-Glo\nâ¢\n assay, this assay indicates the number of metabolically active cells present in a cell culture. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nMosmann (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 65:55-63\n, and \nZhang et al. (2005) Cancer Res. 65:3877-3882\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody is tested for its ability to induce cell death in vitro. Assays for induction of cell death are well known in the art. In some embodiments, such assays measure, e.g., loss of membrane integrity as indicated by uptake ofpropidium iodide (PI), trypan blue \n(see\n \nMoore et al. (1995) Cytotechnology, 17:1-11\n), or 7AAD. In an exemplary PI uptake assay, cells are cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM):Ham's F-12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Thus, the assay is performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. Cells are seeded at a density of 3 x 10\n6\n per dish in 100 x 20 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing various concentrations of the antibody or immunoconjugate. The cells are incubated for a 3-day time period. Following treatment, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 Â°C, the pellet resuspended in 3 ml cold Ca\n2+\n binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n) and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer-capped 12 x 75 mm tubes (1 ml per tube, 3 tubes per treatment group) for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI (10 Âµg/ml). Samples are analyzed using a FACSCANâ¢ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERTâ¢ CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Antibodies or immunoconjugates which induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake are thus identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate is tested for its ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in vitro. An exemplary assay for antibodies or immunconjugates that induce apoptosis is an annexin binding assay. In an exemplary annexin binding assay, cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 0.001 to 10 Âµg/ml of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Following a three-day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca\n2+\n binding buffer, and aliquoted into tubes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FITC) (1 Âµg/ml). Samples are analyzed using a FACSCANâ¢ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERTâ¢ CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Antibodies or immunoconjugates that induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are thus identified. Another exemplary assay for antibodies or immunconjugates that induce apoptosis is a histone DNA ELISA colorimetric assay for detecting internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA. Such an assay can be performed using, e.g., the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche, Palo Alto, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells for use in any of the above in vitro assays include cells or cell lines that naturally express TAT226 or that have been engineered to express TAT226. Such cells include tumor cells that overexpress TAT226 relative to normal cells of the same tissue origin. Such cells also include cell lines (including tumor cell lines) that express TAT226 and cell lines that do not normally express TAT226 but have been transfected with nucleic acid encoding TAT226. Exemplary cell lines provided herein for use in any of the above in vitro assays include the OVCAR3 human ovarian cancer cell line, which expresses TAT226, and the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line transfected with nucleic acid encoding TAT226.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vivo. In certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. In vivo model systems, such as xenograft models, can be used for such testing. In an exemplary xenograft system, human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non-human animal, e.g., an athymic \"nude\" mouse. An antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is administered to the animal. The ability of the antibody or immunoconjugate to inhibit or decrease tumor growth is measured. In certain embodiments of the above xenograft system, the human tumor cells are tumor cells from a human patient. Such xenograft models are commercially available from Oncotest GmbH (Frieberg, Germany). In certain embodiments, the human tumor cells are cells from a human tumor cell line, such as OVCAR3 cells, as exemplified herein. In certain embodiments, the human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non-human animal by subcutaneous injection or by transplantation into a suitable site, such as a mammary fat pad.\n\n\n \nb) \nBinding assays and other assays\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody is tested for its antigen binding activity. For example, in certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody is tested for its ability to bind to TAT226 expressed on the surface of a cell. A FACS assay such as that described in Example D may be used for such testing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, competition assays may be used to identify a monoclonal antibody that competes with YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9 YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6 for binding to TAT226. In certain embodiments, such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope (e.g., a linear or a conformational epitope) that is bound by YWO.32, YWO.49 YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9 YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6. Exemplary competition assays include, but are not limited to, routine assays such as those provided in \nHarlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ch.14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY\n). Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in \nMorris (1996) \"\nEpitope Mapping Protocols,\n\" in Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 66 (Humana Press, Totowa, NJ\n). Two antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary competition assay, immobilized TAT226 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to TAT226 (e.g., YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6) and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to TAT226. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized TAT226 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to TAT226, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized TAT226 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized TAT226 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to TAT226. In certain embodiments, immobilized TAT226 is present on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing TAT226 on its surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, purified anti-TAT226 antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, non-denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody \nin vivo\n is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. \nIn vitro\n and/or \nin vivo\n cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcÎ³R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc(RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc(RI, Fc(RII and Fc(RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of \nRavetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immuno/. 9:457-92 (1991\n). An example of an \nin vitro\n assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,500,362\n \n or \n \n5,821,337\n \n. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed \nin vivo, e.g.,\n in a animal model such as that disclosed in \nClynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998\n). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in \nGazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996\n), may be performed. FcRn binding and \nin vivo\n clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\nF. Articles of Manufacture\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDisclosed herein is an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is by itself or combined with another composition effective for treating, preventing and/or diagnosing the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. Moreover, the article of manufacture may comprise (a) a first container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention; and (b) a second container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises a further cytotoxic or otherwise therapeutic agent.

It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.\n\n\n \n\n\nIV. EXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following are examples of methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above. Certain examples are provided for comparative purposes only.\n\n\n \nA. Analysis of TAT226 Gene Expression\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman TAT226 gene expression was analyzed using a proprietary database containing gene expression information (GeneExpressÂ®, Gene Logic Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Graphical analysis of the GeneExpressÂ® database was conducted using a microarray profile viewer. \nFigure 13\n is a graphic representation of TAT226 gene expression in various tissues, which are listed at left. The scale across the top of the graph indicates gene expression levels based on hybridization signal intensity. Dots appear both above and below the line adjacent to each listed tissue. The dots appearing above the line represent gene expression in normal tissue, and the dots appearing below the line represent gene expression in tumor or diseased tissue. \nFigure 13\n shows a trend toward increased TAT226 gene expression in tumor or diseased tissues relative to their normal counterparts. In particular, TAT226 shows substantial overexpression in tumorous and diseased ovary relative to normal ovary and in Wilms' tumor relative to normal kidney. Other tissues showing overexpression in tumor or diseased tissue relative to normal tissue include endometrial, adrenal, bone, lung, skin, and soft tissue. In addition, TAT226 is strongly expressed in normal brain tissue (such as rhinencephalon, hippocampus, and basal ganglia) and in tumorous or diseased brain tissue, such as gliomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GeneExpressÂ® database was also used to analyze human TAT226 gene expression in normal ovary; normal fallopian tube; ovarian cancer of the clear cell, mucinous, and serous cystoadenocarcinoma subtypes; metastatic ovarian cancer; and other types of ovarian cancer. The results are reported graphically in \nFigure 14\n, with the particular tissue types indicated underneath the graph. The scale on the Î³-axis of the graph indicates gene expression levels based on hybridization signal intensity. Serous cystoadenocarcinoma and metastatic ovarian cancer showed strong overexpression of TAT226 relative to normal ovary. Clear cell and mucinous subtypes showed expression comparable to normalÂ·ovary. Normal fallopian tube also showed substantial expression of TAT226. Notably, the serous subtype of ovarian cancer closely resembles fallopian tube-epitbelium histologically, and both ovary and fallopian tubes are derived from the same embryonic tissue. \nSee\n \nFox et al. (2002) \"\nPathology of epithelial ovarian cancer,\n\" in Ovarian Cancer ch. 9 (Jacobs et al., eds., Oxford University Press, New York\n)\n\n\n \n\n\nB. Generation of Anti-TAT226 Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies to TAT226 were generated by screening a phage display library with a recombinant \"TAT226-His\" fusion protein comprising amino acids 1-115 of SEQ ID NO:75 and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. The phage display library was a synthetic (Fab')\n2\n library generated using a Fab'-zip-phage system. \nSee\n \n Lee et al. (2004) J. Immunol. Methods 284:119-132\n. The library comprised a library of heavy chain HVRs in the framework of the huMAb4D5-8 heavy chain variable region \n(see\n \nFigures 5A\n and \n5B\n, second acceptor \"B,\" SEQ ID NOs:50, 51, 57, 35) and a fixed huMAb4D5-8 light chain variable region as shown in SEQ ID NO:26. Clones selected using phage display were screened against TAT226-His using phage ELISA \n(see, e.g.,\n \nSidhu et al. (2004) J. Mol. Biol. 338:299-310\n). Clones YWO.32 and YWO.49 were selected for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo improve the affinity of YWO.49, phage display libraries were generated in the background of YWO.49, with HVR-H3 and HVR-L3 targeted for soft-randomization, in which selected amino acid residues in the designated HVRs were held constant while others were subjected to mutagenesis. Selected clones were screened by phage ELISA. Affinity matured antibodies designated YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 were selected for further analysis. The nucleotide and encoded polypeptide sequences of the VH and VL regions of YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 were determined, as shown in \nFigures 9\n and \n10\n. The heavy and light chain HVR sequences of YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 are shown in \nFigures 2-4\n. Consensus HVR-H3 and HVR-L3 sequences derived from YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 are also shown in \nFigure 4\n. YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 were \"reformatted\" as full-length IgGs by grafting Fab' fragments onto appropriate constant regions using recombinant techniques. The experiments described hereinafter were performed using the reformatted antibodies.\n\n\n \n\n\nC. Characterization of Binding Affinity to Recombinant Antigen\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 for recombinant antigen was determined by surface plasmon resonance measurement using a \nBIACOREÂ®\n 3000 system (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CMS, Biacore Inc.) were activated with \nN\n-ethyl-\nN\n'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Anti-TAT226 antibody was diluted to 5ug/ml with 10mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, before injection at a flow rate of 5Âµl/minute to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU) of coupled antibody. Next, 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of TAT226-His (0.7nM to 500nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 at 25Â°C at a flow rate of 25Âµl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAevaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 2 below.\n\n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \nClone\n \n \n \nk\non\n/10\n5\n \n \n \n \nK\noff\n/10\n-4\n \n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \nYWO.49\n \n0.074\n \n3.49\n \n47.16\n \n \n \nYWO.49.B7\n \n0.27\n \n<0.05\n \n<0.18\n \n \n \nYWO.49.C9\n \n1.53\n \n<0.05\n \n<0.03\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2\n \n0.22\n \n0.05\n \n0.23\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H6\n \n1.86\n \n0.09\n \n0.05\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nD. Characterization of Antibody Binding to Cell Surface TAT226\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-TAT226 antibodies to bind to TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3, a human ovarian cancer cell line, was examined. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on OVCAR3 cells in the absence and in the presence of YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6. Briefly, detached cells were incubated with 5Âµg/ml primary antibody for 1 hour on ice, washed, and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-human IgG conjugated to phycoerythrin) for 30 minutes on ice. FACS was performed using a FACScanâ¢ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of FACS analysis for YWO.49, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.H6 are shown in \nFigure 15\n. The peaks on the left side of each graph represent \"background\" binding, i.e., binding of secondary antibody only. The peaks on the right side of each graph represent binding of the indicated anti-TAT226 antibody. YWO.49.B7 did not bind significantly to OVCAR3 cells by FACS, even though it bound to recombinant antigen with a Kd within the range of Kds observed for YWO.49 and the other affinity matured antibodies (see results of BIACOREO analysis, table 2 above). Binding of YWO.49.C9 was comparable to that observed for YWO.49.H2 and YWO.H6.\n\n\n \n\n\nE. Characterization of Binding Affinity to Cell Surface Antigen\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 for TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3 cells was examined using a competition assay. Briefly, labeled (iodinated) YWO.49.H2 or YWO.49.H6 was allowed to bind to OVCAR3 cells in the presence of unlabeled antibody. Binding affinity of the antibodies was determined in accordance with the Scatchard analysis methodology initially described in \nMunson et al., Anal. Biochem. 107:220 (1980\n). The results of this experiment are shown in Table 3 below.\n\n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \nClone\n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2\n \n0.348\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H6\n \n0.404\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Kd of YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 is higher for TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3 cells compared with recombinant TAT226-His (compare Kds for YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H in tables 2 and 3), indicating that YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 bind with slightly higher affinity to recombinant TAT226-His than to TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3 cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nF. TAT226 mRNA and Protein Expression\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTAT226 mRNA expression in OVCAR3 cells and in a panel of ovarian cancer samples was analyzed using a 5' nuclease (TaqManÂ®) assay and real-time quantitative PCR. The ovarian cancer samples, designated \"HF ####\" in \nFigure 16\n, were frozen tissue sections. RNA was isolated from the tissue sections, amplified using Ambion's Message Amp II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and reverse transcribed into cDNA. RNA was isolated from OVCAR3 cells and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. TAT226 cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR in the presence of a non-extendible, reporter probe specific for the amplification product. The threshold cycle or \"Ct\" (the cycle in which the signal generated from cleavage of the reporter probe exceeded background) was determined and used to calculate starting TAT226 mRNA levels. The level of TAT226 mRNA in the panel of ovarian cancer samples was expressed relative to the level of TAT226 mRNA in OVCAR3 cells, as shown in the bar graph in \nFigure 16\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTAT226 protein expression in OVCAR3 cells and in the above panel of ovarian cancer samples was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as follows. Tissue sections (frozen or paraffin-embedded) of the ovarian cancer samples were fixed for 5 minutes in acetone/ethanol. The sections were washed in PBS, blocked with avidin and biotin (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 10 minutes each, and washed in PBS again. The sections were then blocked with 10% serum for 20 minutes and blotted to remove excess serum. Primary antibody (YWO.49.H2 or YWO.49.H6) was then added to the sections at a concentration of 10Âµg/ml for 1 hour. The sections were then washed in PBS. Biotinylated secondary anti-human antibody was added to the sections for 30 minutes, and then the sections were washed with PBS. The sections were then exposed to the reagents of the Vector ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 30 minutes and then washed in PBS. The sections were then exposed to diaminobenzidine (Pierce) for 5 minutes and then washed in PBS. The sections were then counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin, covered with a coverslip, and visualized. IHC was performed on OVCAR3 cells using the same protocol, except that the cells were first pelleted, frozen, and then sectioned. The sections were then subjected to the above protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are reported qualitatively in \nFigure 16\n, with expression levels categorized as \"-\", \"+/-\", or \"+\". Generally, there was an overall correlation between the level of TAT226 mRNA expression and the expression of TAT226 protein on the surface of OVCAR3 cells. The IHC experiments also confirmed that the antibodies recognized TAT226 on the cell surface. The histology of each cell in the ovarian cancer cell panel is also reported in \nFigure 16\n, with the abbreviation \"adenoca.\" denoting \"adenocarcinoma.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nG. Production of Anti-TAT226 ADCs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 ADCs were produced by conjugating YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 to the following drug-linker moieties: MC-vc-PAB-MMAE; MC-vc-PAB-MMAF; and MC-MMAF, which are depicted above in Section III.C.1.b.2. Prior to conjugation, the antibodies were partially reduced with TCEP using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in \n \nWO 2004/010957 A2\n \n. The partially reduced antibodies were conjugated to the above drug-linker moieties using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in \nDoronina et al. (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21:778-784\n and \n \nUS 2005/0238649 A1\n \n. Briefly, the partially reduced antibodies were combined with the drug linker moieties to allow conjugation of the moieties to cysteine residues. The conjugation reactions were quenched, and the ADCs were purified. The drug load (average number of drug moieties per antibody) for each ADC was determined by HPLC, as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nADC\n \n \n \nDrug load\n \n \n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE\n \n3.8\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF\n \n4.7\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2-MC-MMAF\n \n4.9\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE\n \n4.4\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF\n \n4.4\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF\n \n4.1\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nH. Cell Killing Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) were tested for the ability to inhibit proliferation of cells expressing TAT226 in the following \nin vitro\n and \nin\n vivo cell killing assays:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n1. OVCAR3 in vitro cell killing assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 ADCs were tested for the ability to inhibit proliferation of OVCAR3 cells. OVCAR3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in RPMI with 20% FBS. OVCAR3 cells at a density of 3000 cells per well were incubated with varying concentrations of the ADCs, as shown in \nFigure 17\n. Anti-MUC16/CA125 antibody conjugated to MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was used as a positive control. MUC16/CA125 is a known ovarian cancer antigen. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nYin et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276:27371-27375\n. Anti-IL-8 antibody conjugated to MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was used as a negative control. After 5 days of incubation, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Gloâ¢ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The scale on the Î³-axis of \nFigure 17\n indicates the relative light units, or \"RLUs,\" from luciferase luminescence, which is a measure of cell viability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17\n shows that, similar to the positive control, YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF had marked cell killing activity, particularly at concentrations at and around 0.01 and 0.1 Âµg/ml. YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE also had cell killing activity, but to a lesser extent than seen with YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF. The IC\n50\n for YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF was about 0.005 nM, and the IC\n50\n for YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was about 0.2 nM. The IC\n50\n for free MMAE was about 0.1 nM. YWO.49.H2-MC-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF did not demonstrate significant cell killing activity in this assay. In this particular assay system, it is noted that at high concentrations of ADC, including negative control ADC, cell viability decreases substantially due to the overall high concentration of MMAE and MMAF.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. In vitro cell killing assay using HCT116 transfected cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 ADCs were tested for the ability to inhibit proliferation of HCT116 cells, a colon cancer cell line, which had been stably transfected with nucleic acid encoding human TAT226. Untransfected HCT116 cells are normally about 5-6 fold less sensitive to free (unconjugated) MMAE than OVCAR3 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, HCT116 cells were transfected as follows. Nucleic acid encoding epitope-tagged human TAT226 was constructed in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The epitope tag consisted of amino acids 1-53 of the herpes \nsimplex virus type\n 1 glycoprotein D (the \"gD\" tag), which replaced the signal sequence from amino acids 1-22 at the N-terminus of human TAT226. The recombinant vector was transfected into HCT116 cells using Lipofectamine200 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% FBS and 0.4 mg/ml G418. Cells were stained using anti-gD antibodies and sorted by FACS to select for individual clones expressing recombinant gD:human TAT226 fusion protein. One of the clones, designated HCT116#9-4, was selected for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo perform the cell killing assay, HCT116#9-4 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. HCT116#9-4 cells at a density of 1000 cells per well were incubated with varying concentrations of the ADCs, as shown in \nFigure 18\n. Anti-gp120 antibody conjugated to MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was used as a negative control. After 3 days of incubation, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Gloâ¢ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 18\n shows that YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF had marked cell killing activity, particularly at about 0.01 Âµg/ml and up to the highest concentrations tested. The IC\n50\n for YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF was about 0.05 nM, and the IC\n50\n for free MMAE was about 0.9 nM. YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE did not have substantial cell killing activity relative to the negative control in this particular assay. The difference between the cell killing activity of YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE in this assay compared to the OVCAR3 cell killing assay (above) may be attributable to a variety of factors, e.g., cell density and/or differences in drug sensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that for some other cell lines tested that normally express TAT226 mRNA or protein, YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 ADCs did not show significant cell killing activity. This could be due to a variety of factors, e.g., cell type-specific effects, levels of cell surface TAT226 expression, and/or differences in drug sensitivity.\n\n\n \n\n\n3. In vivo assay using HCT116#9-4 xenograft\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn in vivo xenograft model was used to test unconjugated and conjugated YWO.49.H6 for the ability to inhibit proliferation of TAT226-expressing tumor cells in vivo. Tumors were induced in athymic nude \"nu-nu\" mice by subcutaneous injection of about 5x10\n6\n HCT116#9-4 cells into the dorsal flanks of the mice. Tumors were allowed to grow until they reached a mean tumor volume of 200 mm\n3\n. That point in time was designated as \"\nday\n 0.\" As shown in \nFigure 19\n, the mice received intravenous injections of 3 mg/kg of the indicated unconjugated antibodies or ADCs on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 0, 7, and 16. Unconjugated and conjugated anti-ragweed antibodies (Ab) served as negative controls. Mean tumor volume was measured on \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n 3, 7, 10, 16, and 21. As shown in \nFigure19\n, YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF showed significant tumor cell killing activity, as measured by mean tumor volume, compared to anti-ragweed Ab-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF in this particular xenograft model. YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE did not show significant tumor cell killing activity relative to anti-ragweed Ab-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE in this xenograft model. However, this xenograft model may not reflect the cell killing activity of YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE observed in vitro for a variety of factors, e.g., due to differences in drug sensitivity or expression levels of cell surface TAT226 in the xenograft tumor microenvironment.\n\n\n \n\n\n4. Other xenograft models\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOther xenograft models may be used to test unconjugated and conjugated anti-TAT226 antibodies for the ability to inhibit proliferation of TAT226-expressing tumor cells in vivo. For example, xenograft models for ovarian and brain tumors may be provided by public sources such as Oncotest GmbH (Frieberg, Germany) and Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL). The Oncotest models in particular were developed by growing patient tumors in immune-deficient nude mice. Xenografts that express TAT226 mRNA and/or protein may be useful for demonstrating cell killing activity of anti-TAT226 antibodies in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugated YWO.49.H6 was tested in the Oncotest model OVXF1023 for the ability to inhibit proliferation of ovarian tumor cells in vivo. The Oncotest model OVXF1023 is derived from a metastasized poorly differentiated papillary serous adenomatous ovarian carcinoma, stage M1. OVXF1023 mice were treated with the ADCs indicated in \nFigure 20\n. In \nFigure 20\n, YWO.49.H6 is designated as \"H6\"; anti-ragweed (control) antibody is designated as \"RW\"; and the linker -MC-vc-PAB- is abbreviated as \"vc.\" The ADCs were administered on the days and at the concentrations indicated in \nFigure 20\n. The results shown in \nFigure 20\n indicate that YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB.-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF significantly reduced tumor volume relative to the other ADCs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above experiment was repeated with OVXF1023 under similar conditions but with changes in dosing and in the control ADCs. In the repeat experiment, mice were treated with a higher dose (5 mg/kg) of YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and with lower doses (5 mg/kg) of YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF. The results demonstrated that the H6 ADCs (and in particular YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) showed reduced tumor volume relative to their respective control ADCs (anti-gp120-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE at 6.4 mg/kg; anti-gp120-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF at 7.2 mg/kg; and anti-gp120-MC-MMAF at 5.4 mg/kg), although the difference in efficacy between the H6 ADCs and their respective control ADCs was not statistically significant for some data points. (Data not shown.) The difference between these results and the results obtained in the first OVXF1023 experiment may be attributable to the differences in dosing of the H6 ADCs and the observation that the control anti-gp120 ADCs showed unexpected activity in reducing tumor volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the H6 ADCs were also tested in another Oncotest model, OVXF899, which is derived from a moderately differentiated papillary serous ovarian carcinoma (primary tumor). The H6 ADCs did not reduce tumor volume in this model. (Data not shown.) However, this particular Oncotest model showed low expression of TAT226, which may account for the observed results.\n\n\n \n\n\nI. ThioMAbs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCysteine engineered antibodies, or \"thioMAbs,\" were created in which a selected residue of YWO.49.H6 was substituted with cysteine in order to provide an additional site for conjugation of a linker-drug moiety. Specifically, an A118C substitution (EU numbering) was made in the heavy chain of YWO.49.H6, or a V205C substitution (Kabat numbering) was made in the light chain of YWO.49.H6. The resulting A118C thioMAb was then conjugated to MC-MMAF, and the resulting V205C thioMAb was then conjugated to either MC-MMAF or MC-vc-PAB-MMAE. All thioMAbs were capable of binding to OVCAR3 cells by FACS analysis. (Data not shown.)"
