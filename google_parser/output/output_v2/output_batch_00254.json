Discussion of Relevant Technology\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPain management has been an important field of study for many years. It has been well known that cannabinoid receptor (e.g., CB\n1 \nreceptor, CB\n2 \nreceptor) ligands including agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists produce relief of pain in a variety of animal models by interacting with CB\n1 \nand/or CB\n2 \nreceptors. Generally, CB\n1 \nreceptors are located predominately in the central nervous system, whereas CB\n2 \nreceptors are located primarily in the periphery and are primarily restricted to the cells and tissues derived from the immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile CB\n1 \nreceptor agonists, such as Δ\n9\n-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ\n9\n-THC) and anadamide, are useful in anti-nociception models in animals, they tend to exert undesired CNS side effects, e.g., psychoactive side effects, the abuse potential, drug dependence and tolerance, etc. These undesired side effects are known to be mediated by the CB\n1 \nreceptors located in CNS. There are lines of evidence, however, suggesting that CB1 agonists acting at peripheral sites or with limited CNS exposure can manage pain in humans or animals with much improved overall in vivo profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there is a need for new CB\n1 \nreceptor ligands such as agonists that may be useful in managing pain or treating other related symptoms or diseases with reduced or minimal undesirable CNS side effects.\n\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides CB\n1 \nreceptor ligands which may be useful in treating pain and/or other related symptoms or diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless specified otherwise within this specification, the nomenclature used in this specification generally follows the examples and rules stated in \nNomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Sections A, B, C, D, E, F, and H\n, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1979, which is incorporated by references herein for its exemplary chemical structure names and rules on naming chemical structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “C\nm-n\n,” or “C\nm-n\n, group” used alone or as a prefix, refers to any group having m to n carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hydrocarbon” used alone or as a suffix or prefix, refers to any structure comprising only carbon and hydrogen atoms up to 14 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hydrocarbon radical” or “hydrocarbyl” used alone or as a suffix or prefix, refers to any structure as a result of removing one or more hydrogens from a hydrocarbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” used alone or as a suffix or prefix, refers to a saturated monovalent straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical comprising 1 to about 12 carbon atoms.

The present invention includes any possible enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or mixtures thereof, of a compound of Formula I. The optically active forms of the compound of the invention may be prepared, for example, by chiral chromatographic separation of a racemate, by synthesis from optically active starting materials or by asymmetric synthesis based on the procedures described thereafter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be appreciated that certain compounds of the present invention may exist as geometrical isomers, for example E and Z isomers of alkenes. The present invention includes any geometrical isomer of a compound of Formula I. It will further be understood that the present invention encompasses tautomers of the compounds of the formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be understood that certain compounds of the present invention may exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated forms. It will further be understood that the present invention encompasses all such solvated forms of the compounds of the formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin the scope of the invention are also salts of the compounds of the formula I. Generally, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present invention may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound, for example an alkyl amine with a suitable acid, for example, HCl or acetic acid, to afford a physiologically acceptable anion. It may also be possible to make a corresponding alkali metal (such as sodium, potassium, or lithium) or an alkaline earth metal (such as a calcium) salt by treating a compound of the present invention having a suitably acidic proton, such as a carboxylic acid or a phenol with one equivalent of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or alkoxide (such as the ethoxide or methoxide), or a suitably basic organic amine (such as choline or meglumine) in an aqueous medium, followed by conventional purification techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compound of formula I above may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, particularly, an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate, tartrate, citrate, methanesulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have now found that the compounds of the invention have activity as pharmaceuticals, in particular as modulators or ligands such as agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonist or antagonists of CB\n1 \nreceptors. More particularly, the compounds of the invention exhibit activity as agonist of the CB\n1 \nreceptors and are useful in therapy, especially for relief of various pain conditions such as chronic pain, neuropathic pain, acute pain, cancer pain, pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, visceral pain etc. This list should however not be interpreted as exhaustive. Additionally, compounds of the present invention are useful in other disease states in which dysfunction of CB\n1 \nreceptors is present or implicated. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and cardiavascular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are useful as immunomodulators, especially for autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis, for skin grafts, organ transplants and similar surgical needs, for collagen diseases, various allergies, for use as anti-tumour agents and anti viral agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are useful in disease states where degeneration or dysfunction of cannabinoid receptors is present or implicated in that paradigm. This may involve the use of isotopically labeled versions of the compounds of the invention in diagnostic techniques and imaging applications such as positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of diarrhea, depression, anxiety and stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and obsessive compulsive disorder, urinary incontinence, premature ejaculation, various mental illnesses, cough, lung edema, various gastro-intestinal disorders, e.g. constipation, functional gastrointestinal disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Functional Dyspepsia, Parkinson's disease and other motor disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardioprotection following miocardial infarction, spinal injury and drug addiction, including the treatment of alcohol, nicotine, opioid and other drug abuse and for disorders of the sympathetic nervous system for example hypertension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are useful as an analgesic agent for use during general anaesthesia and monitored anaesthesia care. Combinations of agents with different properties are often used to achieve a balance of effects needed to maintain the anesthetic state (e.g. amnesia, analgesia, muscle relaxation and sedation). Included in this combination are inhaled anesthetics, hypnotics, anxiolytics, neuromuscular blockers and opioids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound according to Formula I, for the inhibition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) and thus for treatment or prevention of gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD). The major mechanism behind reflux has been considered to depend on a hypotonic lower esophageal sphincter. However, e.g. \nHolloway \n& \nDent \n(1990) \nGastroenterol. Clin. N. Amer. \n19, pp. 517-535, has shown that most reflux episodes occur during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs), i.e. relaxations not triggered by swallows. In yet further embodiments of the present invention, the compound according to Formula I are useful for the prevention of reflux, treatment or prevention of regurgitation, treatment or prevention of asthma, treatment or prevention of laryngitis, treatment or prevention of lung disease and for the management of failure to thrive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound according to Formula I, for the manufacture of a medicament for the inhibition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, for the treatment or prevention of GERD, for the prevention of reflux, for the treatment or prevention of regurgitation, treatment or prevention of asthma, treatment or prevention of laryngitis, treatment or prevention of lung disease and for the management of failure to thrive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound according to Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia (FD). Yet another aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound according to Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), such as constipation predominant IBS, diarrhea predominant IBS or alternating bowel movement predominant IBS. Exemplary irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD), such as functional dyspepsia (FD), are illustrated in Thompson W G, Longstreth G F, Drossman D A, Heaton K W, Irvine E J, Mueller-Lissner S A. \nC.

The term “therapeutic” and “therapeutically” should be construed accordingly. The term “therapy” within the context of the present invention further encompasses to administer an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, to mitigate either a pre-existing disease state, acute or chronic, or a recurring condition. This definition also encompasses prophylactic therapies for prevention of recurring conditions and continued therapy for chronic disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are useful in therapy, especially for the therapy of various pain conditions including, but not limited to: acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, back pain, cancer pain, and visceral pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn use for therapy in a warm-blooded animal such as a human, the compound of the invention may be administered in the form of a conventional pharmaceutical composition by any route including orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, topically, intranasally, intraperitoneally, intrathoracially, intravenously, epidurally, intrathecally, intracerebroventricularly and by injection into the joints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the route of administration may be oral, intravenous or intramuscular.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage will depend on the route of administration, the severity of the disease, age and weight of the patient and other factors normally considered by the attending physician, when determining the individual regimen and dosage level at the most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solid carrier can be one or more substance, which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet-disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided compound of the invention, or the active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing suppository compositions, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture in then poured into convenient sized molds and allowed to cool and solidify.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term composition is also intended to include the formulation of the active component with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid form compositions include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. For example, sterile water or water propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds may be liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid compositions can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavoring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to therapeutically active hydroxamic and carboxylic acid derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to the use of such compounds in medicine. In particular, the compounds are inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's) are a family of zinc containing endopeptidases which are capable of cleaving large biomolecules such as the collagens, proteoglycans and gelatins. Imbalance between active MMPs and endogenous inhibitors, leads to excessive tissue disruption. The three main groups of MMPs are the collagenases, the gelatinases, and the stromelysins. Collagenases include fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), and collagenase 3 (MMP-13). Gelatinases include 72 kDa gelatinase (gelatinase A; MMP-2) and 92 kDa gelatinase (gelatinase B; MMP-9). Stromelysins include stromelysin 1 (MMP-3), stromelysin 2 (MMP-10) and matrilysin (MMP-7). However there are MMPs which do not fit neatly into the above groups, for example metalloelastase (MMP-12), membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP or MMP-14) and stromelysin 3 (MMP-11).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver-expression and activation of MMPs have been linked with a wide range of diseases such as cancer; rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; chronic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema; cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis; corneal ulceration; dental diseases such as gingivitis and periodontal disease; neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and restenosis. For example, MMP-12 is required for the development of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in mice, Science, 277, 2002 (1997). Inhibition of MMPs is therefore a strategy for treatment of such disease states. However, there is evidence that non-selective inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity may affect normal physiological process leading to dose limiting side effects. Selective inhibition of MMP-12 and/or MMP-9 is thought to be a particularly relevant strategy for intervention in inflammatory conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMMPs can hydrolyse the membrane-bound precursor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a). This cleavage yields mature soluble TNF-a and the inhibitors of MMPs can block production of TNF-a both in vitro and in vivo. This pharmacological action is a probable contributor to the ant-inflammatory action of this class of compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a recent review of MMP inhibition as reflected in the patent literature, see Doherty et. Al. Therapeutic Developments in Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibition; Expert Opinions on Therapeutic Patents, 2002, 12, 665-707.\n\n\n \nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a class of compounds which are inhibitors of MMPs. The class includes compounds which are selective inhibitors of MMP12 relative to the collagenases and stromelysins. In addition, compounds of the invention can exhibit selective activity towards MMP-9. Compounds of the invention are therefore indicated for treatment of diseases primarily mediated by MMP-9 and/or MMP-12, especially inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis and fibrosis.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a bar graph illustrating the average ASAT and ALAT levels for control animals and those treated with the compound of Example 13 at three different dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n is a bar graph illustrating the average area percentages of fibrosis in the livers of animals.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention there is provided compound formula (IA or (IB))\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nW represents HO(C═O)—, HONH(C═O)—, or H(C═O)N(OH)—;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX represents —O— or —S—;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nrepresents\n\n \n \n \n \n \nhydrogen;\n \n—OH or —SH;\n \nfluoro or chloro;\n \n—CF\n3\n;\n \n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n \n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy;\n \n(C\n2\n-C\n6\n)alkenyl;\n \nphenyl or substituted phenyl;\n \nphenyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl or substituted phenyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;

Enzyme Inhibition Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention were tested to assess their activities as inhibitors of MMP9 and MMP12.\n\n\n \nMMP9 Assay Protocol\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds were tested for inhibitory activity against 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP9) in an assay using a coumarin-labelled peptide substrate, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3-[2,4-dinitrophenyl]-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl)-Ala-Arg-NH\n2 \n(McaPLGLDpaAR) (Knight et al, FEBS Lett. 1992; 263-266).\n\n\n \n \nStock Solutions were Made Up as Follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAssay Buffer: 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 0.05% Brij 35\n \nSubstrate: 0.4 mM McaPLGLDpaAR (from Bachem) (0.437 mg/ml) stock solution in 100%\n \nDMSO (stored at −20° C.). Dilute to 8 μM in assay buffer.\n \nEnzyme: Recombinant human 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP-9; APMA (4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate)—activated if necessary) appropriately diluted in assay buffer.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nTest Compounds were prepared initially as 10 mM compound solution in 100% DMSO, diluted to 1 mM in 100% DMSO, then serially diluted 3-fold in 100% DMSO across columns 1-10 of a 96-well microtitre plate Assay concentration range, 100 μM (column 1) to 5.1 nM (column 10)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay was performed in a total volume of 100 μl per well in 96-well microtitre plates. Activated enzyme (20 μl) was added to the wells followed by 20 μl of assay buffer. Appropriate concentrations of test compounds dissolved in 10 μl of DMSO were then added followed by 50 μl of McaPLGLDpaAR (8 μM, prepared by dilution of DMSO stock in assay buffer). For each assay ten concentrations of test compound were examined in duplicate. Control wells lack either enzyme or test compound. The reactions were incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours. The fluorescence at 405 nm was measured immediately with an SLT Fluoatar fluorometer (SLT Labinstruments GmbH, Gröodig, Austria) using 320 nm excitation, without stopping the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of the test compound was determined from the dose response curve generated by the 10 duplicate concentrations of inhibitor. The IC\n50 \n(the concentration of compound required to give a 50% decrease in enzyme activity) was obtained by fitting data to the equation, Y=a+((b−a)/(1+(c/X)\nd\n)). (Y=inhibition achieved for a particular dose; X=the dose in nM; a=minimum y or zero % inhibition; b=maximum y or 100% inhibition; c=is the IC\n50\n; d=is the slope).

CCl\n4\n-Induced Liver Fibrosis Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbon tetrachloride (CCl\n4\n) induces liver fibrosis when administered intraperitoneally (Bulbena O, Culat J, Bravo M L., Inflammation 1997 Oct.; 21(5):475-88). Compounds of the invention can be evaluated for their ability to prevent the CCl\n4\n-induced formation of fibrotic tissue.\n\n\n \nAnimals\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Sprague-Dawley rats, 7 weeks old, weight approx. 300 g from Charles River/Iffa-Crédo, St-Germain/l'Arbresle, France.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats were acclimatised for 5 days before commencing experiments, in air-conditioned rooms, 2 animals per cage, Temperature: 22° C.±2, Relative humidity: 55%±10 Light: 12 hour cycle (7 a.m.-7 p.m.), Cage: Makrolon® cage 42.5×26.6×15 on each fitted with a stainless steel cover-feed rack.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe study involved the following groups of 8 animals each, as indicated below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 1: “Sham” animals received CCl\n4 \nvehicle (i.p.) and once daily, the vehicle of test substance (s.c.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 2: Positive control group received CCl\n4 \n(i.p.), and once daily, the vehicle of the test substance (s.c.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 3: Experimental group received CCl\n4 \n(i.p.), and once daily, 2 mg/kg s.c. of the compound of Example 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 4: Experimental group received CCl\n4 \n(i.p.), and once daily, 10 mg/kg s.c. of the compound of Example 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 5: Experimental group received CCl\n4 \n(i.p.) and once daily, 20 mg/kg s.c. of the compound of Example 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats were labelled on their tails. The labels were checked and renewed, if necessary, after every CCl\n4 \ninjection.\n\n\n \nProcedure\n\n\n \n \n \nCCl\n4 \n(Prolabo) in olive oil was administered every 3 days for three weeks by intraperitoneal injection (0.25 ml CCl\n4\n/kg body weight, diluted in oil 1:1 vol:vol for a total volume of 0.5 ml/kg). Animals were weighed daily. If body weight decreased by more than 10% of the initial weight, the animal was excluded from the study.\n\n\n \n \nVehicles and compound were used as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCCl\n4 \nwas administered in olive oil (prolabo) at a 1:1 dilution;\n \nThe compound of Example 13 was suspended in 0.25% Tween-80 and 0.25% carboxymethylcellulose in sterile 0.9% NaCl. The solution was kept at 4° C. throughout the experiment and used each day to prepare the suspensions.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound of Example 13 was administered daily by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection at a volume of administration of 5 ml/kg. \n \nGroups\n \n 1 and 2 were dosed s.c. with 5 ml/kg of vehicle. Freshly prepared solutions were used on each day of the experiment. Administrations were carried out each day at the same time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment of groups of this study was started for each animal at the time of the first CCl\n4 \nadministration and was continued for 21 consecutive days. The last administration of test substances or vehicle was done 1 day before the sacrifice of the animals.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nDeath was reported for 16 animals. Date and supposed cause are reported in Table 1.\n\n\n \nSerum Enzyme Levels\n\n\n \n \n \nAnimals were killed 21 days following the first CCl\n4 \nadministration by isofurane inhalation. Blood was withdrawn individually at the time of sacrifice, i.e. one day after the last administration of test substance or vehicle. Blood was centrifuged at 4° C. Plasma was carefully collected and aliquoted in 3 fractions. Plasma aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) and alanine amino transferase (ALAT) levels were measured in order to assess liver necrosis. Increased ASAT and ALAT levels in serum are associated with liver impairment. Average ASAT and ALAT levels for control animals and those treated with the compound of Example 13 at three different dosages are shown in \nFIG. 1\n (Y-axis is units of enzyme activity per litre blood, IU/L). Subcutaneous treatment with the compound of Example 13 clearly decreases ASAT and ALAT levels compared to animals treated with vehicle. This demonstrates that the compound of Example 13 has a protective effect on the liver.\n\n\n \nHistological Evaluation of Liver Fibrosis\n\n\n \n \n \nLiver fibrosis was evaluated by measuring the area of fibrosis in the liver using microchotomy. Results are reported as percentage area that was fibrotic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe liver was removed, the three lobes were dissected and samples were removed and either fixed in 10% formaldehyde or frozen at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver sections were embedded in paraffin blocks. Sectioning and staining with Sirius red was performed. Quantification of the fibrosis in liver was carried out on a minimum of 3 sections taken from different locations in the liver. The quantitative analysis was performed using an image analyser (Imstar) and the software Morphostar.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAverage area percentages of fibrosis in the livers of animals in the different groups were calculated, and the results are shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. IL2-Induced Peritoneal Recruitment of Lymphocytes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of IL2 intraperitoneally causes migration of lymphocytes into the intraperitoneal cavity. This is a model for the cellular migration that occurs during inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention inhibit IL2-induced lymphocyte recruitment. Protocol\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC3H/HEN mice (Elevage Janvier, France) were intraperitoneally injected with IL2 (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute, 20 μg/kg, in saline).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention were suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)/0.25% tween-20 and were administered by sc or po route (10 ml/kg) 15 min prior to administration of IL2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwenty-four hours after administration of IL2, peritoneal white blood cells were collected by 3 successive lavages of the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-1 mM EDTA (+4° C.). The suspension was centrifuged (1700 g×10 min at +4° C.). The resulting pellet was suspended in 1 ml PBS-1 mM EDTA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLymphocytes were identified and counted using a Beckman/Coulter counter.\n\n\n \nExperimental Design\n\n\n \n \n \nThe animals were divided into 5 groups (6 mice each group):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 1: (baseline) received 0.5% CMC/0.25% tween-20 (vehicle of compound of the invention) and saline (vehicle of IL2);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 2: (control IL2) received 0.5% CMC/0.25% tween-20 and injection of IL2;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 3: Experimental group (Compound of the invention Dose 1) received a compound of the invention and injection of IL2;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 4: Experimental group (Compound of the invention Dose 2) received a compound of the invention and injection of IL2;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 5: Experimental group (Compound of the invention Dose 3) received a compound of the invention and injection of IL2;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 6: Reference group received reference compound dexamethasone and injection of IL2.\n\n\n \nCalculation\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of lymphocyte recruitment was calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninhibition\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nLyX\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nLy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nLy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere \nLy\n 1=Number of lymphocytes in group 1 (E3/μl), \nLy\n 2=Number of lymphocytes in group 2 (E3/μl), Ly X=Number of lymphocytes in group X (3-5) (E3/μl)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of compound of the invention required to inhibit lymphocyte recruitment by 50% (ID50) was calculated using a curve-fitting routine.
