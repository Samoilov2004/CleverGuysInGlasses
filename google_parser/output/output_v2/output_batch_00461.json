As used herein, \"short interfering nucleic acid\", \"siNA\", or \"short interfering nucleic acid molecule\" has the meaning described in more detail elsewhere herein. \n\n\n[0192] As used herein, the term \"complementary\" means that a nucleic acid can form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid sequence by either traditional Watson-Crick or other non-traditional types. In reference to the nucleic molecules disclosed herein, the binding free energy for a nucleic acid molecule with its complementary sequence is sufficient to allow the relevant function of the nucleic acid to proceed, e.g., RNAi activity. Determination of binding free energies for nucleic acid molecules is well known in the art (see, e.g., Turner et al, 1987, CSH Symp. Quant. Biol. LII pp. 123-133; Frier et al, 1986, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9373-9377; Turner et al, 1987, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109:3783-3785). A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of contiguous residues in a nucleic acid molecule that can form hydrogen bonds (e.g., Watson-Crick base pairing) with a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides out of a total of 10 nucleotides in the first oligonucleotide being based paired to a second nucleic acid sequence having 10 nucleotides represents 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementary respectively). \"Fully complementary\" means that all the contiguous residues of a nucleic acid sequence will hydrogen bond with the same number of contiguous residues in a second nucleic acid sequence. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein includes about 15 to about 35 or more (e.g., about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 or 35 or more) nucleotides that are complementary to one or more target nucleic acid molecules or a portion thereof. \n\n\n[0193] As used herein, the term \"sense region\" refers to a nucleotide sequence of a siNA molecule complementary (partially or fully) to an antisense region of the siNA molecule. The sense strand of a siNA molecule can include a nucleic acid sequence having homology with a target nucleic acid sequence. As used herein, \"sense strand\" refers to nucleic acid molecule that includes a sense region and may also include additional nucleotides. \n\n [0194] As used herein, the term \"antisense region\" refers to a nucleotide sequence of a siNA molecule complementary (partially or fully) to a target nucleic acid sequence. The antisense strand of a siNA molecule can optionally include a nucleic acid sequence complementary to a sense region of the siNA molecule. As used herein, \"antisense strand\" refers to nucleic acid molecule that includes an antisense region and may also include additional nucleotides. \n\n\n[0195] As used herein, the term \"RNA\" refers to a molecule that includes at least one ribonucleotide residue. \n\n\n[0196] As used herein, the term \"duplex region\" refers to the region in two \n\n\ncomplementary or substantially complementary oligonucleotides that form base pairs with one another, either by Watson-Crick base pairing or any other manner that allows for a duplex between oligonucleotide strands that are complementary or substantially complementary. For example, an oligonucleotide strand having 21 nucleotide units can base pair with another oligonucleotide of 21 nucleotide units, yet only 19 bases on each strand are complementary or substantially complementary, such that the \"duplex region\" consists of 19 base pairs. The remaining base pairs may, for example, exist as 5' and 3' overhangs. Further, within the duplex region, 100% complementarity is not required; substantial complementarity is allowable within a duplex region. Substantial complementarity refers to complementarity between the strands such that they are capable of annealing under biological conditions. \n\n\nTechniques to empirically determine if two strands are capable of annealing under biological conditions are well know in the art. Alternatively, two strands can be synthesized and added together under biological conditions to determine if they anneal to one another. \n\n\n[0197] As used herein, the terms \"non-pairing nucleotide analog\" means a nucleotide analog which includes a non-base pairing moiety including but not limited to: 6 des amino adenosine (Nebularine), 4-Me-indole, 3-nitropyrrole, 5-nitroindole, Ds, Pa, N3-Me ribo U, N3-Me riboT, N3-Me dC, N3-Me-dT, Nl-Me-dG, Nl-Me-dA, N3-ethyl-dC, N3-Me dC. In some embodiments the non-base pairing nucleotide analog is a ribonucleotide. In other embodiments it is a deoxyribonucleotide. \n\n\n[0198] As used herein, the term, \"terminal functional group\" includes without limitation a halogen, alcohol, amine, carboxylic, ester, amide, aldehyde, ketone, ether groups. \n\n [0199] An \"abasic nucleotide\" or \"abasic nucleotide analog\" is as used herein may also be often referred to herein and in the art as a pseudo-nucleotide or an unconventional moiety. While a nucleotide is a monomeric unit of nucleic acid, generally consisting of a ribose or deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and a base (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine in DNA; adenine, guanine, uracil, or cytosine in R A). an abasic or pseudo-nucleotide lacks a base, and thus is not strictly a nucleotide as the term is generally used in the art. Abasic deoxyribose moieties include for example, abasic deoxyribose-3 ' -phosphate; 1,2-dideoxy-D- ribofuranose-3 -phosphate; l,4-anhydro-2-deoxy-D-ribitol-3-phosphate. Inverted abasic deoxyribose moieties include inverted deoxyriboabasic; 3 ',5' inverted deoxyabasic 5'- phosphate. \n\n\n[0200] The term \"capping moiety\" (z\") as used herein includes a moiety which can be covalently linked to the 5' terminus of (N')y and includes abasic ribose moiety, abasic deoxyribose moiety, modifications abasic ribose and abasic deoxyribose moieties including 2' O alkyl modifications; inverted abasic ribose and abasic deoxyribose moieties and \n\n\nmodifications thereof; C6-imino-Pi; a mirror nucleotide including L-DNA and L-RNA; \n\n\n5'OMe nucleotide; and nucleotide analogs including 4',5 '-methylene nucleotide; 1-(β-ϋ- erythrofuranosyl)nucleotide; 4'-thio nucleotide, carbocyc lie nucleotide; 5'-amino-alkyl phosphate; l,3-diamino-2-propyl phosphate, 3-aminopropyl phosphate; 6-aminohexyl phosphate; 12-aminododecyl phosphate; hydroxypropyl phosphate; 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleotide; alpha-nucleotide; threo-pentofuranosyl nucleotide; acyclic 3',4'-seco nucleotide; 3,4-dihydroxybutyl nucleotide; 3,5-dihydroxypentyl nucleotide, 5 '-5 '-inverted abasic moiety; 1 ,4-butanediol phosphate; 5'-amino; and bridging or non bridging methylphosphonate and 5'- mercapto moieties. \n\n\n[0201] Certain capping moieties may be abasic ribose or abasic deoxyribose moieties; inverted abasic ribose or abasic deoxyribose moieties; C6-amino-Pi; a mirror nucleotide including L-DNA and L-RNA. The nucleic acid molecules as disclosed herein may be synthesized using one or more inverted nucleotides, for example inverted thymidine or inverted adenine (for example see Takei, et al., 2002. JBC 277(26):23800-06). \n\n\n[0202] The term \"unconventional moiety\" as used herein refers to non-nucleotide moieties including an abasic moiety, an inverted abasic moiety, a hydrocarbon (alkyl) moiety and derivatives thereof, and further includes a deoxyribonucleotide, a modified \n\n\ndeoxyribonucleotide, a mirror nucleotide (L-DNA or L-RNA), a non-base pairing nucleotide \n\n analog and a nucleotide joined to an adjacent nucleotide by a 2'-5' internucleotide phosphate bond; bridged nucleic acids including LNA and ethylene bridged nucleic acids, linkage modified (e.g. PACE) and base modified nucleotides as well as additional moieties explicitly disclosed herein as unconventional moieties. \n\n\n[0203] As used herein, the term \"inhibit\", \"down-regulate\", or \"reduce\" with respect to gene expression means the expression of the gene, or level of RNA molecules or equivalent R A molecules encoding one or more proteins or protein subunits (e.g., mRNA), or activity of one or more proteins or protein subunits, is reduced below that observed in the absence of an inhibitory factor (such as a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., an siNA, for example having structural features as described herein); for example the expression may be reduced to 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or less than that observed in the absence of an inhibitor. \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES \n\n\n[0204] Fig. 1 is a bar graph showing the effect of GFP siNA on various reporter cell lines. Cell lines were established by lenti-viral induction of human HSP47 cDNA-GFP or rat GP46 cDNA-GFP construct into HEK293, human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, human HSC line hTERT or NR cell line. Negative control siNA or siNA against GFP was introduced into the cells and GFP fluorescence was measured. The results showed that siNA against GFP knocks down the fluorescence to different extent in different cell lines. 293 HSP47-GFP and 293 GP46-GFP cell lines were selected for siHsp47 screening due to their easiness of being transfected and sensitivity to fluorescence knockdown. \n\n\n[0205] Fig. 2 is a series of bar graphs showing the cytotoxicity and knockdown efficiency of various siHsp47s in 293 HSP47-GFP and 293 GP46-GFP cell lines. The result showed that siHsp47-C, siHsp47-2 and siHsp47-2d efficiently knockdown both human HSP47 and rat GP46 (the human hsp47 homolog) without substantial cytotoxicity. siGp46A against GP46 does not knock down human HSP47. Additionally, the newly designed siHsp47s \n\n\noutperformed siGp46A in knocking down rat GP46. \n\n\n[0206] Fig. 3 is a bar graph showing the knock down effect of various siHsp47s on hsp47 mRNA, measured by TaqMan® qPCR using the human HSC cell line hTERT. The Y axis represents the remaining mRNA level of hsp47. HSP47-C was most effective among all the hsp47 siNAs tested. \n\n [0207] Fig. 4 is a bar graph showing the effect of different hsp47 siNAs on collagen I expression in hTERT cells. The level of collagen I mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR using TaqMan® probe. The Y axis represents the remaining mRNA expression level of collagen I. The result showed that collagen I mRNA level is significantly reduced in the cells treated with some of the candidates (siHsp47-2, siHsp47-2d, and their combination with siHsp47-l). \n\n\n[0208] Fig. 5 shows the decrease in fibrotic areas of the liver in animals treated with siHSP47. \n\n\n[0209] Fig. 6 is an exemplary nucleic acid sequence of human hsp47 mRNA cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 1; based on the cDNA disclosed in GenBank accession number: NM 001235). \n\n\n[0210] Fig. 7 is an exemplary amino acid sequence of human hsp47 (SEQ ID NO:2). \n\n\n[0211] Fig. 8 is protein coding nucleic acid sequence of human hsp47 cDNA (SEQ ID NO:59), which corresponds to nucleotides 230-1486 of SEQ ID NO: 1. \n\n\n[0212] Figs. 9A-9I show plasma stability of Compound l, Compound_2 , Compound_3, Compound_4, Compound_5, Compound_6 , Compound_7, Compound_8 and Compound_9, respectively, as detected by ethidium bromide staining. \n\n\n[0213] Figs. 1 OA- 101 show ontarget/off-target activity of Compound l, Compound_2 , Compound_3, Compound_4, Compound_5, Compound_6 , Compound_7, Compound_8 and Compound_9, respectively. AS CM shows activity of antisense strand of compound to a plasmid comprising a full match insert; AS SM shows activity of antisense strand of compound to a plasmid comprising seed sequence insert; S CM shows activity of sense strand of compound to a plasmid comprising a full match insert. All assays were performed in human cells, except for data shown in Fig. 10F which was performed in rat REF52 cells. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION RNA Interference and siNA Nucleic Acid Molecules \n\n\n[0214] RNA interference refers to the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Zamore et al., 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Fire et al, 1998, Nature, 391, 806; Hamilton et al, 1999, Science, 286, 950- \n\n 951; Lin et al, 1999, Nature, 402, 128-129; Sharp, 1999, Genes & Dev., 13: 139-141; and Strauss, 1999, Science, 286, 886). The corresponding process in plants (Heifetz et al, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/61631) is often referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA silencing. The process of post-transcriptional gene silencing is thought to be an evolutionarily-conserved cellular defense mechanism used to prevent the expression of foreign genes (Fire et al, 1999, Trends Genet., 15, 358). Such protection from foreign gene expression may have evolved in response to the production of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) derived from viral infection or from the random integration of transposon elements into a host genome via a cellular response that specifically destroys homologous single-stranded RNA or viral genomic RNA. The presence of dsRNA in cells triggers the RNAi response through a mechanism that has yet to be fully characterized. This mechanism appears to be different from other known mechanisms involving double stranded RNA- specific ribonucleases, such as the interferon response that results from dsRNA-mediated activation of protein kinase PKR and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase resulting in non-specific cleavage of mRNA by ribonuclease L (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,107,094; 5,898,031; Clemens et al, 1997, J. Interferon & Cytokine Res., 17, 503-524; Adah et al, 2001, Curr. Med. Chem., 8, 1189). \n\n\n[0215] The presence of long dsRNAs in cells stimulates the activity of a ribonuclease III enzyme referred to as dicer (Bass, 2000, Cell, 101, 235; Zamore et al, 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Hammond et al, 2000, Nature, 404, 293). Dicer is involved in the processing of the dsRNA into short pieces of dsRNA known as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Zamore et al, 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Bass, 2000, Cell, 101, 235; Berstein et al, 2001, Nature, 409, 363). Short interfering RNAs derived from dicer activity are typically about 21 to about 23 nucleotides in length and include about 19 base pair duplexes (Zamore et al, 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; \n\n\nElbashir et al., 2001, Genes Dev., 15, 188). Dicer has also been implicated in the excision of 21- and 22-nucleotide small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) from precursor RNA of conserved structure that are implicated in translational control (Hutvagner et al., 2001, Science, 293, 834). The RNAi response also features an endonuclease complex, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded RNA having sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA takes place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex (Elbashir et al, 2001, Genes Dev., 15, 188). \n\n [0216] RNAi has been studied in a variety of systems. Fire et al, 1998, Nature, 391, 806, were the first to observe RNAi in C. elegans. Bahramian and Zarbl, 1999, Molecular and Cellular Biology, 19, 274-283 and Wianny and Goetz, 1999, Nature Cell Biol, 2, 70, describe RNAi mediated by dsRNA in mammalian systems. Hammond et al., 2000, Nature, 404, 293, describe RNAi in Drosophila cells transfected with dsRNA. Elbashir et al., 2001, Nature, 411 , 494 and Tuschl et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 01/75164, describe RNAi induced by introduction of duplexes of synthetic 21 -nucleotide RNAs in cultured mammalian cells including human embryonic kidney and HeLa cells. Recent work in Drosophila embryonic lysates (Elbashir et al., 2001, EMBO J., 20, 6877 and Tuschl et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 01/75164) has revealed certain requirements for siRNA length, structure, chemical composition, and sequence that are essential to mediate efficient RNAi activity. \n\n\n[0217] Nucleic acid molecules (for example having structural features as disclosed herein) may inhibit or down regulate gene expression or viral replication by mediating RNA interference \"RNAi\" or gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner; see e.g., Zamore et al., 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Bass, 2001, Nature, 411, 428-429; Elbashir et al, 2001, Nature, 411, 494-498; and Kreutzer et al, International PCT Pubhcation No. WO 00/44895; Zernicka- Goetz et al, International PCT Publication No. WO 01/36646; Fire, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/32619; Plaetinck et al, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/01846; Mello and Fire, International PCT Publication No. WO 01/29058; Deschamps- Depaillette, International PCT Pubhcation No. WO 99/07409; and Li et al, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44914; Allshire, 2002, Science, 297, 1818-1819; Volpe et al, 2002, Science, 297, 1833-1837; Jenuwein, 2002, Science, 297, 2215-2218; and Hall et al, 2002, Science, 297, 2232-2237; Hutvagner and Zamore, 2002, Science, 297, 2056-60; McManus et al, 2002, RNA, 8, 842-850; Reinhart et al, 2002, Gene & Dev., 16, 1616-1626; and Reinhart & Bartel, 2002, Science, 297, 1831). \n\n\n[0218] An siNA nucleic acid molecule can be assembled from two separate \n\n\npolynucleotide strands, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand in which the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary (i.e. each strand includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand); such as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure having any length and structure as described herein for nucleic acid molecules as provided, for example wherein the double stranded region (duplex region) is about 15 to about \n\n 49 (e.g., about 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, or 49 base pairs); the antisense strand includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule (i.e., hsp47 mR A) or a portion thereof and the sense strand includes nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof (e.g., about 17 to about 49 or more nucleotides of the nucleic acid molecules herein are complementary to the target nucleic acid or a portion thereof). \n\n\n[0219] In certain aspects and embodiments a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a siNA molecule) provided herein may be a \"RISC length\" molecule or may be a Dicer substrate as described in more detail below. \n\n\n[0220] An siNA nucleic acid molecule may include separate sense and antisense sequences or regions, where the sense and antisense regions are covalently linked by nucleotide or non-nucleotide linkers molecules as is known in the art, or are alternately non- covalently linked by ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and/or stacking interactions. Nucleic acid molecules may include a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence of a target gene. Nucleic acid molecules may interact with nucleotide sequence of a target gene in a manner that causes inhibition of expression of the target gene. \n\n\n[0221] Alternatively, an siNA nucleic acid molecule is assembled from a single polynucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and antisense regions of the nucleic acid molecules are linked by means of a nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s), i.e., the antisense strand and the sense strand are part of one single polynucleotide that having an antisense region and sense region that fold to form a duplex region (for example to form a \"hairpin\" structure as is well known in the art). Such siNA nucleic acid molecules can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a sequence of hsp47 mRNA). Such siNA nucleic acid molecules can be a circular single-stranded polynucleotide having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region includes nucleotide sequence that is \n\n complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active nucleic acid molecule capable of mediating R Ai. \n\n\n[0222] The following nomenclature is often used in the art to describe lengths and overhangs of siNA molecules and may be used throughout the specification and Examples. Names given to duplexes indicate the length of the oligomers and the presence or absence of overhangs. For example, a \"21+2\" duplex contains two nucleic acid strands both of which are 21 nucleotides in length, also termed a 21-mer siRNA duplex or a 21-mer nucleic acid and having a 2 nucleotides 3 '-overhang. A \"21-2\" design refers to a 21-mer nucleic acid duplex with a 2 nucleotides 5 '-overhang. A 21-0 design is a 21-mer nucleic acid duplex with no overhangs (blunt). A \"21+2UU\" is a 21-mer duplex with 2- nucleotides 3 '-overhang and the terminal 2 nucleotides at the 3 '-ends are both U residues (which may result in mismatch with target sequence). The aforementioned nomenclature can be applied to siNA molecules of various lengths of strands, duplexes and overhangs (such as 19-0, 21+2, 27+2, and the like). In an alternative but similar nomenclature, a \"25/27\" is an asymmetric duplex having a 25 base sense strand and a 27 base antisense strand with a 2- nucleotides 3 '-overhang. A \"27/25\" is an asymmetric duplex having a 27 base sense strand and a 25 base antisense strand. \n\n\nChemical Modifications \n\n\n[0223] In certain aspects and embodiments, nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) as provided herein include one or more modifications (or chemical modifications). In certain embodiments, such modifications include any changes to a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide that would make the molecule different than a standard ribonucleotide or RNA molecule (i.e., that includes standard adenosine, cytosine, uracil, or guanosine moieties); which may be referred to as an \"unmodified\" ribonucleotide or unmodified ribonucleic acid. Traditional DNA bases and polynucleotides having a 2'-deoxy sugar represented by adenosine, cytosine, thymine, or guanosine moieties may be referred to as an \"unmodified deoxyribonucleotide\" or \"unmodified deoxyribonucleic acid\"; accordingly, the term \n\n\n\"unmodified nucleotide\" or \"unmodified nucleic acid\" as used herein refers to an \"unmodified ribonucleotide\" or \"unmodified ribonucleic acid\" unless there is a clear indication to the contrary. Such modifications can be in the nucleotide sugar, nucleotide base, nucleotide phosphate group and/or the phosphate backbone of a polynucleotide. \n\n [0224] In certain embodiments modifications as disclosed herein may be used to increase RNAi activity of a molecule and/or to increase the in vivo stability of the molecules, particularly the stability in serum, and/or to increase bioavailability of the molecules. Non- limiting examples of modifications include without limitation internucleotide or \n\n\ninternucleoside linkages; deoxynucleotides or dideoxyribonucleotides at any position and strand of the nucleic acid molecule; nucleic acid (e.g., ribonucleic acid) with a modification at the 2 '-position preferably selected from an amino, fluoro, methoxy, alkoxy and alkyl; 2'- deoxyribonucleotides, 2'-0-methyl ribonucleotides, 2 '-deoxy-2' -fluoro ribonucleotides, \"universal base\" nucleotides, \"acyclic\" nucleotides, 5-C-methyl nucleotides, biotin group, and terminal glyceryl and/or inverted deoxy abasic residue incorporation, sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Other nucleotides modifiers could include 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'- dideoxyinosine (ddl), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC), 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'- dideoxythymidi- ne (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dide-oxythymidine (d4T). Further details on various modifications are described in more detail below. \n\n\n[0225] Modified nucleotides include those having a Northern conformation (e.g., \n\n\nNorthern pseudorotation cycle, see for example Saenger, Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer- Verlag ed., 1984). Non-limiting examples of nucleotides having a northern configuration include locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides (e.g., 2'-0, 4'-C-methylene-(D- ribofuranosyl) nucleotides); 2' -methoxy ethoxy (MOE) nucleotides; 2'-methyl-thio-ethyl, 2'- deoxy-2' -fluoro nucleotides, 2' -deoxy-2 '-chloro nucleotides, 2'-azido nucleotides, and 2'-0- methyl nucleotides. Locked nucleic acids, or LNA's are described, for example, in Elman et al, 2005; Kurreck et al, 2002; Crinelli et al, 2002; Braasch and Corey, 2001; Bondensgaard et al, 2000; Wahlestedt et al, 2000; and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 00/47599, WO 99/14226, and WO 98/39352 and WO 2004/083430. In one embodiment, an LNA is incorporated at the 5 ' terminus of the sense strand. \n\n\n[0226] Chemical modifications also include unlocked nucleic acids, or UNAs, which are non-nucleotide, acyclic analogues, in which the C2'-C3' bond is not present (although UNAs are not truly nucleotides, they are expressly included in the scope of \"modified\" nucleotides or modified nucleic acids as contemplated herein). In particular embodiments, nucleic acid molecules with an overhang may be modified to have UNAs at the overhang positions (i.e., 2 nucleotide overhand). In other embodiments, UNAs are included at the 3'- or 5'- ends. A \n\n UNA may be located anywhere along a nucleic acid strand, i.e. in position 7. Nucleic acid molecules may contain one or more than UNA. Exemplary UNAs are disclosed in Nucleic Acids Symposium Series No. 52 p. 133-134 (2008). In certain embodiments a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a siNA molecule) as described herein include one or more UNAs; or one UNA. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a siNA molecule) as described herein that has a 3 '-overhang include one or two UNAs in the 3' overhang. In some embodiments a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a siNA molecule) as described herein includes a UNA (for example one UNA) in the antisense strand; for example in position 6 or position 7 of the antisense strand.

A nucleotide linker can be a linker of > 2 nucleotides in length, for example about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides in length. The nucleotide linker can be a nucleic acid aptamer. By \"aptamer\" or \"nucleic acid aptamer\" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule that binds specifically to a target molecule wherein the nucleic acid molecule has sequence that includes a sequence recognized by the target molecule in its natural setting. Alternately, an aptamer can be a nucleic acid molecule that binds to a target molecule (such as hsp47 mRNA) where the target molecule does not naturally bind to a nucleic acid. For example, the aptamer can be used to bind to a ligand-binding domain of a protein, thereby preventing interaction of the naturally occurring ligand with the protein. This is a non-limiting example and those in the art will recognize that other embodiments can be readily generated using techniques generally known in the art. See e.g., Gold et al; 1995, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 64, 763; Brody and Gold, 2000, J. BiotechnoL, 74, 5; Sun, 2000, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther., 2, 100; Kusser, 2000, J.

A pattern of modification of the nucleotides in a contiguous stretch of nucleotides may be a modification contained within a single nucleotide or group of nucleotides that are covalently linked to each other via standard phosphodiester bonds or, at least partially, through phosphorothioate bonds. Accordingly, a \"pattern\" as contemplated herein, does not necessarily need to involve repeating units, although it may. Examples of modification patterns that may be used in conjunction with the nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) provided herein include those disclosed in Giese, US Patent No. 7,452,987. For example, nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) provided herein include those having modification patters such as, similar to, or the same as, the patterns shown diagrammatically in figure 2 of the Giese US Patent No. 7,452,987. \n\n\n[0262] A modified nucleotide or group of modified nucleotides may be at the 5 '-end or 3 '-end of the sense or antisense strand, a flanking nucleotide or group of nucleotides is arrayed on both sides of the modified nucleotide or group, where the flanking nucleotide or group either is unmodified or does not have the same modification of the preceding nucleotide or group of nucleotides. The flanking nucleotide or group of nucleotides may, however, have a different modification. This sequence of modified nucleotide or group of modified nucleotides, respectively, and unmodified or differently modified nucleotide or group of unmodified or differently modified nucleotides may be repeated one or more times. \n\n\n[0263] In some patterns, the 5 '-terminal nucleotide of a strand is a modified nucleotide while in other patterns the 5 '-terminal nucleotide of a strand is an unmodified nucleotide. In some patterns, the 5'- end of a strand starts with a group of modified nucleotides while in other patterns, the 5 '-terminal end is an unmodified group of nucleotides. This pattern may be either on the first stretch or the second stretch of the nucleic acid molecule or on both. \n\n [0264] Modified nucleotides of one strand of the nucleic acid molecule may be complementary in position to the modified or unmodified nucleotides or groups of nucleotides of the other strand. \n\n\n[0265] There may be a phase shift between modifications or patterns of modifications on one strand relative to the pattern of modification of the other strand such that the modification groups do not overlap. In one instance, the shift is such that the modified group of nucleotides of the sense strand corresponds to the unmodified group of nucleotides of the antisense strand and vice versa. \n\n\n[0266] There may be a partial shift of the pattern of modification such that the modified groups overlap. The groups of modified nucleotides in any given strand may optionally be the same length, but may be of different lengths. Similarly, groups of unmodified nucleotides in any given strand may optionally be the same length, or of different lengths. \n\n\n[0267] In some patterns, the second (penultimate) nucleotide at the terminus of the strand, is an unmodified nucleotide or the beginning of group of unmodified nucleotides. Preferably, this unmodified nucleotide or unmodified group of nucleotides is located at the 5 '-end of the either or both the sense and antisense strands and even more preferably at the terminus of the sense strand. An unmodified nucleotide or unmodified group of nucleotide may be located at the 5 '-end of the sense strand. In a preferred embodiment the pattern consists of alternating single modified and unmodified nucleotides. \n\n\n[0268] In some double stranded nucleic acid molecules include a 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotide and a non-modified nucleotide, preferably a nucleotide which is not 2'-0-methyl modified, are incorporated on both strands in an alternating fashion, resulting in a pattern of alternating 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotides and nucleotides that are either unmodified or at least do not include a 2'-0-methyl modification. In certain embodiments, the same sequence of 2'-0-methyl modification and non-modification exists on the second strand; in other embodiments the alternating 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotides are only present in the sense strand and are not present in the antisense strand; and in yet other embodiments the alternating 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotides are only present in the sense strand and are not present in the antisense strand. In certain embodiments, there is a phase shift between the two strands such that the 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotide on the first strand base pairs with a non- modified nucleotide(s) on the second strand and vice versa. This particular arrangement, i.e. \n\n base pairing of 2'-0-methyl modified and non-modified nucleotide(s) on both strands is particularly preferred in certain embodiments. In certain embodiments, the pattern of alternating 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotides exists throughout the entire nucleic acid molecule; or the entire duplex region. In other embodiments the pattern of alternating 2'-0- methyl modified nucleotides exists only in a portion of the nucleic acid; or the entire duplex region. \n\n\n[0269] In \"phase shift\" patterns, it may be preferred if the antisense strand starts with a 2'- O-methyl modified nucleotide at the 5 ' end whereby consequently the second nucleotide is non-modified, the third, fifth, seventh and so on nucleotides are thus again 2'-0-methyl modified whereas the second, fourth, sixth, eighth and the like nucleotides are non-modified nucleotides. \n\n\nExemplary Modification Locations and Patterns \n\n\n[0270] While exemplary patterns are provided in more detail below, all permutations of patterns with of all possible characteristics of the nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and those known in the art are contemplated (e.g., characteristics include, but are not limited to, length of sense strand, length of antisense strand, length of duplex region, length of hangover, whether one or both ends of a double stranded nucleic acid molecule is blunt or has an overhang, location of modified nucleic acid, number of modified nucleic acids, types of modifications, whether a double overhang nucleic acid molecule has the same or different number of nucleotides on the overhang of each side, whether a one or more than one type of modification is used in a nucleic acid molecule, and number of contiguous \n\n\nmodified/unmodified nucleotides). With respect to all detailed examples provided below, while the duplex region is shown to be 19 nucleotides, the nucleic acid molecules provided herein can have a duplex region ranging from 1 to 49 nucleotides in length as each strand of a duplex region can independently be 17-49 nucleotides in length Exemplary patterns are provided herein. \n\n\n[0271] Nucleic acid molecules may have a blunt end (when n is 0) on both ends that include a single or contiguous set of modified nucleic acids. The modified nucleic acid may be located at any position along either the sense or antisense strand. Nucleic acid molecules may include a group of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, \n\n46, 47, 48 or 49 contiguous modified nucleotides. Modified nucleic acids may make up 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98% or 100% of a nucleic acid strand. Modified nucleic acids of the examples immediately below may be in the sense strand only, the antisense strand only, or in both the sense and antisense strand. \n\n\n[0272] General nucleic acid patters are shown below where X = sense strand nucleotide in the duplex region; X\na\n = 5 '-overhang nucleotide in the sense strand; Xb = 3 '-overhang nucleotide in the sense strand; Y = antisense strand nucleotide in the duplex region; Y\na\n = 3'- overhang nucleotide in the antisense strand; Y\nb\n = 5 '-overhang nucleotide in the antisense strand; and M = a modified nucleotide in the duplex region. Each a and b are independently 0 to 8 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8). Each X, Y, a and b are independently modified or unmodified. The sense and antisense strands can are each independently 17-49 nucleotides in length. The examples provided below have a duplex region of 19 nucleotides; however, nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein can have a duplex region anywhere between 17 and 49 nucleotides and where each strand is independently between 17 and 49 nucleotides in length. \n\n\n5' XaXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXb \n\n\n 3' Y\nb\nYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\na\n \n\n\n[0273] Further exemplary nucleic acid molecule patterns are shown below where X = unmodified sense strand nucleotides; x = an unmodified overhang nucleotide in the sense strand; Y = unmodified antisense strand nucleotides; y = an unmodified overhang nucleotide in the antisense strand; and M = a modified nucleotide.

strand, preferably the sense strand, that is nicked or gapped. As such, nucleic acid molecules may have three or more strand, for example, such as a meroduplex RNA (mdRNA) disclosed in International Patent Application No. PCT/US07/081836. Nucleic acid molecules with a nicked or gapped strand may be between about 1-49 nucleotides, or may be RISC length (e.g., about 15 to 25 nucleotides) or Dicer substrate length (e.g., about 25 to 30 nucleotides) such as disclosed herein. \n\n\n[0299] Nucleic acid molecules with three or more strands include, for example, an 'A' (antisense) strand, 'SI ' (second) strand, and 'S2' (third) strand in which the 'SI ' and 'S2' strands are complementary to and form base pairs with non-overlapping regions of the 'A' strand (e.g., an mdRNA can have the form of A:S1S2). The SI, S2, or more strands together form what is substantially similar to a sense strand to the 'A' antisense strand. The double- stranded region formed by the annealing of the 'SI ' and 'A' strands is distinct from and non- overlapping with the double-stranded region formed by the annealing of the 'S2' and 'A' strands. An nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an siNA molecule) may be a \"gapped\" molecule, meaning a \"gap\" ranging from 0 nucleotides up to about 10 nucleotides (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 nucleotides). Preferably, the sense strand is gapped. In some embodiments, the A: SI duplex is separated from the A:S2 duplex by a gap resulting from at least one unpaired nucleotide (up to about 10 unpaired nucleotides) in the 'A' strand that is positioned between \n\n the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplex and that is distinct from any one or more unpaired nucleotide at the 3 '-end of one or more of the Ά', 'SI ', or 'S2 strands. The A: SI duplex may be separated from the A:B2 duplex by a gap of zero nucleotides (i.e., a nick in which only a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides is broken or missing in the polynucleotide molecule) between the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplex -which can also be referred to as nicked dsRNA (ndsRNA). For example, A:S1S2 may be include a dsRNA having at least two double-stranded regions that combined total about 14 base pairs to about 40 base pairs and the double-stranded regions are separated by a gap of about 0 to about 10 nucleotides, optionally having blunt ends, or A:S1S2 may include a dsRNA having at least two double-stranded regions separated by a gap of up to 10 nucleotides wherein at least one of the double-stranded regions includes between about 5 base pairs and 13 base pairs. \n\n\nDicer Substrates \n\n\n[0300] In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) provided herein may be a precursor \"Dicer substrate\" molecule, e.g., double stranded nucleic acid, processed in vivo to produce an active nucleic acid molecules, for example as described in Rossi, US Patent App. No. 20050244858. In certain conditions and situations, it has been found that these relatively longer dsRNA siNA species, e.g., of from about 25 to about 30 nucleotides, can give unexpectedly effective results in terms of potency and duration of action. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought that the longer dsRNA species serve as a substrate for the enzyme Dicer in the cytoplasm of a cell. In addition to cleaving double stranded nucleic acid into shorter segments, Dicer may facilitate the incorporation of a single-stranded cleavage product derived from the cleaved dsRNA into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC complex) that is responsible for the destruction of the cytoplasmic RNA derived from the target gene. \n\n\n[0301] Dicer substrates may have certain properties which enhance its processing by Dicer. Dicer substrates are of a length sufficient such that it is processed by Dicer to produce an active nucleic acid molecule and may further include one or more of the following properties: (i) the dsRNA is asymmetric, e.g., has a 3' overhang on the first strand (antisense strand) and (ii) the dsRNA has a modified 3' end on the antisense strand (sense strand) to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing of the dsRNA to an active siRNA. In certain embodiments, the longest strand in the Dicer substrate may be 24-30 nucleotides. \n\n [0302] Dicer substrates may be symmetric or asymmetric. The Dicer substrate may have a sense strand includes 22-28 nucleotides and the antisense strand may include 24-30 nucleotides; thus, in some embodiments the resulting Dicer substrate may have an overhang on the 3' end of the antisense strand. Dicer substrate may have a sense strand 25 nucleotides in length, and the antisense strand having 27 nucleotides in length with a 2 base 3 '-overhang. The overhang may be 1-3 nucleotides, for example 2 nucleotides. The sense strand may also have a 5' phosphate. \n\n\n[0303] An asymmetric Dicer substrate may further contain two deoxynucleotides at the 3 '-end of the sense strand in place of two of the ribonucleotides. Some exemplary Dicer substrates lengths and structures are 21+0, 21+2, 21-2, 22+0, 22+1, 22-1, 23+0, 23+2, 23-2, 24+0, 24+2, 24-2, 25+0, 25+2, 25-2, 26+0, 26+2, 26-2, 27+0, 27+2, and 27-2. \n\n\n[0304] The sense strand of a Dicer substrate may be between about 22 to about 30 (e.g., about 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30); about 22 to about 28; about 24 to about 30; about 25 to about 30; about 26 to about 30; about 26 and 29; or about 27 to about 28 nucleotides in length. In certain preferred embodiments Dicer substrates contain sense and antisense strands, that are at least about 25 nucleotides in length and no longer than about 30 nucleotides; \n\n\nbetween about 26 and 29 nucleotides; or 27 nucleotides in length. The sense and antisense strands may be the same length (blunt ended), different lengths (have overhangs), or a combination. The sense and antisense strands may exist on the same polynucleotide or on different polynucleotides. A Dicer substrate may have a duplex region of about 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or 27 nucleotides. \n\n\n[0305] Like other siNA molecules provided herein, the antisense strand of a Dicer substrate may have any sequence that anneals to the antisense strand under biological conditions, such as within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. \n\n\n[0306] Dicer substrates may have any modifications to the nucleotide base, sugar or phosphate backbone as known in the art and/or as described herein for other nucleic acid molecules (such as siNA molecules). In certain embodiments, Dicer substrates may have a sense strand is modified for Dicer processing by suitable modifiers located at the 3 ' end of the sense strand, i.e., the dsRNA is designed to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing. Suitable modifiers include nucleotides such as deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, acyclonucleotides and the like and sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent \n\n molecules and the like. Acyclonucleotides substitute a 2-hydroxyethoxymethyl group for-the 2'-deoxyribofuranosyl sugar normally present in dNMPs. Other nucleotides modifiers that could be used in Dicer substrate siNA molecules include 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3'- azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3 '-dideoxyinosine (ddl), 2',3 '-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC), 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidi- ne (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2',3'-didehydro- 2',3'-dide-oxythymidine (d4T). In one embodiment, deoxynucleotides are used as the modifiers. When nucleotide modifiers are utilized, they may replace ribonucleotides (e.g., 1-3 nucleotide modifiers, or 2 nucleotide modifiers are substituted for the ribonucleotides on the 3' end of the sense strand) such that the length of the Dicer substrate does not change. When sterically hindered molecules are utilized, they may be attached to the ribonucleotide at the 3 ' end of the antisense strand. Thus, in certain embodiments the length of the strand does not change with the incorporation of the modifiers. In certain embodiments, two DNA bases in the dsRNA are substituted to direct the orientation of Dicer processing of the antisense strand. In a further embodiment of, two terminal DNA bases are substituted for two ribonucleotides on the 3 '-end of the sense strand forming a blunt end of the duplex on the 3' end of the sense strand and the 5 ' end of the antisense strand, and a two-nucleotide RNA overhang is located on the 3 '-end of the antisense strand. This is an asymmetric composition with DNA on the blunt end and RNA bases on the overhanging end. \n\n\n[0307] In certain embodiments modifications are included in the Dicer substrate such that the modification does not prevent the nucleic acid molecule from serving as a substrate for Dicer. In one embodiment, one or more modifications are made that enhance Dicer processing of the Dicer substrate. One or more modifications may be made that result in more effective RNAi generation. One or more modifications may be made that support a greater RNAi effect. One or more modifications are made that result in greater potency per each Dicer substrate to be delivered to the cell. Modifications may be incorporated in the 3 '-terminal region, the 5 '-terminal region, in both the 3 '-terminal and 5 '-terminal region or at various positions within the sequence. Any number and combination of modifications can be incorporated into the Dicer substrate so long as the modification does not prevent the nucleic acid molecule from serving as a substrate for Dicer. Where multiple modifications are present, they may be the same or different. Modifications to bases, sugar moieties, the phosphate backbone, and their combinations are contemplated. Either 5 '-terminus can be phosphorylated. \n\n [0308] Examples of Dicer substrate phosphate backbone modifications include \n\n\nphosphonates, including methylphosphonate, phosphorothioate, and phosphotriester modifications such as alkylphosphotriesters, and the like. Examples of Dicer substrate sugar moiety modifications include 2'-alkyl pyrimidine, such as 2'-0-methyl, 2'-fluoro, amino, and deoxy modifications and the like (see, e.g., Amarzguioui et al, 2003). Examples of Dicer substrate base group modifications include abasic sugars, 2-O-alkyl modified pyrimidines, 4- thiouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-iodouracil, and 5-(3-aminoallyl)-uracil and the like. Locked nucleic acids, or LNA's, could also be incorporated. \n\n\n[0309] The sense strand may be modified for Dicer processing by suitable modifiers located at the 3' end of the sense strand, i.e., the Dicer substrate is designed to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing. Suitable modifiers include nucleotides such as deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, acyclonucleotides and the like and sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Acyclonucleotides substitute a 2-hydroxyethoxymethyl group for-the 2'-deoxyribofuranosyl sugar normally present in dNMPs. Other nucleotides modifiers could include 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3'- azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3 '-dideoxyinosine (ddl), 2',3 '-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC), 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidi- ne (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2',3'-didehydro- 2',3'-dide-oxythymidine (d4T). In one embodiment, deoxynucleotides are used as the modifiers. When nucleotide modifiers are utilized, 1-3 nucleotide modifiers, or 2 nucleotide modifiers are substituted for the ribonucleotides on the 3 ' end of the sense strand. When sterically hindered molecules are utilized, they are attached to the ribonucleotide at the 3 ' end of the antisense strand. Thus, the length of the strand does not change with the incorporation of the modifiers. In another embodiment, the invention contemplates substituting two DNA bases in the Dicer substrate to direct the orientation of Dicer processing of the antisense strand. In a further embodiment of the present invention, two terminal DNA bases are substituted for two ribonucleotides on the 3 '-end of the sense strand forming a blunt end of the duplex on the 3' end of the sense strand and the 5' end of the antisense strand, and a two- nucleotide RNA overhang is located on the 3 '-end of the antisense strand. This is an asymmetric composition with DNA on the blunt end and RNA bases on the overhanging end. \n\n\n[0310] The antisense strand may be modified for Dicer processing by suitable modifiers located at the 3' end of the antisense strand, i.e., the dsRNA is designed to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing. Suitable modifiers include nucleotides such as \n\n deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, acyclonucleotides and the like and sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Acyclonucleotides substitute a 2-hydroxyethoxymethyl group for the 2'-deoxyribofuranosyl sugar normally present in dNMPs. Other nucleotide modifiers could include 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3'-azido- 3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC), 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidi- ne (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3'- azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2',3 '-didehydro- 2',3'-dide- oxythymidine (d4T). In one embodiment, deoxynucleotides are used as the modifiers. When nucleotide modifiers are utilized, 1-3 nucleotide modifiers, or 2 nucleotide modifiers are substituted for the ribonucleotides on the 3 ' end of the antisense strand. When sterically hindered molecules are utilized, they are attached to the ribonucleotide at the 3 ' end of the antisense strand. Thus, the length of the strand does not change with the incorporation of the modifiers. In another embodiment, the invention contemplates substituting two DNA bases in the dsRNA to direct the orientation of Dicer processing. In a further invention, two terminal DNA bases are located on the 3 ' end of the antisense strand in place of two ribonucleotides forming a blunt end of the duplex on the 5 ' end of the sense strand and the 3 ' end of the antisense strand, and a two-nucleotide RNA overhang is located on the 3 '-end of the sense strand. This is an asymmetric composition with DNA on the blunt end and RNA bases on the overhanging end. \n\n\n[0311] Dicer substrates with a sense and an antisense strand can be linked by a third structure. The third structure will not block Dicer activity on the Dicer substrate and will not interfere with the directed destruction of the RNA transcribed from the target gene. The third structure may be a chemical linking group. Suitable chemical linking groups are known in the art and can be used. Alternatively, the third structure may be an oligonucleotide that links the two oligonucleotides of the dsRNA is a manner such that a hairpin structure is produced upon annealing of the two oligonucleotides making up the Dicer substrate. The hairpin structure preferably does not block Dicer activity on the Dicer substrate or interfere with the directed destruction of the RNA transcribed from the target gene. \n\n\n[0312] The sense and antisense strands of the Dicer substrate are not required to be completely complementary. They only need to be substantially complementary to anneal under biological conditions and to provide a substrate for Dicer that produces an siRNA sufficiently complementary to the target sequence. \n\n [0313] Dicer substrate can have certain properties that enhance its processing by Dicer. The Dicer substrate can have a length sufficient such that it is processed by Dicer to produce an active nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siR A) and may have one or more of the following properties: (i) the Dicer substrate is asymmetric, e.g., has a 3' overhang on the first strand (antisense strand) and (ii) the Dicer substrate has a modified 3' end on the second strand (sense strand) to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing of the Dicer substrate to an active siRNA. The Dicer substrate can be asymmetric such that the sense strand includes 22- 28 nucleotides and the antisense strand includes 24-30 nucleotides. Thus, the resulting Dicer substrate has an overhang on the 3' end of the antisense strand. The overhang is 1-3 nucleotides, for example 2 nucleotides. The sense strand may also have a 5' phosphate. \n\n\n[0314] A Dicer substrate may have an overhang on the 3' end of the antisense strand and the sense strand is modified for Dicer processing. The 5' end of the sense strand may have a phosphate. The sense and antisense strands may anneal under biological conditions, such as the conditions found in the cytoplasm of a cell. A region of one of the strands, particularly the antisense strand, of the Dicer substrate may have a sequence length of at least 19 nucleotides, wherein these nucleotides are in the 21 -nucleotide region adjacent to the 3' end of the antisense strand and are sufficiently complementary to a nucleotide sequence of the RNA produced from the target gene. A Dicer substrate may also have one or more of the following additional properties: (a) the antisense strand has a right shift from a corresponding 21-mer (i.e., the antisense strand includes nucleotides on the right side of the molecule when compared to the corresponding 21-mer), (b) the strands may not be completely \n\n\ncomplementary, i.e., the strands may contain simple mismatch pairings and (c) base modifications such as locked nucleic acid(s) may be included in the 5 ' end of the sense strand. \n\n\n[0315] An antisense strand of a Dicer substrate nucleic acid molecule may be modified to include 1-9 ribonucleotides on the 5' -end to give a length of 22-28 nucleotides. When the antisense strand has a length of 21 nucleotides, then 1-7 ribonucleotides, or 2-5 \n\n\nribonucleotides and or 4 ribonucleotides may be added on the 3 '-end. The added \n\n\nribonucleotides may have any sequence. Although the added ribonucleotides may be complementary to the target gene sequence, full complementarity between the target sequence and the antisense strands is not required. That is, the resultant antisense strand is sufficiently complementary with the target sequence. A sense strand may then have 24-30 nucleotides. The sense strand may be substantially complementary with the antisense strand to anneal to the antisense strand under biological conditions. In one embodiment, the antisense strand may \n\n be synthesized to contain a modified 3' -end to direct Dicer processing. The sense strand may have a 3' overhang. The antisense strand may be synthesized to contain a modified 3' -end for Dicer binding and processing and the sense strand has a 3' overhang. \n\n\nHeat Shock Protein 47 \n\n\n[0316] Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) is a collagen-specific molecular chaperone and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. It interacts with procollagen during the process of folding, assembling and transporting from the endoplasmic reticulum (Nagata Trends Biochem Sci 1996; 21 :22-6; Razzaque et al. 2005; Contrib Nephrol 2005; 148: 57-69; Koide et al. 2006 J. Biol. Chem.; 281 : 3432-38; Leivo et al. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 100-114; Masuda et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94:2481-2488; Masuda et al. Cell Stress Chaperones 1998; 3:256- 264). HSP47 has been reported to have an upregulated expression in various tissue fibrosis (Koide et al. J Biol Chem 1999; 274: 34523-26), such as liver cirrhosis (Masuda et al. J Clin Invest 1994; 94:2481-8), pulmonary fibrosis (Razzaque et al. Virchows Arch 1998; 432:455- 60; Kakugawa et al. Eur Respir J 2004; 24: 57-65), and glomerulosclerosis (Moriyama et al. Kidney Int 1998; 54: 110-19). Exemplary nucleic acid sequence of target human hsp47 cDNA is disclosed in GenBank accession number: NM 001235 and the corresponding mRNA sequence, for example as listed as SEQ ID NO: 1. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that a given sequence may change over time and to incorporate any changes needed in the nucleic acid molecules herein accordingly. \n\n\n[0317] The specific association of HSP47 with a diverse range of collagen types makes HSP47 a potential target for the treatment of fibrosis. Inhibition of hsp47 expression may prevent extracellular collagen I secretion. Sato et al. (Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:431-442) explored this possibility by using siRNA for the inhibition hsp47 expression and preventing the progression of hepatic fibrosis in rats. Similarly, Chen et al. (Br J Dermatol 2007; 156: 1188-1195) and Wang et al. (Plast. Reconstr Surg 2003; 111 : 1980-7) investigated the inhibition hsp47 expression by RNA interference technology. \n\n\n[0318] Methods and Compositions for Inhibiting hsp47 \n\n\n[0319] Provided are compositions and methods for inhibition of hsp47 expression by using small nucleic acid molecules, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), interfering RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules capable of mediating or that mediate \n\n R A interference against hsp47 gene expression. The composition and methods disclosed herein are also useful in treating various fibrosis such as liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, and kidney fibrosis. \n\n\n[0320] Nucleic acid molecule(s) and/or methods of the invention are used to down regulate the expression of gene(s) that encode RNA referred to, by example, Genbank Accession NM_001235. \n\n\n[0321] Compositions, methods and kits provided herein may include one or more nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA) and methods that independently or in combination modulate (e.g., downregulate) the expression of hsp47 protein and/or genes encoding hsp47 proteins, proteins and/or genes encoding hsp47 associated with the maintenance and/or development of diseases, conditions or disorders associated with hsp47, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, chronic hepatic damage, and fibrillogenesis (e.g., genes encoding sequences comprising those sequences referred to by GenBank Accession Nos. NM_001235), or a hsp47 gene family member where the genes or gene family sequences share sequence homology. The description of the various aspects and embodiments is provided with reference to exemplary gene hsp47. However, the various aspects and embodiments are also directed to other related hsp47 genes, such as homolog genes and transcript variants, and polymorphisms (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism, (SNPs)) associated with certain hsp47 genes. As such, the various aspects and embodiments are also directed to other genes that are involved in hsp47 mediated pathways of signal transduction or gene expression that are involved, for example, in the maintenance or development of diseases, traits, or conditions described herein. These additional genes can be analyzed for target sites using the methods described for the hsp47 gene herein. Thus, the modulation of other genes and the effects of such modulation of the other genes can be performed, determined, and measured as described herein. \n\n\n[0322] In one embodiment, compositions and methods provided herein include a double- stranded short interfering nucleic acid (siNA) molecule that down-regulates expression of a hsp47 gene (e.g., human hsp47 exemplified by SEQ ID NO: l), where the nucleic acid molecule includes about 15 to about 49 base pairs. \n\n\n[0323] In one embodiment, a nucleic acid disclosed may be used to inhibit the expression of the hsp47 gene or a hsp47 gene family where the genes or gene family sequences share \n\n sequence homology. Such homologous sequences can be identified as is known in the art, for example using sequence alignments. Nucleic acid molecules can be designed to target such homologous sequences, for example using perfectly complementary sequences or by incorporating non-canonical base pairs, for example mismatches and/or wobble base pairs, that can provide additional target sequences. In instances where mismatches are identified, non-canonical base pairs (for example, mismatches and/or wobble bases) can be used to generate nucleic acid molecules that target more than one gene sequence. In a non-limiting example, non-canonical base pairs such as UU and CC base pairs are used to generate nucleic acid molecules that are capable of targeting sequences for differing hsp47 targets that share sequence homology. As such, one advantage of using siNAs disclosed herein is that a single nucleic acid can be designed to include nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to the nucleotide sequence that is conserved between the homologous genes. In this approach, a single nucleic acid can be used to inhibit expression of more than one gene instead of using more than one nucleic acid molecule to target the different genes. \n\n\n[0324] Nucleic acid molecules may be used to target conserved sequences corresponding to a gene family or gene families such as hsp47 family genes. As such, nucleic acid molecules targeting multiple hsp47 targets can provide increased therapeutic effect. In addition, nucleic acid can be used to characterize pathways of gene function in a variety of applications. For example, nucleic acid molecules can be used to inhibit the activity of target gene(s) in a pathway to determine the function of uncharacterized gene(s) in gene function analysis, mRNA function analysis, or translational analysis. The nucleic acid molecules can be used to determine potential target gene pathways involved in various diseases and conditions toward pharmaceutical development. The nucleic acid molecules can be used to understand pathways of gene expression involved in, for example fibroses such as liver, kidney or pulmonary fibrosis, and/or inflammatory and proliferative traits, diseases, disorders, and/or conditions. \n\n\n[0325] In one embodiment, the compositions and methods provided herein include a nucleic acid molecule having RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to any RNA having hsp47 encoding sequence, such as those sequences having sequences as shown in Table I. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule may have RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to an RNA having variant hsp47 encoding sequence, for example other mutant hsp47 genes not shown in Table I but known in the art to \n\n be associated with the maintenance and/or development of fibrosis. Chemical modifications as shown in Table I or otherwise described herein can be applied to any nucleic acid construct disclosed herein. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein includes a nucleotide sequence that can interact with nucleotide sequence of a hsp47 gene and thereby mediate silencing of hsp47 gene expression, for example, wherein the nucleic acid molecule mediates regulation of hsp47 gene expression by cellular processes that modulate the chromatin structure or methylation patterns of the hsp47 gene and prevent transcription of the hsp47 gene. \n\n\n[0326] Nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein may have RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to any RNA having hsp47 encoding sequence, such as those sequences having GenBank Accession Nos. NM_001235. Nucleic acid molecules may have RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to an RNA having variant hsp47 encoding sequence, for example other mutant hsp47 genes known in the art to be associated with the maintenance and/or development of fibrosis. Nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein include a nucleotide sequence that can interact with nucleotide sequence of a hsp47 gene and thereby mediate silencing of hsp47 gene expression, e.g., where the nucleic acid molecule mediates regulation of hsp47 gene expression by cellular processes that modulate the chromatin structure or methylation patterns of the hsp47 gene and prevent transcription of the hsp47 gene. \n\n\nMethods of Treatment \n\n\n[0327] The specific association of HSP47 with a diverse range of collagen types makes hsp47 a target for the treatment of fibrosis. Inhibition of hsp47 expression may prevent extracellular collagen I secretion. Sato et al. (Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:431-442) explored this possibility by using siRNA for the inhibition hsp47 expression and preventing the progression of hepatic fibrosis in rats. Similarly, Chen et al. (Br J Dermatol 2007; 156: 1188-1195) and Wang et al. (Plast. Reconstr Surg 2003; 111 : 1980-7) investigated the inhibition hsp47 expression by RNA interference technology. \n\n\n[0328] In one embodiment, nucleic acid molecules may be used to down regulate or inhibit the expression of hsp47 and/or hsp47 proteins arising from hsp47 and/or hsp47 haplotype polymorphisms that are associated with a disease or condition, (e.g., fibrosis). \n\n Analysis of hsp47 and/or hsp47 genes, or hsp47 and/or hsp47 protein or RNA levels can be used to identify subjects with such polymorphisms or those subjects who are at risk of developing traits, conditions, or diseases described herein. These subjects are amenable to treatment, for example, treatment with nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and any other composition useful in treating diseases related to hsp47 and/or hsp47 gene expression. As such, analysis of hsp47 and/or hsp47 protein or RNA levels can be used to determine treatment type and the course of therapy in treating a subject. Monitoring of hsp47 and/or hsp47 protein or RNA levels can be used to predict treatment outcome and to determine the efficacy of compounds and compositions that modulate the level and/or activity of certain hsp47 and/or hsp47 proteins associated with a trait, condition, or disease. \n\n\n[0329] Provided are compositions and methods for inhibition of hsp47 expression by using small nucleic acid molecules as provided herein, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), interfering RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules capable of mediating or that mediate RNA interference against hsp47 gene expression. The composition and methods disclosed herein are also useful in treating various fibrosis such as liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, and kidney fibrosis. \n\n\n[0330] The nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein individually, or in combination or in conjunction with other drugs, can be use for preventing or treating diseases, traits, conditions and/or disorders associated with hsp47, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, chronic hepatic damage, and fibrillogenesis. \n\n\n[0331] The nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein are able to inhibit the expression of hsp47 in a sequence specific manner. The nucleic acid molecules may include a sense strand and an antisense strand which include contiguous nucleotides that are at least partially complementary (antisense) to a hsp47 mRNA. \n\n\n[0332] In some embodiments, dsRNA specific for hsp47 can be used in conjunction with other dsRNA specific for other molecular chaperones that assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins such as, calnexin, calreticulin, BiP (Bergeron et al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128; Herbert et al. 1995; Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 60:405-415) \n\n\n[0333] Fibrosis can be treated by RNA interference using nucleic acid molecules as disclosed herein. Exemplary fibrosis include liver fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, lung fibrosis, \n\n kidney fibrosis. The nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein may inhibit the expression of hsp47 in a sequence specific manner. \n\n\n[0334] Treatment of fibrosis can be monitored by determining the level of extracellular collagen using suitable techniques known in the art such as, using anti-collagen I antibodies. Treatment can also be monitored by determining the level of hsp47 mR A or the level of HSP47 protein in the cells of the affected tissue. Treatment can also be monitored by noninvasive scanning of the affected organ or tissue such as by computer assisted tomography scan, magnetic resonance elastography scans. \n\n\n[0335] A method for treating or preventing hsp47 associated disease or condition in a subject or organism may include contacting the subject or organism with a nucleic acid molecule as provided herein under conditions suitable to modulate the expression of the hsp47 gene in the subject or organism. \n\n\n[0336] A method for treating or preventing fibrosis in a subject or organism may include contacting the subject or organism with a nucleic acid molecule under conditions suitable to modulate the expression of the hsp47 gene in the subject or organism. \n\n\n[0337] A method for treating or preventing one or more fibroses selected from the group consisting of liver fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis in a subject or organism may include contacting the subject or organism with a nucleic acid molecule under conditions suitable to modulate the expression of the hsp47 gene in the subject or organism. \n\n\nFibrotic Diseases \n\n\n[0338] Fibrotic diseases are generally characterized by the excess deposition of a fibrous material within the extracellular matrix, which contributes to abnormal changes in tissue architecture and interferes with normal organ function. \n\n\n[0339] All tissues damaged by trauma respond by the initiation of a wound-healing program. Fibrosis, a type of disorder characterized by excessive scarring, occurs when the normal self-limiting process of wound healing response is disturbed, and causes excessive production and deposition of collagen. As a result, normal organ tissue is replaced with scar tissue, which eventually leads to the functional failure of the organ. \n\n [0340] Fibrosis may be initiated by diverse causes and in various organs. Liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, keloids and kidney fibrosis are all chronic conditions associated with progressive fibrosis, thereby causing a continuous loss of normal tissue function. \n\n\n[0341] Acute fibrosis (usually with a sudden and severe onset and of short duration) occurs as a common response to various forms of trauma including accidental injuries (particularly injuries to the spine and central nervous system), infections, surgery, ischemic illness (e.g. cardiac scarring following heart attack), burns, environmental pollutants, alcohol and other types of toxins, acute respiratory distress syndrome, radiation and chemotherapy treatments). \n\n\n[0342] Fibrosis, a fibrosis related pathology or a pathology related to aberrant crosslinking of cellular proteins may all be treated by the siR As disclosed herein. Fibrotic diseases or diseases in which fibrosis is evident (fibrosis related pathology) include both acute and chronic forms of fibrosis of organs, including all etiological variants of the following: \n\n\npulmonary fibrosis, including interstitial lung disease and fibrotic lung disease, liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis including myocardial fibrosis, kidney fibrosis including chronic renal failure, skin fibrosis including scleroderma, keloids and hypertrophic scars; myelofibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis); all types of ocular scarring including proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and scarring resulting from surgery to treat cataract or glaucoma; inflammatory bowel disease of variable etiology, macular degeneration, Grave's ophthalmopathy, drug induced ergotism, keloid scars, scleroderma, psoriasis, glioblastoma in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, sporadic glioblastoma, myleoid leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplasia syndrome, myeloproferative syndrome, gynecological cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, Hansen's disease, and collagenous colitis . \n\n\n[0343] In various embodiments, the compounds (nucleic acid molecules) as disclosed herein may be used to treat fibrotic diseases, for example as disclosed herein, as well as many other diseases and conditions apart from fibrotic diseases, for example such as disclosed herein. Other conditions to be treated include fibrotic diseases in other organs - kidney fibrosis for any reason (CKD including ESRD); lung fibrosis (including ILF); myelofibrosis, abnormal scarring (keloids) associated with all possible types of skin injury accidental and jatrogenic (operations); scleroderma; cardio fibrosis, failure of glaucoma filtering operation; intestinal adhesions. \n\n Ocular surgery and fibrotic complications \n\n\n[0344] Contracture of scar tissue resulting from eye surgery may often occur. Glaucoma surgery to create new drainage channels often fails due to scarring and contraction of tissues and the generated drainage system may be blocked requiring additional surgical intervention. Current anti-scarring regimens (Mitomycin C or 5FU) are limited due to the complications involved (e.g. blindness) e.g. see Cordeiro MF, et al., Human anti-transforming growth factor- beta2 antibody: a new glaucoma anti-scarring agent Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1999 \n\n\nSep;40(10):2225-34. There may also be contraction of scar tissue formed after corneal trauma or corneal surgery, for example laser or surgical treatment for myopia or refractive error in which contraction of tissues may lead to inaccurate results. Scar tissue may be formed on/in the vitreous humor or the retina, for example, and may eventually causes blindness in some diabetics, and may be formed after detachment surgery, called proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is the most common complication following retinal detachment and is associated with a retinal hole or break. PVR refers to the growth of cellular membranes within the vitreous cavity and on the front and back surfaces of the retina containing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. These membranes, which are essentially scar tissues, exert traction on the retina and may result in recurrences of retinal detachment, even after an initially successful retinal detachment procedure. \n\n\n[0345] Scar tissue may be formed in the orbit or on eye and eyelid muscles after squint, orbital or eyelid surgery, or thyroid eye disease, and where scarring of the conjunctiva occurs as may happen after glaucoma surgery or in cicatricial disease, inflammatory disease, for example, pemphigoid, or infective disease, for example, trachoma. A further eye problem associated with the contraction of collagen-including tissues is the opacification and contracture of the lens capsule after cataract extraction. Important role for MMPs has been recognized in ocular diseases including wound healing, dry eye, sterile corneal ulceration, recurrent epithelial erosion, corneal neovascularization, pterygium, conjuctivochalasis, glaucoma, PVR, and ocular fibrosis. \n\n\nLiver fibrosis \n\n\n[0346] Liver fibrosis (LF) is a generally irreversible consequence of hepatic damage of several etiologies. In the Western world, the main etiologic categories are: alcoholic liver disease (30-50%), viral hepatitis (30%), biliary disease (5-10%), primary hemochromatosis \n\n (5%), and drug-related and cryptogenic cirrhosis of, unknown etiology, (10-15%). Wilson's disease, i -antitrypsin deficiency and other rare diseases also have liver fibrosis as one of the symptoms. Liver cirrhosis, the end stage of liver fibrosis, frequently requires liver transplantation and is among the top ten causes of death in the Western world. \n\n\nKidney fibrosis and related conditions. \n\n\nChronic Renal Failure (CRT) \n\n\n[0347] Chronic renal failure is a gradual and progressive loss of the ability of the kidneys to excrete wastes, concentrate urine, and conserve electrolytes. CRF is slowly progressive. It most often results from any disease that causes gradual loss of kidney function, and fibrosis is the main pathology that produces CRF. \n\n\nDiabetic nephropathy \n\n\n[0348] Diabetic nephropathy, hallmarks of which are glomerulosclerosis and \n\n\ntubulointerstitial fibrosis, is the single most prevalent cause of end-stage renal disease in the modern world, and diabetic patients constitute the largest population on dialysis. Such therapy is costly and far from optimal. Transplantation offers a better outcome but suffers from a severe shortage of donors. \n\n\nChronic Kidney Disease \n\n\n[0349] Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem and is recognized as a common condition that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure (CRF). \n\n\n[0350] The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) defines chronic kidney disease as either kidney damage or a decreased kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for three or more months. Other markers of CKD are also known and used for diagnosis. In general, the destruction of renal mass with irreversible sclerosis and loss of nephrons leads to a progressive decline in GFR. Recently, the K/DOQI published a classification of the stages of CKD, as follows: \n\n\n Stage 1 : Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR (>90 mL/min/1.73 ml) Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2) \n\n\n Stage 3: Moderate reduction in GFR (30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) \n\n Stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2) \n\n\n Stage 5: Kidney failure (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis) \n\n\n[0351] In stages 1 and 2 CKD, GFR alone does not confirm the diagnosis. Other markers of kidney damage, including abnormalities in the composition of blood or urine or abnormalities in imaging tests, may be relied upon. \n\n\nPathophysiology of CKD \n\n\n[0352] Approximately 1 million nephrons are present in each kidney, each contributing to the total GFR. Irrespective of the etiology of renal injury, with progressive destruction of nephrons, the kidney is able to maintain GFR by hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining healthy nephrons. This nephron adaptability allows for continued normal clearance of plasma solutes so that substances such as urea and creatinine start to show significant increases in plasma levels only after total GFR has decreased to 50%, when the renal reserve has been exhausted. The plasma creatinine value will approximately double with a 50% reduction in GFR. Therefore, a doubling in plasma creatinine from a baseline value of 0.6 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL in a patient actually represents a loss of 50%) of functioning nephron mass. \n\n\n[0353] The residual nephron hyperfiltration and hypertrophy, although beneficial for the reasons noted, is thought to represent a major cause of progressive renal dysfunction. This is believed to occur because of increased glomerular capillary pressure, which damages the capillaries and leads initially to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and eventually to global glomerulosclerosis. This hypothesis has been based on studies of five-sixths nephrectomized rats, which develop lesions that are identical to those observed in humans with CKD. \n\n\n[0354] The two most common causes of chronic kidney disease are diabetes and hypertension. Other factors include acute insults from nephrotoxins, including contrasting agents, or decreased perfusion; Proteinuria; Increased renal ammoniagenesis with interstitial injury; Hyperlipidemia; Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate deposition; Decreased levels of nitrous oxide and smoking. \n\n\n[0355] In the United States, the incidence and prevalence of CKD is rising, with poor outcomes and high cost to the health system. Kidney disease is the ninth leading cause of \n\n death in the US. The high rate of mortality has led the US Surgeon General's mandate for America's citizenry, Healthy People 2010, to contain a chapter focused on CKD. The objectives of this chapter are to articulate goals and to provide strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and health costs of chronic kidney disease in the United States. \n\n\n[0356] The incidence rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have also increased steadily internationally since 1989. The United States has the highest incident rate of ESRD, followed by Japan. Japan has the highest prevalence per million population, followed by the US. \n\n\n[0357] The mortality rates associated with hemodialysis are striking and indicate that the life expectancy of patients entering into hemodialysis is markedly shortened. At every age, patients with ESRD on dialysis have significantly increased mortality when compared with nondialysis patients and individuals without kidney disease. At age 60 years, a healthy person can expect to live for more than 20 years, whereas the life expectancy of a 60-year-old patient starting hemodialysis is closer to 4 years (Aurora and Verelli, May 21, 2009. Chronic Renal Failure: Treatment & Medication. Emedicine. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/238798- treatment). \n\n\nPulmonary fibrosis \n\n\n[0358] Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is scarring of the lung caused by a variety of inhaled agents including mineral particles, organic dusts, and oxidant gases, or by unknown reasons (idiopathic lung fibrosis). The disease afflicts millions of individuals worldwide, and there are no effective therapeutic approaches. A major reason for the lack of useful treatments is that few of the molecular mechanisms of disease have been defined sufficiently to design appropriate targets for therapy (Lasky JA., Brody AR. (2000), \"Interstitial fibrosis and growth factors\", Environ Health Perspect.;108 Suppl 4:751-62). \n\n\nCardiac fibrosis \n\n\n[0359] Heart failure is unique among the major cardiovascular disorders in that it alone is increasing in prevalence while there has been a striking decrease in other conditions. Some of this can be attributed to the aging of the populations of the United States and Europe. The ability to salvage patients with myocardial damage is also a major factor, as these patients \n\n may develop progression of left ventricular dysfunction due to deleterious remodelling of the heart. \n\n\n[0360] The normal myocardium is composed of a variety of cells, cardiac myocytes and noncardiomyocytes, which include endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. \n\n\n[0361] Structural remodeling of the ventricular wall is a key determinant of clinical outcome in heart disease. Such remodeling involves the production and destruction of extracellular matrix proteins, cell proliferation and migration, and apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Cardiac fibroblasts are crucially involved in these processes, producing growth factors and cytokines that act as autocrine and paracrine factors, as well as extracellular matrix proteins and proteinases. Recent studies have shown that the interactions between cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes are essential for the progression of cardiac remodeling of which the net effect is deterioration in cardiac function and the onset of heart failure (Manabe I, et al., (2002), \"Gene expression in fibroblasts and fibrosis: involvement in cardiac hypertrophy\", Circ Res. 13;91(12): 1103-13). \n\n\nBurns and scars \n\n\n[0362] A particular problem which may arise, particularly in fibrotic disease, is contraction of tissues, for example contraction of scars. Contraction of tissues including extracellular matrix components, especially of collagen-including tissues, may occur in connection with many different pathological conditions and with surgical or cosmetic procedures. Contracture, for example, of scars, may cause physical problems, which may lead to the need for medical treatment, or it may cause problems of a purely cosmetic nature. Collagen is the major component of scar and other contracted tissue and as such is the most important structural component to consider. Nevertheless, scar and other contracted tissue also includes other structural components, especially other extracellular matrix components, for example, elastin, which may also contribute to contraction of the tissue. \n\n\n[0363] Contraction of collagen-including tissue, which may also include other \n\n\nextracellular matrix components, frequently occurs in the healing of burns. The burns may be chemical, thermal or radiation burns and may be of the eye, the surface of the skin or the skin and the underlying tissues. It may also be the case that there are burns on internal tissues, for example, caused by radiation treatment. Contraction of burnt tissues is often a problem and \n\n may lead to physical and/or cosmetic problems, for example, loss of movement and/or disfigurement. \n\n\n[0364] Skin grafts may be applied for a variety of reasons and may often undergo contraction after application. As with the healing of burnt tissues the contraction may lead to both physical and cosmetic problems. It is a particularly serious problem where many skin grafts are needed as, for example, in a serious burns case. \n\n\n[0365] Contraction is also a problem in production of artificial skin. To make a true artificial skin it is necessary to have an epidermis made of epithelial cells (keratinocytes) and a dermis made of collagen populated with fibroblasts. It is important to have both types of cells because they signal and stimulate each other using growth factors. The collagen component of the artificial skin often contracts to less than one tenth of its original area when populated by fibroblasts. \n\n\n[0366] Cicatricial contraction, contraction due to shrinkage of the fibrous tissue of a scar, is common. In some cases the scar may become a vicious cicatrix, a scar in which the contraction causes serious deformity. A patient's stomach may be effectively separated into two separate chambers in an hour-glass contracture by the contraction of scar tissue formed when a stomach ulcer heals. Obstruction of passages and ducts, cicatricial stenosis, may occur due to the contraction of scar tissue. Contraction of blood vessels may be due to primary obstruction or surgical trauma, for example, after surgery or angioplasty. Stenosis of other hollow visci, for examples, ureters, may also occur. Problems may occur where any form of scarring takes place, whether resulting from accidental wounds or from surgery. Conditions of the skin and tendons which involve contraction of collagen-including tissues include post-trauma conditions resulting from surgery or accidents, for example, hand or foot tendon injuries, post-graft conditions and pathological conditions, such as scleroderma, Dupuytren's contracture and epidermolysis bullosa. Scarring and contraction of tissues in the eye may occur in various conditions, for example, the sequelae of retinal detachment or diabetic eye disease (as mentioned above). Contraction of the sockets found in the skull for the eyeballs and associated structures, including extra-ocular muscles and eyelids, may occur if there is trauma or inflammatory damage. The tissues contract within the sockets causing a variety of problems including double vision and an unsightly appearance. \n\n [0367] For further information on different types of fibrosis see: Molina V, et al., (2002), \"Fibrotic diseases\", Harefuah, 141(11): 973-8, 1009; Yu L, et al, (2002), \"Therapeutic strategies to halt renal fibrosis\", Curr Opin Pharmacol. 2(2): 177-81; Keane WF and Lyle PA.

A nucleic acid molecule may include a delivery vehicle, including liposomes, for administration to a subject, carriers and diluents and their salts, and/or can be present in pharmaceutically acceptable formulations. \n\n\n[0369] Nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein may be delivered or administered directly with a carrier or diluent but not any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry to the cell, including viral vectors, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. \n\n\n[0370] Nucleic acid molecules may be delivered or administered to a subject by direct application of the nucleic acid molecules with a carrier or diluent or any other delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry into a cell, including viral sequences, viral particular, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. Polypeptides \n\n that facilitate introduction of nucleic acid into a desired subject such as those described in US. Application Publication No. 20070155658 (e.g., a melamine derivative such as 2,4,6- Triguanidino Traizine and 2,4,6-Tramidosarcocyl Melamine, a polyarginine polypeptide, and a polypeptide including alternating glutamine and asparagine residues). \n\n\n[0371] Methods for the delivery of nucleic acid molecules are described in Akhtar et al, Trends Cell Bio., 2: 139 (1992); Delivery Strategies for Antisense Oligonucleotide \n\n\nTherapeutics, ed.

These protocols can be utilized for the delivery of virtually any nucleic acid molecule. Nucleic acid molecules can be administered to cells by a variety of methods known to those of skill in the art, including, but not restricted to, encapsulation in liposomes, by iontophoresis, or by incorporation into other vehicles, such as biodegradable polymers, hydrogels, cyclodextrins (see e.g., Gonzalez et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 10: 1068- 1074 (1999); Wang et al, International PCT publication Nos. WO 03/47518 and WO \n\n\n03/46185), poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) and PLCA microspheres (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,796 and U.S. Application Publication No. 2002130430), biodegradable nanocapsules, and bioadhesive microspheres, or by proteinaceous vectors (O'Hare and Normand, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/53722). Alternatively, the nucleic acid/vehicle combination is locally delivered by direct injection or by use of an infusion pump. Direct injection of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal, can take place using standard needle and syringe \n\n\nmethodologies, or by needle-free technologies such as those described in Corny et al, Clin. Cancer Res., 5: 2330-2337 (1999) and Barry et al, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/31262. The molecules of the instant invention can be used as pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical agents prevent, modulate the occurrence, or treat (alleviate a symptom to some extent, preferably all of the symptoms) of a disease state in a subject. \n\n\n[0372] Nucleic acid molecules may be complexed with cationic lipids, packaged within liposomes, or otherwise delivered to target cells or tissues. The nucleic acid or nucleic acid complexes can be locally administered to relevant tissues ex vivo, or in vivo through direct dermal application, transdermal application, or injection, with or without their incorporation \n\n in biopolymers. The nucleic acid molecules of the invention may include sequences shown in Tables I. Examples of such nucleic acid molecules consist essentially of sequences provided in Table I. \n\n\n[0373] Delivery systems include surface-modified liposomes containing poly (ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-modified, or long-circulating liposomes or stealth liposomes). These formulations offer a method for increasing the accumulation of drugs in target tissues. This class of drug carriers resists opsonization and elimination by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS or RES), thereby enabling longer blood circulation times and enhanced tissue exposure for the encapsulated drug (Lasic et al. Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2601-2627; Ishiwata et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1995, 43, 1005-1011). \n\n\n[0374] Nucleic acid molecules may be formulated or complexed with polyethylenimine (e.g., linear or branched PEI) and/or polyethylenimine derivatives, including for example polyethyleneimine-polyethyleneglycol-N-acetylgalactosamine (PEI-PEG-GAL) or polyethyleneimine-polyethyleneglycol-tri-N-acetylgalactosamine (PEI-PEG-triGAL) derivatives, grafted PEIs such as galactose PEI, cholesterol PEI, antibody derivatized PEI, and polyethylene glycol PEI (PEG-PEI) derivatives thereof (see for example Ogris et al., 2001, AAPA PharmSci, 3, 1-11; Furgeson et al, 2003, Bioconjugate Chem., 14, 840-847; Kunath et al., 2002, Pharmaceutical Research, 19, 810-817; Choi et al., 2001, Bull. Korean Chem. Soc, 22, 46-52; Bettinger et al., 1999, Bioconjugate Chem., 10, 558-561; Peterson et al, 2002, Bioconjugate Chem., 13, 845-854; Erbacher et al, 1999, Journal of Gene Medicine Preprint, 1, l-18; Godbey et al, 1999., PNAS USA, 96, 5177-5181; Godbey et al, 1999, Journal of Controlled Release, 60, 149-160; Diebold et al, 1999, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274, 19087-19094; Thomas and Klibanov, 2002, PNAS USA, 99, 14640-14645; Sagara, U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,524 and United States Patent Application Publication No. 20030077829. \n\n\n[0375] Nucleic acid molecules may be complexed with membrane disruptive agents such as those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20010007666. The membrane disruptive agent or agents and the nucleic acid molecule may also be complexed with a cationic lipid or helper lipid molecule, such as those lipids described in U.S. Pat. No. \n\n\n6,235,310. \n\n\n[0376] The nucleic acid molecules may be administered via pulmonary delivery, such as by inhalation of an aerosol or spray dried formulation administered by an inhalation device or \n\n nebulizer, providing rapid local uptake of the nucleic acid molecules into relevant pulmonary tissues. Solid particulate compositions containing respirable dry particles of micronized nucleic acid compositions can be prepared by grinding dried or lyophilized nucleic acid compositions, and then passing the micronized composition through, for example, a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates. A solid particulate composition comprising the nucleic acid compositions of the invention can optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol as well as other therapeutic compounds. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which can be blended with the nucleic acid compound in any suitable ratio, such as a 1 to 1 ratio by weight. \n\n\n[0377] Aerosols of liquid particles may include a nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and can be produced by any suitable means, such as with a nebulizer (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729). Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions of an active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of a compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable formulations for use in nebulizers include the active ingredient in a liquid carrier in an amount of up to 40% w/w preferably less than 20% w/w of the formulation. The carrier is typically water or a dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made isotonic with body fluids by the addition of, e.g., sodium chloride or other suitable salts. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not prepared sterile, e.g., methyl hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants, flavorings, volatile oils, buffering agents and emulsifiers and other formulation surfactants. The aerosols of solid particles including the active composition and surfactant can likewise be produced with any solid particulate aerosol generator. Aerosol generators for administering solid particulate therapeutics to a subject produce particles which are respirable, as explained above, and generate a volume of aerosol containing a predetermined metered dose of a therapeutic composition at a rate suitable for human administration. One illustrative type of solid particulate aerosol generator is an insufflator. Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely comminuted powders which can be delivered by means of an insufflator. In the insufflator, the powder, e.g., a metered dose thereof effective to carry out the treatments described herein, is contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of a powder blend comprising the active \n\n ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically includes from 0.1 to 100 w/w of the formulation. A second type of illustrative aerosol generator includes a metered dose inhaler. Metered dose inhalers are pressurized aerosol dispensers, typically containing a suspension or solution formulation of the active ingredient in a liquefied propellant. During use these devices discharge the formulation through a valve adapted to deliver a metered volume to produce a fine particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain \n\n\nchlorofluorocarbon compounds, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoro ethane and mixtures thereof. The formulation can additionally contain one or more co-solvents, for example, ethanol, emulsifiers and other formulation surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, anti-oxidants and suitable flavoring agents. Other methods for pulmonary delivery are described in, e.g., US Patent Application No. 20040037780, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,592,904; 6,582,728; 6,565,885. PCT Patent Publiction No. WO2008/132723 relates to aerosol delivery of oligonucleotides in general, and of siRNA in particular, to the respiratory system. \n\n\n[0378] Nucleic acid molecules may be administered to the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). Experiments have demonstrated the efficient in vivo uptake of nucleic acids by neurons. See e.g., Sommer et al, 1998, Antisense Nuc. Acid Drug Dev., 8, 75; Epa et al, 2000, Antisense Nuc. Acid Drug Dev., 10, 469; Broaddus et al, 1998, J. Neurosurg., 88(4), 734; Karle et al, 1997, Eur. J. Pharmocol., 340(2/3), 153; Bannai et al, 1998, Brain Research, 784(1,2), 304; Rajakumar et al, 1997, Synapse, 26(3), 199; Wu-pong et al, 1999, BioPharm, 12(1), 32; Bannai et al, 1998, Brain Res. Protoc, 3(1), 83; and Simantov et al, 1996, Neuroscience, 74(1), 39. Nucleic acid molecules are therefore amenable to delivery to and uptake by cells in the CNS and/or PNS. \n\n\n[0379] Delivery of nucleic acid molecules to the CNS is provided by a variety of different strategies. Traditional approaches to CNS delivery that can be used include, but are not limited to, intrathecal and intracerebroventricular administration, implantation of catheters and pumps, direct injection or perfusion at the site of injury or lesion, injection into the brain arterial system, or by chemical or osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier. Other approaches can include the use of various transport and carrier systems, for example though the use of conjugates and biodegradable polymers. Furthermore, gene therapy approaches, e.g., as described in Kaplitt et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,613 and Davidson, WO 04/013280, can be used to express nucleic acid molecules in the CNS. \n\n [0380] Delivery systems may include, for example, aqueous and nonaqueous gels, creams, multiple emulsions, microemulsions, liposomes, ointments, aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, lotions, aerosols, hydrocarbon bases and powders, and can contain excipients such as solubilizers, permeation enhancers (e.g., fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols and amino acids), and hydrophilic polymers (e.g., polycarbophil and polyvinylpyrolidone). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a liposome or a transdermal enhancer. Examples of liposomes which can be used in this invention include the following: (1) \n\n\nCellFectin, 1 : 1.5 (M/M) liposome formulation of the cationic lipid Ν,ΝΙ,ΝΙΙ,ΝΙΙΙ-tetramethyl- N,NI,NII,NIII-tetrapalmit-y-spermine and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (GIBCO BRL); (2) Cytofectin GSV, 2: 1 (M/M) liposome formulation of a cationic lipid and DOPE (Glen Research); (3) DOTAP (N-[l-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)-N,N,N-tri-methyl- ammoniummethylsulfate) (Boehringer Manheim); and (4) Lipofectamine, 3: 1 (M/M) liposome formulation of the polycationic lipid DOSPA, the neutral lipid DOPE (GIBCO BRL) and Di- Alkylated Amino Acid (DiLA2). \n\n\n[0381] Delivery systems may include patches, tablets, suppositories, pessaries, gels and creams, and can contain excipients such as solubilizers and enhancers (e.g., propylene glycol, bile salts and amino acids), and other vehicles (e.g., polyethylene glycol, fatty acid esters and derivatives, and hydrophilic polymers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hyaluronic acid). \n\n\n[0382] Nucleic acid molecules may be formulated or complexed with polyethylenimine (e.g., linear or branched PEI) and/or polyethylenimine derivatives, including for example grafted PEIs such as galactose PEI, cholesterol PEI, antibody derivatized PEI, and \n\n\npolyethylene glycol PEI (PEG-PEI) derivatives thereof (see for example Ogris et al., 2001, AAPA PharmSci, 3, 1-11; Furgeson et al, 2003, Bioconjugate Chem., 14, 840-847; Kunath et al., 2002, Pharmaceutical Research, 19, 810-817; Choi et al., 2001, Bull. Korean Chem. Soc, 22, 46-52; Bettinger et al., 1999, Bioconjugate Chem., 10, 558-561; Peterson et al, 2002, Bioconjugate Chem., 13, 845-854; Erbacher et al, 1999, Journal of Gene Medicine Preprint, 1, l-18; Godbey et al, 1999., PNAS USA, 96, 5177-5181; Godbey et al, 1999, Journal of Controlled Release, 60, 149-160; Diebold et al, 1999, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274, 19087-19094; Thomas and Klibanov, 2002, PNAS USA, 99, 14640-14645; and Sagara, U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,524. \n\n [0383] Nucleic acid molecules may include a bioconjugate, for example a nucleic acid conjugate as described in Vargeese et al, U.S. Ser. No. 10/427,160; U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,631; U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,434; U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,886; U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,737; U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,136; U.S. Pat. No. 5,138,045. \n\n\n[0384] Compositions, methods and kits disclosed herein may include an expression vector that includes a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one nucleic acid molecule of the invention in a manner that allows expression of the nucleic acid molecule. Methods of introducing nucleic acid molecules or one or more vectors capable of expressing the strands of dsRNA into the environment of the cell will depend on the type of cell and the make up of its environment. The nucleic acid molecule or the vector construct may be directly introduced into the cell (i.e., intracellularly); or introduced extracellularly into a cavity, interstitial space, into the circulation of an organism, introduced orally, or may be introduced by bathing an organism or a cell in a solution containing dsRNA. The cell is preferably a mammalian cell; more preferably a human cell. The nucleic acid molecule of the expression vector can include a sense region and an antisense region. The antisense region can include a sequence complementary to a RNA or DNA sequence encoding hsp47 and the sense region can include a sequence complementary to the antisense region. The nucleic acid molecule can include two distinct strands having complementary sense and antisense regions. The nucleic acid molecule can include a single strand having complementary sense and antisense regions. \n\n\n[0385] Nucleic acid molecules that interact with target RNA molecules and down-regulate gene encoding target RNA molecules (e.g., target RNA molecules referred to by Genbank Accession numbers herein) may be expressed from transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors. Recombinant vectors can be DNA plasmids or viral vectors. Nucleic acid molecule expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on, but not limited to, adeno- associated virus, retrovirus, adenovirus, or alphavirus. The recombinant vectors capable of expressing the nucleic acid molecules can be delivered as described herein, and persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of nucleic acid molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the nucleic acid molecules bind and down-regulate gene function or expression via RNA interference (RNAi). Delivery of nucleic acid molecule expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex -planted from a subject followed by reintroduction into the subject, or by any other means that would allow for introduction into the desired target cell. \n\n [0386] Expression vectors may include a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein, in a manner which allows expression of the nucleic acid molecule. For example, the vector may contain sequence(s) encoding both strands of a nucleic acid molecule that include a duplex. The vector can also contain sequence(s) encoding a single nucleic acid molecule that is self-complementary and thus forms a nucleic acid molecule. Non-limiting examples of such expression vectors are described in Paul et al., 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 505; Miyagishi and Taira, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 497; Lee et al, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 500; and Novina et al, 2002, Nature \n\n\nMedicine, advance online publication doi: 10.1038/nm725. Expression vectors may also be included in a mammalian (e.g., human) cell. \n\n\n[0387] An expression vector may include a nucleic acid sequence encoding two or more nucleic acid molecules, which can be the same or different. Expression vectors may include a sequence for a nucleic acid molecule complementary to a nucleic acid molecule referred to by a Genbank Accession number NM 001235, for example those shown in Table I. \n\n\n[0388] An expression vector may encode one or both strands of a nucleic acid duplex, or a single self-complementary strand that self hybridizes into a nucleic acid duplex. The nucleic acid sequences encoding nucleic acid molecules can be operably linked in a manner that allows expression of the nucleic acid molecule (see for example Paul et al, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 505; Miyagishi and Taira, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 497; Lee et al, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 500; and Novina et al, 2002, Nature Medicine, advance online publication doi: 10.1038/nm725). \n\n\n[0389] An expression vector may include one or more of the following: a) a transcription initiation region (e.g., eukaryotic pol I, II or III initiation region); b) a transcription \n\n\ntermination region (e.g., eukaryotic pol I, II or III termination region); c) an intron and d) a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one of the nucleic acid molecules, wherein said sequence is operably linked to the initiation region and the termination region in a manner that allows expression and/or delivery of the nucleic acid molecule. The vector can optionally include an open reading frame (ORF) for a protein operably linked on the 5' side or the 3'- side of the sequence encoding the nucleic acid molecule; and/or an intron (intervening sequences). \n\n [0390] Transcription of the nucleic acid molecule sequences can be driven from a promoter for eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (pol I), RNA polymerase II (pol II), or RNA polymerase III (pol III). Transcripts from pol II or pol III promoters are expressed at high levels in all cells; the levels of a given pol II promoter in a given cell type depends on the nature of the gene regulatory sequences (enhancers, silencers, etc.) present nearby. \n\n\nProkaryotic RNA polymerase promoters are also used, providing that the prokaryotic RNA polymerase enzyme is expressed in the appropriate cells (Elroy-Stein and Moss, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, 6743-7; Gao and Huang 1993, Nucleic Acids Res., 21, 2867-72; Lieber et al, 1993, Methods EnzymoL, 217, 47-66; Zhou et al, 1990, Mol. Cell. Biol, 10, 4529-37). Several investigators have demonstrated that nucleic acid molecules expressed from such promoters can function in mammalian cells (e.g. Kashani-Sabet et al., 1992, Antisense Res. Dev., 2, 3-15; Ojwang et al, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 10802-6; Chen et al, 1992, Nucleic Acids Res., 20, 4581-9; Yu et al, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 6340-4; L'Huillier et al, 1992, EMBO J., 11, 4411-8; Lisziewicz et al, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 90, 8000-4; Thompson et al, 1995, Nucleic Acids Res., 23, 2259; Sullenger & Cech, 1993, Science, 262, 1566). More specifically, transcription units such as the ones derived from genes encoding U6 small nuclear (snRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and adenovirus VA RNA are useful in generating high concentrations of desired RNA molecules such as siNA in cells (Thompson et al, supra; Couture and Stinchcomb, 1996, supra; \n\n\nNoonberg et al, 1994, Nucleic Acid Res., 22, 2830; Noonberg et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,803; Good et al., 1997, Gene Ther., 4, 45; Beigelman et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 96/18736. The above nucleic acid transcription units can be incorporated into a variety of vectors for introduction into mammalian cells, including but not restricted to, plasmid DNA vectors, viral DNA vectors (such as adenovirus or adeno-associated virus vectors), or viral RNA vectors (such as retroviral or alphavirus vectors) (see Couture and Stinchcomb, 1996 supra). \n\n\n[0391] Nucleic acid molecule may be expressed within cells from eukaryotic promoters (e.g., Izant and Weintraub, 1985, Science, 229, 345; McGarry and Lindquist, 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 83, 399; Scanlon et al, 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, 10591-5; \n\n\nKashani-Sabet et al, 1992, Antisense Res. Dev., 2, 3-15; Dropulic et al, 1992, J. Virol, 66, 1432-41; Weerasinghe et al, 1991, J. Virol, 65, 5531-4; Ojwang et al, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 10802-6; Chen et al, 1992, Nucleic Acids Res., 20, 4581-9; Sarver et al, 1990 Science, 247, 1222-1225; Thompson et al, 1995, Nucleic Acids Res., 23, 2259; Good et \n\n al., 1997, Gene Therapy, 4, 45. Those skilled in the art realize that any nucleic acid can be expressed in eukaryotic cells from the appropriate DNA/RNA vector. The activity of such nucleic acids can be augmented by their release from the primary transcript by a enzymatic nucleic acid (Draper et al, PCT WO 93/23569, and Sullivan et al, PCT WO 94/02595; \n\n\nOhkawa et al, 1992, Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser., 27, 15-6; Taira et al, 1991, Nucleic Acids Res., 19, 5125-30; Ventura et al, 1993, Nucleic Acids Res., 21, 3249-55; Chowrira et al, 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269, 25856. \n\n\n[0392] A viral construct packaged into a viral particle would accomplish both efficient introduction of an expression construct into the cell and transcription of dsRNA construct encoded by the expression construct. \n\n\n[0393] Methods for oral introduction include direct mixing of RNA with food of the organism, as well as engineered approaches in which a species that is used as food is engineered to express an RNA, then fed to the organism to be affected. Physical methods may be employed to introduce a nucleic acid molecule solution into the cell. Physical methods of introducing nucleic acids include injection of a solution containing the nucleic acid molecule, bombardment by particles covered by the nucleic acid molecule, soaking the cell or organism in a solution of the RNA, or electroporation of cell membranes in the presence of the nucleic acid molecule. \n\n\n[0394] Other methods known in the art for introducing nucleic acids to cells may be used, such as lipid-mediated carrier transport, chemical mediated transport, such as calcium phosphate, and the like. Thus the nucleic acid molecules may be introduced along with components that perform one or more of the following activities: enhance RNA uptake by the cell, promote annealing of the duplex strands, stabilize the annealed strands, or other-wise increase inhibition of the target gene. \n\n\n[0395] The nucleic acid molecules or the vector construct can be introduced into the cell using suitable formulations. One preferable formulation is with a lipid formulation such as in Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA), vitamin A coupled liposomes (Sato et al. Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:431-442, PCT Patent Publication No. WO 2006/068232). Lipid formulations can also be administered to animals such as by intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection, or orally or by inhalation or other methods as are known in the art. When the formulation is suitable for administration into animals such as mammals and more \n\n specifically humans, the formulation is also pharmaceutically acceptable. Pharmaceutically acceptable formulations for administering oligonucleotides are known and can be used. In some instances, it may be preferable to formulate dsR A in a buffer or saline solution and directly inject the formulated dsRNA into cells, as in studies with oocytes. The direct injection of dsRNA duplexes may also be done. For suitable methods of introducing dsRNA see U.S. published patent application No. 2004/0203145, 20070265220 which are \n\n\nincorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n[0396] Polymeric nanocapsules or microcapsules facilitate transport and release of the encapsulated or bound dsRNA into the cell. They include polymeric and monomeric materials, especially including polybutylcyanoacrylate. A summary of materials and fabrication methods has been published (see Kreuter, 1991). The polymeric materials which are formed from monomeric and/or oligomeric precursors in the polymerization/nanoparticle generation step, are per se known from the prior art, as are the molecular weights and molecular weight distribution of the polymeric material which a person skilled in the field of manufacturing nanoparticles may suitably select in accordance with the usual skill. \n\n\n[0397] Nucleic acid moles may be formulated as a microemulsion. A microemulsion is a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and \n\n\nthermodynamically stable liquid solution. Typically microemulsions are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a 4th component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. \n\n\n[0398] Surfactants that may be used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (MO750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750), decaglycerol decaoleate (DA0750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules. \n\n\n[0399] Water Soluble Crosslinked Polymers \n\n [0400] Delivery formulations can include water soluble degradable crosslinked polymers that include one or more degradable crosslinking lipid moiety, one or more PEI moiety, and/or one or more mPEG (methyl ether derivative of PEG (methoxypoly (ethylene glycol)). \n\n\n[0401] Degradable lipid moieties preferably include compounds having the following structural motif: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0402] In the above formula, ester linkages are biodegradable groups, R represents a relatively hydrophobic \"lipo\" group, and the structural motif shown occurs m times where m is in the range of about 1 to about 30. For example, in certain embodiments R is selected from the group consisting of C2-C50 alkyl, C2-C50 heteroalkyl, C2 - C50 alkenyl, C2 - C50 heteroalkenyl, C5-C50 aryl; C2-C50 heteroaryl; C2-C50 alkynyl, C2-C50 heteroalkynyl, C2 - C50 carboxyalkenyl, and C2 - C50 carboxyheteroalkenyl. In preferred embodiments, R is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 4 to 30 carbons, more preferably 8 to 24 carbons or a sterol, preferably a cholesteryl moiety. In preferred embodiments, R is oleic, lauric, myristic, palmitic margaric, stearic, arachidic, behenic, or lignoceric. In a most preferred embodiment, R is oleic. \n\n\n[0403] The N in formula (B) may have an electron pair or a bond to a hydrogen atom. When N has an electron pair, the recurring unit may be cationic at low pH. \n\n\n[0404] The degradable crosslinking lipid moiety may be reacted with a polyethyleneimine (PEI) as shown in Scheme A below: \n\n Scheme A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0405] In formula (A), R has the same meanings as described above. The PEI may contain recurring units of formula (B) in which x is an integer in the range of about 1 to about 100 and y is an integer in the range of about 1 to about 100. \n\n\n— -NHCH\n2\nCH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0406] The reaction illustrated in Scheme A may be carried out by intermixing the PEI and the diacrylate (I) in a mutual solvent such as ethanol, methanol or dichloromethane with stirring, preferably at room temperature for several hours, then evaporating the solvent to recover the resulting polymer. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the reaction between the PEI and diacrylate (I) involves a Michael reaction between one or more amines of the PEI with double bond(s) of the diacrylate (see J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry 3rd Ed., pp. 711-712 (1985)). The diacrylate shown in Scheme A may be prepared in the manner as described in US Application No. 11/216,986 (US Publication No. 2006/0258751). \n\n\n[0407] The molecular weight of the PEI is preferably in the range of about 200 to 25,000 Daltons more preferably 400 to 5,000 Daltons, yet more preferably 600 to 2000 Daltons. PEI may be either branched or linear. \n\n\n[0408] The molar ratio of PEI to diacrylate is preferably in the range of about 1 :2 to about 1 :20. The weight average molecular weight of the cationic lipopolymer may be in the range \n\n of about 500 Daltons to about 1,000,000 Daltons preferably in the range of about 2,000 Daltons to about 200,000 Daltons. Molecular weights may be determined by size exclusion chromatography using PEG standards or by agarose gel electrophoresis. \n\n\n[0409] The cationic lipopolymer is preferably degradable, more preferably biodegradable, e.g., degradable by a mechanism selected from the group consisting of hydrolysis, enzyme cleavage, reduction, photo-cleavage, and sonication. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, but it is believed that degradation of the cationic lipopolymer of formula (II) within the cell proceeds by enzymatic cleavage and/or hydrolysis of the ester linkages. \n\n\n[0410] Synthesis may be carried out by reacting the degradable lipid moiety with the PEI moiety as described above. Then the mPEG (methyl ether derivative of PEG (methoxypoly (ethylene glycol)), is added to form the degradable crosslinked polymer. In preferred embodiments, the reaction is carried out at room temperature. The reaction products may be isolated by any means known in the art including chromatographic techniques. In a preferred embodiment, the reaction product may be removed by precipitation followed by \n\n\ncentrifugation. \n\n\nDosages \n\n\n[0411] The useful dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary depending upon such factors as the cell type, or for in vivo use, the age, weight and the particular animal and region thereof to be treated, the particular nucleic acid and delivery method used, the therapeutic or diagnostic use contemplated, and the form of the formulation, for example, suspension, emulsion, micelle or liposome, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Typically, dosage is administered at lower levels and increased until the desired effect is achieved. \n\n\n[0412] When lipids are used to deliver the nucleic acid, the amount of lipid compound that is administered can vary and generally depends upon the amount of nucleic acid being administered. For example, the weight ratio of lipid compound to nucleic acid is preferably from about 1 : 1 to about 30: 1, with a weight ratio of about 5:1 to about 10: 1 being more preferred. \n\n\n[0413] A suitable dosage unit of nucleic acid molecules may be in the range of 0.001 to 0.25 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, or in the range of 0.01 to \n\n 20 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.10 to 5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.1 to 2,5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day. \n\n\n[0414] Suitable amounts of nucleic acid molecules may be introduced and these amounts can be empirically determined using standard methods. Effective concentrations of individual nucleic acid molecule species in the environment of a cell may be about 1 femtomolar, about 50 femtomolar, 100 femtomolar, 1 picomolar, 1.5 picomolar, 2.5 picomolar, 5 picomolar, 10 picomolar, 25 picomolar, 50 picomolar, 100 picomolar, 500 picomolar, 1 nanomolar, 2.5 nanomolar, 5 nanomolar, 10 nanomolar, 25 nanomolar, 50 nanomolar, 100 nanomolar, 500 nanomolar, 1 micromolar, 2.5 micromolar, 5 micromolar, 10 micromolar, 100 micromolar or more. \n\n\n[0415] Dosage may be from 0.01 μg to 1 g per kg of body weight (e.g., 0.1 μ%, 0.25 μg, 0.5 μ& 0.75 μg, 1 μg, 2.5 μg, 5 μ& 10 μ& 25 μ\nβ\n, 50 μ& 100 μg, 250 μ\nδ\n, 500 μ 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg per kg). \n\n\n[0416] Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per subject per day). The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form varies depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. \n\n\n[0417] It is understood that the specific dose level for any particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. \n\n\n[0418] Pharmaceutical compositions that include the nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein may be administered once daily, qid, tid, bid, QD, or at any interval and for any duration that is medically appropriate. However, the therapeutic agent may also be dosed in dosage units containing two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. In that case, the nucleic acid molecules contained in each suh-rinse mav he cnrresnnndinplv smal\n1\n— in order to achieve the total dailv dnsace unit \n\n conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained and consistent release of the dsR A over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art. The dosage unit may contain a corresponding multiple of the daily dose. The \n\n\ncomposition can be compounded in such a way that the sum of the multiple units of a nucleic acid together contain a sufficient dose. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions, kits, and containers \n\n\n[0419] Also provided are compositions, kits, containers and formulations that include a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an siNA molecule) as provided herein for reducing expression of hsp47 for administering or distributing the nucleic acid molecule to a patient. A kit may include at least one container and at least one label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers can be formed from a variety of materials such as glass, metal or plastic. The container can hold amino acid sequence(s), small molecule(s), nucleic acid sequence(s), cell population(s) and/or antibody(s). In one embodiment, the container holds a polynucleotide for use in examining the mRNA expression profile of a cell, together with reagents used for this purpose. In another embodiment a container includes an antibody, binding fragment thereof or specific binding protein for use in evaluating hsp47 protein expression cells and tissues, or for relevant laboratory, prognostic, diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic purposes; indications and/or directions for such uses can be included on or with such container, as can reagents and other compositions or tools used for these purposes. Kits may further include associated indications and/or directions; reagents and other compositions or tools used for such purpose can also be included. \n\n\n[0420] The container can alternatively hold a composition that is effective for treating, diagnosis, prognosing or prophylaxing a condition and can have a sterile access port (for example the container can be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agents in the composition can be a nucleic acid molecule capable of specifically binding hsp47 and/or modulating the function of hsp47. \n\n\n[0421] A kit may further include a second container that includes a pharmaceutically- acceptable buffer, such as phosphate -buffered saline, Ringer's solution and/or dextrose solution. It can further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, stirrers, needles, syringes, and/or package inserts with indications and/or instructions for use. \n\n [0422] The units dosage ampoules or multidose containers, in which the nucleic acid molecules are packaged prior to use, may include an hermetically sealed container enclosing an amount of polynucleotide or solution containing a polynucleotide suitable for a \n\n\npharmaceutically effective dose thereof, or multiples of an effective dose. The polynucleotide is packaged as a sterile formulation, and the hermetically sealed container is designed to preserve sterility of the formulation until use. \n\n\n[0423] The container in which the polynucleotide including a sequence encoding a cellular immune response element or fragment thereof may include a package that is labeled, and the label may bear a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency, for example the Food and Drug Administration, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency under Federal law, of the manufacture, use, or sale of the polynucleotide material therein for human administration. \n\n\n[0424] Federal law requires that the use of pharmaceutical compositions in the therapy of humans be approved by an agency of the Federal government. In the United States, enforcement is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which issues appropriate regulations for securing such approval, detailed in 21 U.S.C. § 301-392. \n\n\nRegulation for biologic material, including products made from the tissues of animals is provided under 42 U.S.C. § 262. Similar approval is required by most foreign countries. Regulations vary from country to country, but individual procedures are well known to those in the art and the compositions and methods provided herein preferably comply accordingly. \n\n\n[0425] The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent on the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the frequency of treatment and the route of \n\n\nadministration. Regimens for continuing therapy, including dose and frequency may be guided by the initial response and clinical judgment. The parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues is preferred, although other parenteral routes, such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation, may be required in specific administration, as for example to the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, bronchial tissues or lungs. \n\n\n[0426] As such, provided herein is a pharmaceutical product which may include a polynucleotide including a sequence encoding a cellular immune response element or fragment thereof in solution in a pharmaceutically acceptable injectable carrier and suitable for introduction interstitially into a tissue to cause cells of the tissue to express a cellular \n\n immune response element or fragment thereof, a container enclosing the solution, and a notice associated with the container in form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use, or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of manufacture, use, or sale of the solution of polynucleotide for human \n\n\nadministration. \n\n\nIndications \n\n\n [0427] The nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein can be used to treat diseases, conditions or disorders associated with hsp47, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, chronic hepatic damage, and fibrillogenesis and any other disease or conditions that are related to or will respond to the levels of hsp47 in a cell or tissue, alone or in combination with other therapies. As such, compositions, kits and methods disclosed herein may include packaging a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein that includes a label or package insert. The label may include indications for use of the nucleic acid molecules such as use for treatment or prevention of liver fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, kidney fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis, and any other disease or conditions that are related to or will respond to the levels of hsp47 in a cell or tissue, alone or in combination with other therapies. A label may include an indication for use in reducing expression of hsp47. A \"package insert\" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications, other therapeutic products to be combined with the packaged product, and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products, etc. \n\n\n[0428] Those skilled in the art will recognize that other anti-fibrosis treatments, drugs and therapies known in the art can be readily combined with the nucleic acid molecules herein (e.g. siNA molecules) and are hence contemplated herein. \n\n\n[0429] The methods and compositions provided herein will now be described in greater detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 \n\n\n Selecting hsp47 Nucleic Acid Molecule Sequences: \n\n\n[0430] Nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA < 25 nucleotides) against Hsp47 were designed using several computer programs including siRNA at Whitehead (Whitehead Institute for \n\n Biomedical Research), IDT siRNA Design (Integrated DNA Technologies), BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen), siDESIGN Center (Dharmacon), and BIOPREDsi (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, part of the Novartis Research Foundation, available at http://www.biopredsi.org/start.html). The sequences of top scored siRNAs from these programs were compared and selected (see Table 1) based on the algorithms as well as the sequence homology between human and rat. Candidate sequences were validated by in vitro knocking down assays. \n\n\n[0431] Several parameters were considered for selecting a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a 21-mer siRNA) sequence. Exemplary parameters include: \n\n\n1) thermodynamic stability (RISC favors the strand with less stable 5' end)\n\n\n2) 30-52% GC content \n\n\n 3) positional nucleotide preference: \n\n\n (C/ G)NNNNNNNN( A/U) 1 ONNNNNNNN( A/U) , where N is any nucleotide\n\n\n4) devoid of putative immunostimulatory motifs \n\n\n 5) 2-nucleotide 3' overhang \n\n\n 6) position of siRNA within the transcript (preferably within cDNA region)\n\n\n7) sequence specificity (checked by using BLAST) \n\n\n 8) variations in single nucleotide by checking SNP database \n\n\n[0432] siRNA sequences having < 25 nucleotides were designed based on the foregoing methods. Corresponding Dicer substrate siRNA (e.g., > 26 nucleotides) were designed based on the smaller sequences and extend the target site of the siNA < 25 nucleotide by adding 4 bases to the 3 '-end of the sense strand and 6 bases to the 5 '-end of the antisense strand. The Dicer substrates that were made generally have a 25 base sense strand a 27 base antisense strand with an asymmetric blunt ended and 3 '-overhang molecule. The sequences of the sense and the anti-sense strand without base modification (base sequence) and with modifications (experimental sequence) are provided in Table 1. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 \n\n\n [0433] In order to screen for the potent of various siNA molecules against both the human and rat hsp47 genes, various reporter cell lines were established by lenti-viral induction of human HSP47 cDNA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or rat GP46 cDNA-GFP construct into 293, HT1080, human HSC line hTERT, or NRK cell lines. These cell lines were further \n\n evaluated by siRNA against GFP. The remaining fluorescence signal was measured and normalized to scrambled siRNA (Ambion) and subsequently normalized to cell viability. The results showed that siRNA against GFP knocks down the fluorescence to different extent in different cell lines (Fig. 1). 293 HSP47-GFP and 293 GP46-GFP cell lines were selected for siHsp47 screening due to their ease of transfection and sensitivity to fluorescence knockdown. siRNA transfection: \n\n\n[0434] Cells were transfected with 1.5 pmol per well of siNA against GFP in 96-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in a reverse transfection manner. Cells were seeded at 6,000 cells per well and mixed with the siNA complexs. \n\n\nFluorescence readings were taken after 72 hours incubation on a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek). \n\n\nCell viability assay: \n\n\n[0435] Cells treated with or without siNA were measured for viability after 72 hours incubation using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit according to the manual (Promega). The readings were normalized to samples treated with scrambled siNA \n\n\nmolecules. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 \n\n\n Evaluation of inhibitory efficiency of siHsp47 on hsp47 expression in reporter cell lines \n\n\n[0436] siNAs against hsp47 were evaluated for their inhibitory efficiency in 293 HSP47- GFP and 293 GP46-GFP cell lines by evaluating the change in fluorescent signal from the reporter GFP. The experiments were carried out as described in Example 2. The fluorescent signals were normalized to fluorescent signals from cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Ambion) which served as a control. The results indicate that the tested hsp47 siNA molecules were effective in inhibiting hsp47 mRNA in both cell lines. However, siNA against GP46 mRNA (as published in the 2008 Sato et al paper) was effective only in the 293 GP46-GFP cell line. The results are shown in Fig. 2 A-B. \n\n\n[0437] The 293 HSP47-GFP and 293 GP46-GFP cell lines treated with siRNA against hsp47 and gp46 were evaluated for viability using the methods described in Example 2. The cell viability was normalized to cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Ambion). The results indicate that the cell viability was not affected significantly by the treatment with siNA \n\n molecules. However, the cell viability of 293 HSP47-GFP cell lines treated with different hsp47 siNA molecules varied depending on the siNA molecules used, while the viability of 293 GP46-GFP cell lines were similar. Viability for 293 HSP47-GFP cells were lower for siHsp47-6 and Hsp47-7 treated cells than the rest. The results are shown in Fig. 2C-D. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4 \n\n\n Evaluation of siHsp47 inhibitory effect on hsp47 mRNA by TaqMan® qPCR \n\n\n[0438] In Example 3, the knock down efficiency of siHsp47s in reporter cell lines was evaluated by change in fluorescent signal. To validate the results at the mRNA level, siRNAs targeting endogenous hsp47 were transfected into cells of the human HSC cell line hTERT using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in a reverse transfection manner as described in Example 2. \n\n\n[0439] The hsp47 mRNA level was evaluated for knock down efficiency of the various tested siHsp47 siNA molecules. Briefly, mRNA were isolated from hTERT cells after 72 hours after transfection using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The level of hsp47 mRNA was determined by reverse transcription coupled with quantitative PCR using TaqMan® probes. Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and subjected to TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (ABI, hsp47 assay ID Hs01060395_gl). The level of hsp47 mRNA was normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA according to the manufacturer's instruction (ABI). The results indicate that siHsp47-C was the most effective among all the hsp47 siRNAs, siHsp47-2 and siHsp47-2d were the next most effective. The combinations of siHsp47-l with siHsp47-2 or siHsp47-l with siHsp47-2d were more effective than siHsp47-l alone. The results are shown in Fig. 3. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5 \n\n\n Validation of siHsp47 knock down effect at the protein level \n\n\n[0440] The inhibitory effect of different Hsp47 siNA molecules (siHsp47) on hsp47 mRNA expression were validated at the protein level by measuring the HSP47 in hTERT cells transfected with different siHsp47. Transfection of hTERT cells with different siHsp47 were performed as described in Example 2. Transfected hTERT cells were lysed and the cell lysate were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins in the clarified cell lysate were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The level of HSP47 protein in the cell lysate were \n\n determined using an anti-HSP47 antibody (Assay Designs) as the primary antibody, Goat anti- mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (Millipore) as the secondary antibody, and subsequently detected by Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Anti-actin antibody (Abeam) was used as a protein loading control. The result showed significant decrease in the level of Hsp47 protein in cells treated with siHsp47-C, siHsp47-2d, alone or combination of siHsp47-l with siHsp47-2d. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6 \n\n\n Downregulation of Collagen I expression by hsp47 siRNA \n\n\n[0441] To determine the effect of siHsp47 on collagen I expression level, collagen I mRNA level in hTERT cells treated with different siRNA against hsp47 was measured. \n\n\nBriefly, hTERT cells were trans fected with different siHsp47 as described in Example 2. The cells were lysed after 72 hours and mRNA were isolated using RNeasy mini kit according to the manual (Qiagen). The level of collagen 1 mRNA was determined by reverse transcription coupled with quantitative PCR using TaqMan® probes. Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI) according to the manual, and subjected to TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (ABI, COL1A1 assay ID Hs01076780_gl). The level of collagen I mRNA was normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA according to the manufacturer's instruction (ABI). The signals were normalized to the signal obtained from cells transfected with scrambled siNA. The result indicated that collagen I mRNA level is significantly reduced in the cells treated with some of the candidates siHsp47-2, siHsp47- 2d, and their combination with siHsp47-l and shown in Fig. 4. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7 \n\n\n Immunofluorescence staining of hsp47 siRNA treated hTERT cells \n\n\n[0442] To visualize the expression of two fibrosis markers, collagen I and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), in hTERT cells transfected with or without siHsp47, the cells were stained with rabbit anti-collagen I antibody (Abeam) and mouse anti-alpha-SMA antibody (Sigma). Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen (Molecular Probes)) were used as secondary antibodies to visualize collagen I (green) and alpha-SMA (red). Hoescht was used to visualize nuleus (blue). The results indicate correlation between siRNA knocking down of some of the target genes and collagen/SMA expression. \n\n EXAMPLE 8 \n\n\n In vivo testing of siHSP47 in animal models of liver fibrosis \n\n\n[0443] siRNA for rat liver cirrhosis treatment \n\n\nThe siRNA duplex sequence for HSP47 (siHSP47C) is as listed below. \n\n\nSense (5'->3') ggacaggccucuacaacuaTT \n\n\nAntisense (5'->3') uaguuguagaggccuguccTT \n\n\n[0444] 10 mg/ml siRNA stock solution was prepared by dissolving in nuclease free water (Ambion). For treatment of cirrhotic rats, siRNA was formulated with vitamin A-coupled liposome as described by Sato et al (Sato Y. et al. Nature Biotechnology 2008. Vol.26, p431) in order to target activated hepatic stellate cells that produce collagen. The vitamin A (VA)- liposome-siRNA formulation consists of 0.33 μιηοΐ/ιηΐ of VA, 0.33 μιηοΐ/ιηΐ of liposome (Coatsome EL-01-D, NOF Corporation) and 0.5 μg/μl of siRNA in 5% glucose solution. \n\n\n[0445] The liver cirrhosis animal model was reported by Sato et al (Sato Y. et al. Nature Biotechnology 2008. Vol.26, p431). 4 week-old male SD rats were induced with liver cirrhosis with 0.5% dimethylnitrosoamine (DMN) (Wako Chemicals, Japan) in phosphate- buffered saline (PBS). A dose of 2 ml/kg per body weight was administered intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days per week on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40 \n\n\n[0446] siRNA treatment: siRNA treatment was carried out from day 32 and for 5 intravenous injections. In detail, rats were treated with siRNA on day-32, 34, 36, 38 and 40. Then rats were sacrificed on day-42 or 43. 3 different siRNA doses (1.5mg siRNA per kg body weight, 2.25mg siRNA per kg body weight, 3.0mg siRNA per kg body weight) were tested. Detail of tested groups and number of animals in each group are as follows: \n\n\n1) Cirrhosis was induced by DMN injection, then 5% glucose was injected instead of siRNA) (n=10) \n\n\n 2) VA-Lip-siHSP47C 1.5 mg/kg (n=10) \n\n\n 3) VA-Lip-siHSP47C 2.25 mg/kg (n= 10) \n\n\n 4) VA-Lip-siHSP47C 3.0 mg/Kg (n=10) \n\n 5) Sham (PBS was injected instead of DMN. 5%Glucose was injected instead of siRNA) (n=6) \n\n\n 6) No treatment control (Intact) (n=6) \n\n\nVA-Lip refers to vitamin A - liposome complex. \n\n\n[0447] Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy: On day 43, 2 out of 10 animals in the \"diseased rat\" group and 1 out of 10 animals in \"VA-Lip-siHSP47C siRNA 1.5 mg/kg\" died due to development of liver cirrhosis. The remainder of the animals survived. After rats were sacrificed, liver tissues were fixed in 10% formalin. Then, the left lobule of each liver was embedded in paraffin for histology. Tissue slides were stained with Sirius red, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Sirius red staining was employed to visualize collagen-deposits and to determine the level of cirrhosis. HE staining was for nuclei and cytoplasm as counter- staining. Each slide was observed under microscope (BZ-8000, Keyence Corp. Japan) and percentage of Sirius red-stained area per slide was determined by image analysis software attached to the microscope. At least 4 slides per each liver were prepared for image analysis, and whole area of each slide (slice of liver) was captured by camera and analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t-test. \n\n\n[0448] Results: Figure 5 shows the fibrotic areas. The area of fibrosis in \"diseased rats\" was higher than in the \"sham\" or \"no treatment control\" groups. Therefore, DMN treatment induced collagen deposition in the liver, which was a typical observation of liver fibrosis. However, the area of fibrosis was significantly reduced by the treatment of siRNA targeting HSP47 gene, compared with \"disease rat\" group (Figure 5). This result indicates that siRNA as disclosed herein has a therapeutic efficacy in actual disease. \n\n\n[0449] Additional siRNA compounds are tested in the liver fibrosis animal model, and were shown to reduce the fibrotic area in the liver. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9 \n\n\n Generation of sequences for active double stranded RNA compounds to HSP47/SERPINH1 and production of the siRNAs shown in tables A- 18, A- 19, and B-E. \n\n\n[0450] Using proprietary algorithms and the known sequence of the target genes, the sequences of many potential siRNAs were generated. The sequences that have been generated using this method are complementary to the corresponding mRNA sequence. \n\n [0451] Duplexes are generated by annealing complementary single stranded oligonucleotides. In a laminar flow hood, a ~500μΜ Stock Solution of single stranded oligonucleotide is prepared by diluting in WFI (water for injection, Norbrook). Actual ssRNA concentrations are determined by diluting each 500μΜ ssRNA 1 :200 using WFI, and measuring the OD using Nano Drop. The procedure is repeated 3 times and the average concentration is calculated. The Stock Solution was then diluted to a final concentration of 250μΜ. Complementary single strands were annealed by heating to 850C and allowing to cool to room temperature over at least 45 minutes. Duplexes were tested for complete annealing by testing 5μ1 on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and staining. Samples were stored at - 80OC. \n\n\n[0452] Tables A-18, A-19 and B-E provide siRNAs for HSP47/SERPINH1. For each gene there is a separate list of 19-mer siRNA sequences, which are prioritized based on their score in the proprietary algorithm as the best sequences for targeting the human gene expression. \n\n\n[0453] The following abbreviations are used in the Tables A-18, A-19 and B-E herein: \"other spec or Sp.\" refers to cross species identity with other animals: D-dog, Rt-rat, Rb- Rabbit, Rh-rhesus monkey, P- Pig, M-Mouse; ORF: open reading frame. 19-mers, and 18+1- mers refer to oligomers of 19 and 18+1 (U in position 1 of Antisense, A in position 19 of sense strand) ribonucleic acids in length, respectively. \n\n\nIn vitro testing of the siRNA compounds for the target genes \n\n\nLow- Throughput- Screen (LTS).for siRNA oligos directed to human and rat SERPINH1 gene. \n\n\n[0454] Cell Lines: Human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells (ATCC, Cat# CRL-1435) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2mM L-Glutamine and human epithelial cervical cancer HeLa cells (ATCC, Cat#CCL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L- glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% C02. \n\n\n[0455] About 2X10\n5\n human PC-3 cells endogenously expressing SERPINHl gene, were inoculated in 1.5 mL growth medium in order to reach 30-50% confluence after 24 hours. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent to a final concentration of 0.01-5 \n\n nM per transfected cells. Cells were incubated at 37+PC, 5% C0\n2\n for 48 hours. siRNA transfected cells were harvested and RNA was isolated using EZ-RNA kit [Biological Industries (#20-410-100)]. \n\n\n[0456] Reverse transcription was performed as follows: Synthesis of cDNA was performed and human SERPINHl mRNA levels were determined by Real Time qPCR and normalized to those of the Cyclophilin A (CYNA, PPIA) mRNA for each sample. siRNA activity was determined based on the ratio of the SERPINHl mRNA quantity in siRNA- treated samples versus non-transfected control samples. \n\n\n[0457] The most active sequences were selected from further assays. From Table A- 18 siRNA compounds SERPINHl 2, SERPINH1 6, SERPINH1 13, SERPINHl 45 \n\n\nSERPINHl_45a„ SERPINH1 51, SERPINHl_51a, SERPINH1 52 and SERPINH1 86 were selected as preferred compounds. From Table A-19 siRNA compounds SERPINH1 4, SERPINH1 12, SERPINH1 18, SERPINH1 30, SERPINHl 58 and SERPINHl 88 were selected as preferred compounds. \n\n\n[0458] Other preferred compounds include SERPINH1 50, SERPINH1 67, \n\n\nSERPINHl 73, SERPINHl 74. \n\n\nIC50 values for the LTS selected SERPINHl siRNA oligos \n\n\n[0459] About 2X10\n5\n human PC-3 or 0.9X10\n5\n rat REF52 cells endogenously expressing SERPINHl gene, were inoculated in 1.5 mL growth medium in order to reach 30-50% confluence. Cells were transfected with SERPINHl double stranded RNA compounds (i.e. SERPINH1_2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 18, 45, 51, 58, 88) with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent to reach final transfection concentrations ranging between 0.0029 -100 nM. As negative control cells are treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent or with Synthetic randomized-sequence, non- targeting siRNA at final concentrations of 20-100 nM. Cy3 -labeled siRNA transfected cells were used as positive control for transfection efficiency. \n\n\n[0460] Cells were incubated at 37+FC, 5% C02 for 48 hours. siRNA transfected cells were harvested and RNA was isolated using EZ-RNA kit [Biological Industries (#20-410- 100) Reverse transcription: Synthesis of cDNA is performed and human SERPINHl mRNA levels weredetermined by Real Time qPCR and normalized to those of the Cyclophilin A (CYNA, PPIA) mRNA for each sample. \n\n [0461] The IC50 value of the tested RNAi activity was determined by constructing a dose- response curve using the activity results obtained with the various final siRNA concentrations. The dose response curve was constructed by plotting the relative amount of residual \n\n\nSERPINH1 mRNA versus the logarithm of trans fected siRNA concentration. The curve is calculated by fitting the best sigmoid curve to the measured data. The method for the sigmoid fit is also known as a 3 -point curve fit. \nv\n \n\n\n \n\n where Y is the residual SERPINH1 mRNA response, is the logarithm of transfected siRNA concentration, Bot is the Y value at the bottom plateau, LogIC50 is the X value when 7 is halfway between bottom and top plateaus and HillSlope is the steepness of the curve. \n\n\n[0462] The percent of inhibition of gene expression using specific siRNAs was determined using qPCR analysis of target gene in cells expressing the endogenous gene. \n\n\nOther siRNA compounds according to Tables A-18, A-19 and B-E are tested in vitro where it is shown that these siRNA compounds inhibit gene expression. Activity is shown as percent residual mRNA; accordingly, a lower value reflects better activity. \n\n\n[0463] In order to test the stability of the siRNA compounds in serum, specific siRNA molecules were incubated in four different batches of human serum (100% concentration) at 37°C for up to 24 hours. Samples are collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 16 and 24 hours. The migration patterns as an indication of were determined at each collection time by \n\n\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). \n\n\n[0464] Table 3 shows IC50 (or activity where IC50 not calculated) in human cell line for unmodified double stranded nucleic acid compounds (sense and antisense strand unmodified, dTdT 3' terminal overhangs) selected from Tables A- 18 and A-19. \n\n Table 3 \n\n\n \n\n siRNA Knock Down activity: \n\n\n [0465] About 2x105 human PC-3 cells endogenously expressing SERPINH1 gene were seeded per well in 6 well plates and allowed to grow for about 24hr to 30-70% confluency. Cells were transfected with the siRNAs being tested at different concentrations using the Lipofectamine™2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% C02 incubator for either 48h or 72h. At 48-72h after transfection cells were harvested and cell RNA was extracted. Cy3 -labeled siRNA duplexes were used as a positive control for transfection efficiency. Mock cells treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent defined as \"Control not active samples\" (negative control) and cells treated with a known active siRNA (HSP47-C) at final concentration of 5nM defined as \"Control active samples\" (positive control). Z' and controls fold {Fold=mean (Negative)/mean (Positive)} are the means to describe the assay efficiency. \n\n\n[0466] The percent inhibition of target gene expression by each siRNA tested was determined by Qpcr analysis of a target mRNA from cells. Reverse transcription was performed by synthesizing cDNA from the cells and determining target gene mRNA levels by Real Time qPCR. Measured cell mRNA levels were normalized to those of the Cyclophilin A (CYNA, PPIA) mRNA for each sample. siRNA activity was determined based on the ratio of the target gene mRNA quantity siRNA-treated samples versus non-transfected control samples. Z' and controls fold {Fold=mean (Negative)/mean(Positive)} are the means to describe the assay efficiency. \n\n\n[0467] The qPCR results are those that passed QC standards, i.e. the value of the standard curve slope was in the interval [-4, -3], R2 >0.99, no primer dimers. Results that did not pass the QC requirements were disqualified from analysis. \n\n\n[0468] IC50 value of the tested RNAi activity was determined by constructing a dose- response curve using the activity results obtained with the various final siRNA concentrations. The dose response curve was constructed by plotting the relative amount of residual \n\n\nSERPINH1 mRNA versus the logarithm of transfected siRNA concentration, asdescribed above. \n\n\nOn-target and off-target testing of double stranded RNA molecules: \n\n\n [0469] The psiCHECK system enables evaluation of the guide strand (GS) (antisense) and the passenger strand (PS) (sense strand) to elicit targeted (on-target) and off-targeted \n\n effects, by monitoring the changes in expression levels of their target sequences. Four psiCHECK™-2-based (Promega) constructs were prepared for the evaluation of target activity and potential off-target activity of each test molecule GS and PS strands. In each of the constructs one copy or three copies of either the full target or the seed-target sequence, of test molecule PS or GS, was cloned into the multiple cloning site located downstream of the Renilla luciferase translational stop codon in the 3'-UTR region. \n\n\n[0470] The resulting vectors were termed: \n\n\n [0471] 1- GS-CM (guide strand, complete-match) vector containing one copy of the full target sequence (nucleotide sequence fully complementary to the whole 19-base sequence of the GS of the test molecule); \n\n\n [0472] 2- PS-CM (passenger strand, complete-match) vector containg one copy of the full target sequence (nucleotide sequence fully complementary to the whole 19-base sequence of the PS of the test molecule); \n\n\n[0473] 3- GS-SM (guide strand, seed-match) vector containing one copy or three copies of the seed region target sequence (sequence complementary to nucleotides 1-8 of the GS of the test molecule); \n\n\n[0474] 4- PS-SM (passenger strand, seed-match) vector containing one copy of the seed region target sequence (sequence complementary to nucleotides 1-8 of the PS of the test molecule). \n\n\n Nomenclature: \n\n\n [0475] guide strand: strand of siRNA that enters the RISC complex and guides cleavage/silencing of the complementary RNA sequence \n\n\n[0476] seed sequence: Nucleotides 2-8 from the 5 'end of the guide strand. \n\n\n [0477] cm (complete match): DNA fragment fully complementary to the guide strand of siRNA. This DNA fragment is cloned in 3'UTR of a reporter gene and serves as a target for the straightforward RNA silencing. \n\n\n [0478] sm (seed match): 19-mer DNA fragment with nucleotides ns 12-18 fully complementary to the ns 2-8 of the guide strand of siRNA. This DNA fragment is cloned in 3'UTR of a reporter gene and serves as a target for the \"off-target\" silencing. \n\n\n [0479] XI : A single copy of cm or sm cloned in 3 'UTR of a reporter gene. \n\n [0480] X3 Three copies of cm or sm cloned in 3'UTR of a reporter gene, separated with 4 nucleotides one from another. \n\n\n Table 4 non-limiting examples of psiCHECK cloning targets \n\n\n \n\n (ttcc - a spacer) \n\n\nS2s_sm_X3 SERPINH1 2, sense seed CTCGAGGCGATACAAACTGTGTCTAtt match, a triple copy ccGCGATACAAACTGTGTCTAttccGCG clone name ATACAAACTGTGTCTAGCGGCCGC \n\n\n SEQ_ID_NO:2733 \n\n\n (ttcc - a spacer) \n\n\n[0481] The target sequences are cloned using the Xhol and NotI compatible restriction enzyme sites.

Xhol and Notl were used as cloning sites using standard molecular biology techniques. Each strand was chemically synthesized and annealed by heating to 100°C and cooled to room temperature. Ligation was carried out for 3 hours using standard molecular biology techniques and transformed into E. coli DH5a cells. Resulting colonies were screened for presence of plasmid constructs by colony-PCR using relevant primers. Each of the plasmids (vectors) was purified from one positive colony and its sequence was verified. \n\n [0484] About 1.3x106 human HeLa cells were inoculated in 10 cm dish. Cells were then incubated in 37±1°C, 5% C02 incubator for 24 hours. Growth medium was replaced one day post inoculation by 8 mL fresh growth medium and each plate was transfected with one of the plasmids mentioned above, using Lipofectamine™2000 reagent according manufacturing protocol and incubated for 5 hours at 37±10C and 5% C02. Following incubation, cells were re-plated in a 96-well plate at final concentration of 5x103 cells per well in 80 growth medium. 16 hours later, cells were transfected with SERPINH1 siRNA molecules using Lipofectamine™2000 reagent at different concentrations ranging from 0.00 InM to 5nM in a ΙΟΟμί final volume. Mock cells treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent with the corresponding psiCHECK™-2 plasmid defined as \"Control not active samples\" (negative control) and cells treated with a known active siRNA (HSP47-C) at final concentration of 5nM defined as \"Control active samples\" (positive control). Z' and controls fold {Fold=mean (Negative)/mean(Positive)} are the means to describe the assay efficiency. \n\n\n[0485] Cells were then incubated for 48 hours at 37±1°C and Renilla and FireFly \n\n\nLuciferase activities were measured in each of the siRNA transfected samples, using Dual- Luciferase® Assay kit (Promega, Cat#E1960) according to manufacturer procedure. The activity of a synthetic siRNA toward this target sequence results either in cleavage and subsequent degradation of the fused mRNA or in translation inhibition of the encoded protein. Measuring the decrease in Renilla luciferase activity thus provides a convenient way of monitoring siRNA effect while Firefly luciferase, allows normalization of Renilla luciferase expression. Renilla Luciferase activity value was divided by Firefly Luciferase activity value for each sample (normalization). Renilla luciferase activity is finally expressed as the percentage of the normalized activity value in tested sample relative to \"Control not active samples\". \n\n\n[0486] Results of TNFa and IL-6 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) exposed to unmodified or modified siRNA/Lipofectamine™2000.

(siRNA stock lOOuM diluted in human serum 1 : 14.29 or human tissue extract from various tissue types). Five ul (5ul) are added to 15ul 1.5xTBE- loading buffer at different time points (for example 0, 30min, lh, 3h, 6h, 8h, lOh, 16h and 24h). Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -20°C. \n\n\n[0491] Each sample is loaded onto a non-denaturing 20% acrylamide gel, prepared according to methods known in the art. The oligos were visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light. \n\n\nExonuclease Stability Assay \n\n\n [0492] To study the stabilization effect of 3 ' non-nucleotide moieties on a nucleic acid molecule the sense strand, the antisense strand and the annealed siRNA duplex are incubated in cytosolic extracts prepared from different cell types. \n\n\nExtract: HCT116 cytosolic extract (12mg/ml). \n\n Extract buffer: 25mM Hepes pH-7.3 at 37oC; 8mM MgCl; 150mM NaCl with ImM DTT was added fresh immediately before use. \n\n\n[0493] Method: 3.5ml of test siRNA (lOOmM), were mixed with 46.5ml contain 120mg of HCT116 cytosolic extract. The 46.5ml consists of 12ml of HCT116 extract, and 34.5ml of the extract buffer supplemented with DTT and protease inhibitors cocktail/100 (Calbiochem, setIII-539134). The final concentration of the siRNA in the incubation tube is 7mM. The sample was incubated at 37oC, and at the indicated time point 5ml were moved to fresh tube, mixed with 15ml of lXTBE-50% Glycerol loading buffer, and snap frozen in Liquid N2. The final concentration of the siRNA in the loading buffer is 1.75mM (21ng siRNA/ml). For Analyses by native PAGE and EtBr staining 50ng are loaded per lane. For Northern analyses lng of tested siRNA was loaded per lane. \n\n\nInnate Immune response to SERPINH 1 siRNA molecules: \n\n\n [0494] Fresh human blood (at RT) was mixed at 1 : 1 ratio with sterile 0.9% NaCl at RT, and gently loaded (1 :2 ratio) on Ficoll (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield cat# 1114547). Samples were centrifuged at RT (22°C, 800g) in a swinging centrifuge for 30 minutes, washed with RPMI1640 medium and centrifuged (RT, 250 g) for 10 minutes. Cells were counted and seeded at final concentration of 1.5X10\n6\n cell/ml in growth medium \n\n\n (RPMI1640+10%FBS+2mM L-glutamine + 1% Pen-Strep) and incubated for 1 hours at 37°C before siRNA treatment. \n\n\n[0495] Cells were then treated with the siRNAs being tested at different concentrations using the Lipofectamine™2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according manufacturer's instructions and incubated at 370C in a 5% C02 incubator for 24hours. \n\n\n[0496] As a positive control for IFN response, cells were treated with either poly(LC), a synthetic analog of double strand RNA (dsRNA) which is a TLR3 ligand (InvivoGen Cat# tlrl-pic) at final concentrations of 0.25-5.0 μg/mL or to Thiazolaquinolone (CL075), a TLR 7/8 ligand (InvivoGen Cat# tlrl-c75) at final concentrations of 0.075-2 μg/mL. Cell treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent were used as negative (reference) control for IFN response. \n\n\n[0497] At about 24 hours following incubation, cells were collected and supernatant was transferred to new tubes. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a cytokines was tested using IL-6, DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D System DY2060), \n\n and TNF-α, DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D System DY210), according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from the cell pellets and mRNA levels of human genes IFITl (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) and MX1 (myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1, interferon-inducible protein p78) were measured by qPCR. Measured mRNA quantities were normalized to the mRNA quantity of the reference gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A; CycloA). Induction of IFN-signaling was evaluated by comparing the quantity of mRNA from IFITl and MX1 genes from treated cells, relative to their quantities non-treated cells. The qPCR results are those that passed QC standards, i.e. the value of the standard curve slope was in the interval [-4, -3], R2 >0.99, no primer dimers. Results that did not pass the QC requirements were disqualified from analysis. \n\n\n[0498] Table 6 shows siSERPINHl compounds.

fibrotic conditions \n\n\n[0500] Testing the active siRNAs of the invention may be done in predictive animal models. Rat diabetic and aging models of kidney fibrosis include Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, aged fa/fa (obese Zucker) rats, aged Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats; GK rats are an inbred strain derived from Wistar rats, selected for spontaneous \n\n development of NIDDM (diabetes type II). Induced models of kidney fibrosis include the permanent unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model which is a model of acute interstitial fibrosis occurring in healthy non-diabetic animals; renal fibrosis develops within days following the obstruction. Another induced model of kidney fibrosis is 5/6 nephrectomy. \n\n\n[0501] Two models of liver fibrosis in rats are the Bile Duct Ligation (BDL) with sham operation as controls, and CC14 poisoning, with olive oil fed animals as controls, as described in the following references: Lotersztajn S, et al Hepatic Fibrosis: Molecular Mechanisms and Drug Targets.

Weinreb O, Dovrat A.; Curr Eye Res. 2004 Jul;29(l):51-8. \n\n\n[0504] The compounds of Table A- 18 and Table A- 19 are tested in these models of fibrotic conditions, in which it is found that they are effective in treating liver fibrosis and other fibrotic conditions. \n\n Model systems of glaucoma \n\n\n[0505] Testing the active siRNA of the invention for treating or preventing glaucoma is preformed in rat animal model for optic nerve crush described for example in: Maeda, K. et al., \"A Novel Neuroprotectant against Retinal Ganglion Cell Damage in a Glaucoma Model and an Optic Nerve Crush Model in the rat\", Investigative Ophthalmology and visual Science (IOVS), March 2004, 45(3)851. Specifically, for optic nerve transection the orbital optic nerve (ON) of anesthetized rats is exposed through a supraorbital approach, the meninges severed and all axons in the ON transected by crushing with forceps for 10 seconds, 2 mm from the lamina cribrosa. \n\n\n[0506] Nucleic acid molecules as disclosed herein are tested in this animal model and the results show that these siRNA compounds are useful in treating and/or preventing glaucoma. \n\n\nRat Optic Nerve Crush (ONC) Model: intravitreal siRNA delivery and eye drop delivery \n\n\n[0507] For optic nerve transsection the orbital optic nerve (ON) of anesthetized rats is exposed through a supraorbital approach, the meninges severed and all axons in the ON transected by crushing with forceps for 10 seconds, 2 mm from the lamina cribrosa. \n\n\n[0508] The siRNA compounds are delivered alone or in combination in 5uL volume (lOug/uL) as eye drops. Immediately after optic nerve crush (ONC), 20ug/10ul test siRNA or lOul PBS is administered to one or both eyes of adult Wistar rats and the levels of siRNA taken up into the dissected and snap frozen whole retinae at 5h and Id, and later at 2d, 4d, 7d, 14d and 21d post injection is determined. Similar experiments are performed in order to test activity and efficacy of siRNA administered via eye drops. \n\n\nModel systems of ischemia reperfusion injury following lung transplantation in rats \n\n\n [0509] Lung ischemia/reperfusion injury is achieved in a rat animal model as described in Mizobuchi et al., The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, Vol 23 No. 7 (2004) and in Kazuhiro Yasufuku et al, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol Biol, Vol 25, pp 26-34 (2001). \n\n\n[0510] Specifically, after inducing anesthesia with isofluorane, the trachea is cannulated with a 14-gauge Teflon catheter and the rat is mechanically ventilated with rodent ventilator using 100% oxygen, at a rate of 70 breaths per minute and 2 cm H20 of positive end- respiratory pressure. The left pulmonary artery, veins and main stem bronchus are occluded \n\n with a Castaneda clamp. During the operation, the lung is kept moist with saline and the incision is covered to minimize evaporative losses. The period of ischemia is 60 minutes long. At the end of the ischemic period the clamp is removed and the lung is allowed to ventilate and reperfuse for further 4h, 24h, and 5 d post induction of lung ischemia. At the end of the experiment, the lungs are gently harvested and either frozen for RNA extraction or fixed in glutaraldehyde cocktail for subsequent histological analysis. \n\n\nThe bleomycin animal model as a model for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \n\n\n [0511] Testing feasibility of lung and liver delivery of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated siRNA administered by intravenous injection and intratracheal administration of siRNA- vitaminA-Coatsome complex to a healthy mice and bleomycine-treated mice \n\n\n[0512] Objective: To test two administration routes for feasibility of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated siRNA delivery to normal and fibrotic mouse lungs. The main hypothesis to be tested in the current study is whether systemic administration of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated modified siRNA provides efficient uptake and cell-specific distribution in the fibrotic and normal mouse lungs. Intratracheal route of vitaminA-Coatsome formulated modified siRNA will be tested in parallel. siRNA detection and cell-specific distribution in the lungs and liver will be performed by in situ hybridization (ISH) \n\n\n[0513] Background: The Bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis has been well developed and characterized over the last three decades (Moeller, et al. Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 40:362- 382, 2008; Chua et al, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 33:9-13, 2005). Histological hallmarks, such as intra-alveolar buds, mural incorporation of collagen and obliteration of alveolar space are present in BLM -treated animals similar to IPF patients. Early studies demonstrated that C57/B1 mice were consistently prone to BLM-induced lung fibrosis, whereas Balb/C mice were inheritantly resistant. Depending on the route of administration, different fibrotic pattern develops. Intratracheal instillation of BLM results in bronchiocentric accentuated fibrosis, whereas intravenous or intraperitoneal administration induces subpleural scarring similar to human disease (Chua et al. ibid). A mouse model of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is used. This model shows a heterogenous distribution of fibroproliferation, distributed mainly subpleurally, forming similar lesions to those observed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrsosis (IPF) (Onuma, et al, Tohoku J Exp Med 194: 147-156, 2001 and \n\n\nYamaguchi and Ruoslahti, Nature 336: 244-246, 1988). UIP will be induced by \n\n\nintraperitoneal injection of bleomycin every other day for 7 days for a constant composition of \n\n subpleural fibroproliferation in the mouse lung (Swiderski et al. Am J Pathol 152: 821-828, 1998 and Shimizukawa et al, Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 284: L526-L532, 2003). \n\n\n[0514] As was previously demonstrated, vitamin A-loaded liposomes containing siRNA interact with retinol- binding protein (RBP) and provide efficient delivery to the hepatic stellate cells via RBP receptor (Sato et al. Nat Biotechnol 26:431-442, 2008). This study is planned to test whether vitA-Coatsome-siRNA complex will be efficiently taken up by an RBP receptor-expressing activated myofibroblasts in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. In addition, local administration route (intratracheal instillation) will be tested. \n\n\n[0515] General study design \n\n\nMice - C57 Bl male \n\n\n Starting N (BLM LP.) - 40 (6 for the first pilot group, 34 for the study, taling in consideration anticipated 25% mortality) \n\n\n Starting N (Total) - 60 \n\n\n Test siRNA: SERPINHI compounds disclosed herein. \n\n\nGrou s: \n\n\n \n\n [0516] Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis of 12-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice will be induced by intraperitoneal instillation of bleomycin chlorate: 0.75 mg/kg body weight dissolved in 0.1 ml of saline every other day for 7 days, on days 0, 2, 4, and 6. \n\n\n[0517] Model follow up and monitoring. The mice will be weighed before the BLM treatment, and twice weekly for the period of study duration. \n\n\n[0518] Pilot evaluation of the establishment of fibrosis. The mice (N=30) are subjected to BLM treatment in groups, to allow for a one week time interval between the first treated group (N=5) and the rest of the animals. On day 14, two mice from the first group are sacrificed and the lungs harvested for the fast HE stain and quick histopathological evaluation of fibrosis. When lung fibrosis is confirmed, the remaining rats are sorted into the groups and treated with siR A on Day 14 after the first BLM treatment. In case that no sufficient fibrosis develops in the lungs by day 14, the remaining mice from the first treated group are sacrificed on day 21, followed by quick histopathology evaluation of fibrosis. The rest of the animals are treated with test siRNA complex starting from day 21 after the BLM treatment. \n\n\n[0519] siRNA administration. On day 14 or day 21 after the first BLM administration (TBD during the study, based on pilot evaluation of establishment of fibrosis), the animals are group sorted, according to BW. The animals from groups 1 and 2 are administered \n\n\nintravenously (tail vein injection) with siRNA/vitA/Coatsome complex, at an siRNA concentration of 4.5 mg/kg BW. Intact animals of the same age (Groups 5 and 6) are treated in the same manner. BLM treated animals (Group 9) will be used as vitA-coatsome vehicle control). In 24 hours, the injection is repeated to all the animals, as above. \n\n\n[0520] The BLM animals from the groups 3 and 4, and intact mice from groups 7 and 8 are anesthetized with isoflutrane and subjected to intratracheal instillation of 2.25 mg/kg BW siRNA formulated in vitA- loaded liposomes. Mice from the BLM group 10 are administered with vitA/Coatsome vehicle only. The inttratracheal instillation is repeated after 24 hours. \n\n\n[0521] Study termination. The animals from the groups 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are sacrificed at 2 hours after the second siRNA complex injection or instillation. The animals from the groups 2,4,6,8,10 are sacrificed at 24 hours after the second siRNA complex injection or instillation. \n\n [0522] Upon animals sacrifice, the mice are perfused transcardially with 10% neutral buffered formalin. The lungs are inflated with 0.8-1.0 ml of 10% NBF, and the trachea ligated. The lungs are excised and fixed for 24 h in 10 % NBF. The liver is harvested from each animal and fixed in 10% NBF for 24 h. \n\n\n[0523] Sectioning and evaluation. Consequent sections are prepared from the lungs and livers. First consequent section are stained with hematoxylin and eosin for assessment of lung and liver morphology, second section are stained with Sirius Red (trichrome) to identify collagen The third consequent sections are subjected to in situ hybridization (ISH) for detection of siRNA. \n\n\n[0524] The compounds as described herein are tested in this animal model and the results show that these siRNA compounds are useful in treating and/or preventing ischemia reperfusion injury following lung transplantation. \n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1 \n\n\n List of siR A sequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0525] The contents of the articles, patents, and patent applications, and all other documents and electronically available information mentioned or cited herein, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual publication was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. \n\n\n[0526] Applicants reserve the right to physically incorporate into this application any and all materials and information from any such articles, patents, patent applications, or other physical and electronic documents. \n\n\n[0527] It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that varying substitutions and modifications can be made to the invention disclosed herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to antibodies that bind ferroportin 1 (FPN1) and their use in treating anemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIron is an essential trace element that is required for numerous cellular functions. In mammals, the supply of iron to the body is regulated to match the body's iron requirements at the level of iron absorption by duodenal enterocytes. Iron transport across the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte is thought to be mediated by ferroportin 1 (also known as iron-regulated transporter 1 (IREG-1), metal transporter protein 1 (MTP1) and SLC40A1), hereafter referred to as FPN1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFPN1 is now known to be a receptor for hepcidin, a polypeptide hormone made by the liver in response to iron stores and inflammation. Binding of mature hepcidin to FPN1 leads to the internalization and degradation of FPN1, preventing cellular iron export, and it is a major controlling factor of systemic iron homeostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 7,166,448 discloses, inter alia, nucleotide sequences encoding human FPN1 proteins, human FPN1 proteins having iron transport function, and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated to a peptide consisting of the C-terminal 19 amino acids of the human FPN1. PCT International Patent Application Publication No. WO2009/094551 describes ferroportin Mabs and methods of using them for treating disorders of iron homeostasis. More specifically, WO2009/094551 describes rodent and fully human monoclonal antibodies to various epitopes of human FPN1 proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the involvement of FPN1 in iron transport and the association of FPN1 mutations with diseases of iron homeostasis, there exists a need for therapeutically useful FPN1 antagonists that bind with high affinity to an extracellular epitope of FPN1 and, upon binding, inhibit mature hepcidin-mediated FPN1 internalization, thereby maintaining or enhancing export of iron from intracellular stores. Additionally, targeting FPN1 therapeutically with a Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, with the goal of inhibiting the binding of mature hepcidin to an extracellular epitope of FPN1 must be accomplished precisely enough so that the antibody doesn't significantly perturb the efflux of cellular iron and/or induce internalization upon binding to its target. Additionally, an anti-FPN antibody intended for use in human medical therapy must exhibit sufficient pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, including in vivo stability and/or elimination half life to allow for their therapeutic use. One or more of the anti-human FPN1 antibodies disclosed herein specifically bind human FPN1, including at least one peptide fragment thereof selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n

The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “CDR” as used herein is intended to mean the non-contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. These particular regions have been described by Kabat, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6609-6616 (1977), Kabat, et al., Sequences of protein of immunological interest, (1991), and by Chothia, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and by MacCallum, et al., J. Mol. Biol., 262:732-745 (1996) where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDRs are interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (“FR”). Each light chain variable region (LCVR) and heavy chain variable region (HCVR) is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The three CDRs of the light chain are referred to as “LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3” and the three CDRs of the heavy chain are referred to as “HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3.” The CDRs contain most of the residues which form specific interactions with the antigen. The numbering and positioning of CDR amino acid residues within the LCVR and HCVR regions is in accordance with well-known conventions (e.g., Kabat, (1991) and/or Chothia (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “Kabat numbering” as used herein is recognized in the art and refers to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariable) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain regions of an antibody (Kabat, et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 190:382-93 (1971); Kabat, et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242 (1991)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “monoclonal antibody” (Mab) refers to an antibody that is derived from a single copy or clone including, for example, any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced. Mabs of the present invention preferably exist in a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population. Complete Mabs contain 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains. Monoclonal antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be produced, for example, by recombinant technologies, phage display technologies, synthetic technologies, e.g., CDR-grafting, or combinations of such technologies, or other technologies known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “antigen-binding fragments” of Mabs include, for example, Fab fragments, Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, and single chain Fv fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody”, or grammatical versions thereof, unless indicated otherwise, refers to Mabs, antigen-binding fragments thereof, as well as combinations thereof, including, for example, combinations of Fabs, and combinations of Mabs and Fabs. Additional antibodies exhibiting similar functional properties as the antibodies according to the present invention can be generated by conventional methods. For example, mice can be immunized with, for example, FPN1 expressing cells, FPN1 or fragments thereof, the resulting antibodies can be recovered and purified, and determination of whether they possess binding, pharmacokinetic, and functional properties similar to or the same as the antibodies disclosed herein can be assessed by the methods disclosed in Examples 3-14 herein below. Antigen-binding fragments can also be prepared by conventional methods well-known in the art. Methods for producing and purifying antibodies and antigen-binding fragments are also well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “specifically binds” refers to the ability of an antibody of the present invention to bind to a specified polypeptide or peptide, preferably, \nhuman ferroportin\n 1 consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a specified peptide fragment thereof, with a K\nD \nless than about 1000 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 10 nM, less than about 1 nM, less than about 100 μM, or less than about 10 μM, as determined by affinity ELISA or SPR assays as described herein, for example, or similar assays known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, or alternatively, the phrase “specifically binds” in reference to an antibody of the present invention indicates that the ability of the antibody to bind to or detect \nhuman ferroportin\n 1 consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a peptide fragment thereof, is at least about 5 times greater, at least about 10 times greater, at least about 20 times greater, at least about 50 times greater, at least about 100 times greater, at least about 200 times greater, at least about 500 times greater, or at least about 1000 times greater than its ability to bind to or detect another polypeptide (e.g., heparin) or, optionally, another specified peptide fragment of \nhuman ferroportin\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an isolated polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes a Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof. In particular embodiments, the present invention also provides an isolated polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes i) a heavy chain polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 50, 51, 52, 150, 152, 156, 160, and 164, and/or ii) a light chain polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 53, 54, 55, 151, 154, 158, 162, and 166.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a polynucleotide that encodes a Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof. In particular embodiments, the present invention also provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a polynucleotide that encodes (i) a heavy chain polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 50, 51, 52, 150, 152, 156, 160, and 164, and/or ii) a light chain polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 53, 54, 55, 151, 154, 158, 162, and 166.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen used herein, the term “hepcidin” refers to any form of the hepcidin protein known to be present in mammals. When used herein, the term “mature hepcidin” refers to any mature, bioactive form of the hepcidin protein expressed in mammals. When used herein, the phrase “human hepcidin” refers to any form of the hepcidin protein present in humans. When used herein, the phrase “mature human hepcidin” any mature, bioactive form of the hepcidin protein known to be present in humans. Preferably, “mature human hepcidin” refers to “human hepcidin-25”, a mature form of human hepcidin having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 91.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bioactivity” in reference to mature hepcidin polypeptides such as hepcidin-25 includes, but is not limited to, specific binding of mature hepcidin to its receptor FPN1, one or more FPN1-mediated functions of mature hepcidin, such as a) mature hepcidin-induced internalization and/or degradation of FPN1 (see, e.g., Nemeth, E., et al., Science, 306:2090-2093, (2004)), b) mature hepcidin regulation of FPN1-mediated i) iron efflux, ii) serum iron levels, iii) reticulocyte count, iv) red blood cell count, v) hemoglobin levels, vi) hematocrit, vii) expression levels of hepcidin polypeptides, and/or viii) tissue distribution of hepcidin polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “human engineered antibodies” refers to certain antibodies disclosed herein as well as antibodies that have binding and functional properties according to the invention similar to the antibodies disclosed herein, and that have framework regions that are substantially human or fully human surrounding CDRs derived from a non-human antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, disclosed herein. “Framework region” or “framework sequence” refers to any one of \nframework regions\n 1 to 4. Human engineered antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof encompassed by the present invention include molecules wherein any one or more of \nframework regions\n 1 to 4 is substantially or fully human, i.e., wherein any of the possible combinations of individual substantially or fully \nhuman framework regions\n 1 to 4, is present. For example, this includes molecules in which \nframework region\n 1 and \nframework region\n 2, \nframework region\n 1 and \nframework region\n 3, \n \n \nframework region\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3, etc., are substantially or fully human. Substantially human frameworks are those that have at least about 80% sequence identity to a known human germline framework sequence. Preferably, the substantially human frameworks have at least about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% sequence identity to a known human germline framework sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFully human frameworks are those that are identical to a known human germline framework sequence. Human framework germline sequences can be obtained from ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) via their website http://imgt.cines.fr, or from \nThe Immunoglobulin Facts Book \nby Marie-Paule Lefranc and Gerard Lefranc, Academic Press, 2001, ISBN 012441351. For example, germline light chain frameworks can be selected from the group consisting of: All, A17, A18, A19, A20, A27, A30, L1, L11, L12, L2, L5, L15, L6, L8, O12, O2, and O8, and germline heavy chain framework regions can be selected from the group consisting of: VH2-5, VH2-26, VH2-70, VH3-20, VH3-72, VH1-46, VH3-9, VH3-66, VH3-74, VH4-31, VH1-18, VH1-69, VI-13-7, VH3-11, VH3-15, VH3-21, VH3-23, VH3-30, VH3-48, VH4-39, VH4-59, and VH5-51. Preferably, germline light chain frameworks are selected from the group consisting of O2, O18, and L12, L1 and germline heavy chain framework regions are selected from the group consisting of VH1-69, VH1-18, or VH1-46. More preferably, germline light chain frameworks are selected from the group consisting of O2 and L1, and germline heavy chain frameworks are selected from the group consisting of VH1-69 and VH1-18. Most preferably, the germline light chain framework is O2 and the germline heavy chain framework region is VH1-69.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the human engineered antibodies disclosed herein, human engineered antibodies exhibiting similar functional properties as the antibodies according to the present invention can be generated using several different methods. The antibodies specifically disclosed herein can be used as templates or parent antibodies to prepare additional antibodies. In one approach, the CDRs of a parent antibody are grafted into a human framework that has a high sequence identity with the parent antibody framework. The sequence identity of the new framework will generally be at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% identical to the sequence of the corresponding framework in the parent antibody. This grafting may result in a reduction in binding affinity compared to that of the parent antibody. If this is the case, the framework can be back-mutated to the parent framework at certain positions based on specific criteria disclosed by Queen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 88:2869 (1991). Additional references describing methods useful in humanizing mouse antibodies include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,397; 5,225,539, and 5,693,761; computer programs ABMOD and ENCAD as described in Levitt, J., Mol. Biol. 168:595-620 (1983); and the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones, et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann, et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); and Verhoeyen, et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of residues to consider for back-mutation can be carried out as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an amino acid falls under the following category, the framework amino acid of the human germ-line sequence that is being used (the “acceptor framework”) is replaced by a framework amino acid from a framework of the parent antibody (the “donor framework”):\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the amino acid in the human framework region of the acceptor framework is unusual for human frameworks at that position, whereas the corresponding amino acid in the donor immunoglobulin is typical for human frameworks at that position;\n \n(b) the position of the amino acid is immediately adjacent to one of the CDRs; or\n \n(c) any side chain atom of a framework amino acid is within about 5-6 angstroms (center-to-center) of any atom of a CDR amino acid in a three dimensional immunoglobulin model.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhen each of the amino acids in the human framework region of the acceptor framework and a corresponding amino acid in the donor framework is generally unusual for human frameworks at that position, such amino acid can be replaced by an amino acid typical for human frameworks at that position. This back-mutation criterion enables one to recover the activity of the parent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach to generating human engineered antibodies exhibiting similar functional properties to the antibodies disclosed herein involves randomly mutating amino acids within the grafted CDRs without changing the framework, and screening the resultant molecules for binding affinity and other functional properties that are as good as or better than those of the parent antibodies. Single mutations can also be introduced at each amino acid position within each CDR, followed by assessing the effects of such mutations on binding affinity and other functional properties. Single mutations producing improved properties can be combined to assess their effects in combination with one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a combination of both of the foregoing approaches is possible. After CDR grafting, one can back-mutate specific framework regions in addition to introducing amino acid changes in the CDRs. This methodology is described in Wu, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n294:151-162 (1999). Preferably, amino acid substitution within the frameworks is restricted to one, two, or three positions within any one or more of the light chain and/or heavy chain framework regions disclosed herein (i.e., framework regions shown in \nFIGS. 2-5\n). Preferably, amino acid substitution within the CDRs is restricted to one, two, or three positions within any one or more of the three light chain and/or heavy chain CDRs. Combinations of the various changes described within the framework regions and the CDRs are also contemplated herein. In particular embodiments of this aspect of the invention, all light and heavy chain variable region framework regions of such human engineered Mabs, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, are fully human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 1A and 1B below depict the CDR amino acid sequences and consensus amino acid sequences of preferred antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention.

By the phrase “combination therapy” or “in combination with” it is meant an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention is administered separately, simultaneously, or sequentially with another agent intended to increase serum iron levels, increase hematocrits, increase hemoglobin levels, reducing the need for transfusions, and/or improving the functional status, productivity, and quality of life of anemic patients as compared to the administration of the anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, disclosed herein may be administered in lieu of ESA therapy in patients intolerant or unresponsive to ESA therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “erythropoiesis stimulating agent” or “erythropoiesis stimulator” means a compound that directly or indirectly causes activation of the erythropoietin receptor, for example, by binding to and causing dimerization of the receptor or by stimulating endogenous erythropoietin expression. ESAs include erythropoietin and variants, analogs, or derivatives thereof that bind to and activate erythropoietin receptor; antibodies that bind to erythropoietin receptor and activate the receptor; or peptides that bind to and activate erythropoietin receptor; or small organic chemical compounds, optionally less than about 1000 Daltons in molecular weight, that bind to and activate erythropoietin receptor. ESAs include, but are not limited to, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin delta, epoetin omega, epoetin iota, epoetin zeta, and analogs thereof, pegylated erythropoietin, carbamylated erythropoietin, mimetic peptides (including EMP1/hematide), mimetic antibodies and HIF inhibitors (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0020487). Exemplary ESAs include erythropoietin, darbepoetin, erythropoietin agonist variants, and peptides or antibodies that bind and activate erythropoietin receptor including compounds reported in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0215444 and 2006/0040858 as well as erythropoietin molecules or variants or analogs thereof also known in the art. Erythropoietin includes, but is not limited to, a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 88. The term “epoetin”, includes, but is not limited to, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin delta, epoetin omega, epoetin iota, epoetin gamma, epoetin zeta, and the like. Additionally, an epoetin also includes any of the aforementioned epoetins which are chemically modified, e.g., with one or more water-soluble polymers such as, e.g., polyethylene glycol (including PEG-EPO-beta). Exemplary sequences, manufacture, purification and use of recombinant human erythropoietin are described in a number of patent publications, including, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,703,008 and 4,667,016. Exemplary sequences, manufacture, purification and use of darbepoetin and other erythropoietin analogs are described in a number of patent publications, including Strickland et al., 91/05867, and PCT International Patent Application Publications Nos. WO 95/05465, WO 00/24893, and WO 01/81405. Derivatives of naturally occurring or analog polypeptides include those which have been chemically modified, for example, to attach water soluble polymers (e.g., pegylated), radionuclides, or other diagnostic or targeting or therapeutic moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “erythropoietic activity” means activity to stimulate erythropoiesis as demonstrated in an in vivo assay, for example, the exhypoxic, polycythemic mouse assay (see, e.g., Cotes and Bangham, Nature, 191:1065 (1961)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” refers to that portion of any molecule capable of being recognized by and bound by an antibody at one or more of the antibody's antigen-binding regions. Epitopes often consist of a chemically active surface grouping of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains, and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. The human FPN1 epitopes disclosed herein are presented in the context of the primary amino acid structure of FPN1 (SEQ ID NO: 1). However, some of the epitopes may be discontinuous rather than continuous as the amino acid residues, rather than being in continuous peptide linkage, may be in spatial proximity to each other as a consequence of the tertiary or quaternary structure of FPN1 and their resultant presentation on the surface of this molecule. Preferably, an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention binds human FPN1 consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 at an epitope comprising or consisting essentially of or consisting of an amino acid or amino acids localized to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 9.

Acute events and chronic conditions may be treated and prevented. In an acute event, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is administered at the onset of a symptom, disorder, condition, or disease, and is discontinued when the acute event ends. In contrast, a chronic symptom, disorder, condition, or disease is treated over a more protracted time frame.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment according to the present invention. The terms “disorder”, “condition” and “disease” are used interchangeably herein and include chronic and acute mature hepcidin-promoted disorders, including, but not limited to, anemia including, but not limited to, anemia of chronic disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anemia of chronic disease” refers to any anemia that develops as a result of, for example, extended infection, inflammation, and neoplastic disorders. The anemia which develops is often characterized by a shortened red blood cell life span and sequestration of iron in macrophages, which results in a decrease in the amount of iron available to make new red blood cells. Conditions associated with anemia of chronic disease include, but are not limited to, chronic bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis, rheumatic fever, ulcerative colitis, and neoplastic disorders. Further conditions include other diseases and disorders associated with infection, inflammation, and neoplasms, including, for example, inflammatory infections (e.g., pulmonary abscess, tuberculosis), inflammatory noninfectious disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythrematosus, Crohn's disease, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease), and various cancers, tumors, and malignancies (e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma). Anemia of chronic disease is associated with hypoferremia and reticuloendothelial cell iron sequestration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of hepcidin expression, and hepcidin excess may play a key role in the pathogenesis of anemia in these patients (Weiss, et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 352:1011-1023 (2005); Pigeon. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:7811-7819 (2001); Nicolas, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 110:1037-1044 (2002); Nemeth, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 113:1271-1276 (2004); Nemeth, et al., Blood, 101:2461-2463 (2003); Lee, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 102:1906-1910 (2005)). Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 may regulate hepcidin expression through STAT3 (Wrighting, et al., Blood, 108:3204-3209 (2006); Verga Falzacappa, et al., Blood, 109:353-358 (2007); Pietrangelo et al., Gastroenterology, 132:294-300 (2007)). The data presented herein provide in vivo evidence that anti-FPN1 Mabs of the present invention increase serum iron levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided by the present invention are methods of treating anemia comprising the administration of anti-FPN1 Mabs, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention. In some embodiments, the method of treating anemia comprises the step of administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, to a subject at risk for or exhibiting pathologies as described herein, e.g., anemia disorders, using standard administration techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “effective amount” as used herein refers to an amount necessary (at dosages and for periods of time and for the means of administration) to achieve the desired therapeutic result. An effective amount of the antibody may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, gender, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effect of the antibody, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount is at least the minimal amount, but less than a toxic amount, of an active agent which is necessary to impart therapeutic benefit to a subject. Stated another way, an effective amount or therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the invention is an amount which, in mammals, preferably humans, (i) increases serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit, or (ii) treats a disorder wherein the presence of mature hepcidin causes or contributes to an undesirable pathological effect, or (iii) decreases mature hepcidin bioactivity resulting in a beneficial therapeutic effect in a mammal, preferably a human, including, but not limited to, having anemia including, but not limited to, anemia of chronic disease, including, but not limited to, anemia resulting from infection, inflammation, and/or cancer. An effective amount of an antibody of the invention may be administered in a single dose or in multiple doses. Furthermore, an effective amount of an antibody of the invention may be administered in multiple doses of amounts that would be less than an effective amount if not administered more than once.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known in the medical arts, dosages for any one subject depends upon many factors, including the patient's size, body surface area, age, the particular compound to be administered, gender, time and route of administration, general health, and other drugs being administered concurrently. Dose may further vary depending on the type and severity of the disease. A typical dose can be, for example, in the range of about 1 mg to about 100 mg; preferably, about 2 mg to about 100 mg; more preferably, about 5 mg to about 100 mg; even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 50 mg, even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 25 mg; even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 20 mg; even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 15 mg; however, doses below or above this exemplary range are envisioned, especially considering the aforementioned factors. A daily parenteral dosage regimen can be from about 10 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, preferably, from about 100 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, more preferably, from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, even more preferably, from about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, even more preferably, from about 3 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, or most preferably from about 3 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg. Progress may be monitored by periodic assessment, and the dose adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese suggested amounts of anti-FPN1 antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention can be used as medicaments in human medicine, administered by a variety of routes. Most preferably, such compositions are for parenteral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by methods well known in the art. See, e.g., \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n19\nth \ned. (1995), Gennaro, A., et al., Mack Publishing Co. Accordingly, this invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more antibodies of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. In a particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more other therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, vaginal, or intraperitoneal administration. Parenteral delivery by intravenous infusion or intravenous, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous injection is preferred. Subcutaneous injection is most preferred. Suitable vehicles for such injections are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage in the container provided, including e.g., a sealed vial, syringe or other delivery device, e.g., a pen. Therefore, pharmaceutical compositions may be sterile filtered after making the formulation, or otherwise made microbiologically acceptable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration to a human subject. An antibody of the invention may be administered to a human subject alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent in single or multiple doses. Such pharmaceutical compositions are designed to be appropriate for the selected mode of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carrier, and/or excipients such as dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents including but not limited to sodium chloride, stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate. Said compositions can be designed in accordance with conventional techniques disclosed in, for example, \nRemington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n19\nth \nEdition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1995) which provides a compendium of formulation techniques as are generally known to practitioners. Suitable carriers for pharmaceutical compositions include any material which, when combined with an antibody of the invention, retains the molecule's activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “subject” and “patient” used interchangeably herein, refer to a mammal, preferably, a human. In certain embodiments, the patient has a disorder that would benefit from a decreased level of mature hepcidin, a decrease in mature hepcidin bioactivity, and/or an increase in serum iron level, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of a FPN1 antibody compound alone may be useful in patients intolerant to one or more ESAs, either at any dose or only at high doses, due to, for example, undesirable side effects. A FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention administered alone or in combination with an ESA, may also be useful in ESA-resistant patients who are incapable of reaching their hematocrit goals with ESAs alone, either at conventional or high doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention may also be administered when combination drug therapy, including the use of ESAs, is inadequate in allowing patients to reach their hematocrit goals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of a monoclonal antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention for the manufacture of a medicament for increasing serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit in a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of the monoclonal antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in combination therapy for increasing serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit in a human, wherein said medicament is to be administered in combination with one or more ESAs selected from the group consisting of epoetin alfa, epoietin beta, darbepoetin alfa, hematide, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, or other therapeutic agent or therapeutic treatment conventionally employed to increase serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit in a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following non-limiting examples illustrate various properties of the anti-FPN1 antibodies disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nProduction of Human Hepcidin-25\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman hepcidin-25 can be obtained from commercial sources (e.g., Peptide International (Louisville, Ky.)) or produced by a variety of synthetic or recombinant techniques known in the art. Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the twenty-five amino acids of human hepcidin-25 sequence and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 91 is expressed in \nE. coli\n. Inclusion bodies are isolated from 3 liters of \nE. coli \nexpressing the human hepcidin fusion protein after a 3-6 hour induction with 1 mM IPTG at 37° C. The inclusion bodies are solubilized in buffer A (50 mM Tris and 8 M urea (pH 8.0)). The supernatant is passed over an IMAC column (20 mL resin). The column is washed with buffer A until the absorbance returned to baseline and the bound polypeptides are batch eluted from the column by 0.5 M imidazole in buffer A. The human hepcidin-25 fusion protein is pooled and reduced with 50 mM DTT. This fusion protein is then refolded by diluting pooled material into 2 M urea, 3 mM cysteine, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) to a final protein concentration less than 50 μg/mL. This material is stirred at room temperature and air oxidized for 48 hours. The oxidized polypeptides are passed over an IMAC column (20 mL) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min, and the human hepcidin-25 fusion protein is batch eluted from the column by 0.5 M imidazol in buffer A. The pooled fractions containing the human hepcidin-25 fusion protein are concentrated and passed over a Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare, XK26/60) sizing column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, 4 M urea, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The monomeric fusion protein is pooled and then diluted to 50 mM Tris, 2M urea, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH 8.0 and then is cleaved with enterokinase to produce human hepcidin-25 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Uncleaved human hepcidin-25 fusion protein is removed by passive IMAC chromatography (as outlined above). The flow through from the IMAC column is then passed over a C-18 Reversed Phase column at a flow rate of 4.0 mL/minute. The column is washed with 0.1% TFA in water until the absorbance returned to baseline and the bound polypeptides are eluted from the column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 20% to 40% with 0.1% TFA at a rate of 0.5%/min. Fractions which contain the human hepcidin-25 polypeptide are pooled and analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Polypeptides encoding rat, mouse, and Cynomolgus monkey hepcidin-25 and various N-terminally truncated forms of human hepcidin-25, including hepcidin-22 and hepcidin-20 were obtained commercially (e.g., Peptide International).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nGeneration of 34A9 Fab\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-FPN1 antibodies may be obtained by immunizing mice with an immunogenic peptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 11. More specifically, an immunogenic peptide comprising an OVA epitope linked by a peptide linker to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12, which is thought to be at least part of an extracellular loop of human FPN1, may be used to immunize mice. After immunization, mice spleens are harvested and spleen cells are sorted by Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting using a biotinylated peptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 and streptavidin beads. RNA is isolated from antigen binding cells and converted into cDNA using oligo dT. Antibody heavy and light chain variable regions are obtained by PCR using antibody framework primers and cloned into a phage vector to make a Fab antibody library. The phage antibody library is screened with a biotinylated peptide, e.g., 100 nM, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12. Positively binding clones are then characterized by DNA sequencing, Fabs expression and binding to the immunizing peptide and/or cells expressing human ferroportin. Fab 34A9 was identified following the procedure essentially as described above.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nEpitope Mapping of Anti-FPN1 Mabs\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides containing partial sequences of the FPN1 related immunogen may be used in dot blot hybridization experiments to determine the epitopes of the mouse Mab 34A9.

The membrane is blocked with blocking buffer (e.g., PBS containing 1% BSA), then incubated with 3-5 μg/mL FPN1 antibody in blocking buffer at room temperature for an hour. The membrane is washed three times, 5 min each, with 1×PBST (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) before it is incubated with IR700-labeled-Goat-anti-Mouse antibody according to manufacturer's protocol (LiCor, Inc; Lincoln, Nebr.). The membrane is washed three times, five minutes each, with 1×PBST, is imaged on Odyssey imaging system and Odyssey software (LiCor, Inc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n indicates that Mab 34A9 binds to peptides FpnE3a, 060719Z, 0708L4C, and 0708L4D, all of which contain amino acids 409 to 415 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Mab 34A9 does not require the amino acids sequence of EDI as indicated by the binding to peptide 0708L4D. Mab 34A9 binds more weakly to \npeptide\n 060719Z than 0708L4C; the latter peptide contains amino acids 416-419 of FPN1 (SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nAffinities of Anti-FPN1 Fabs and Mabs as Determined by SPR\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinities of FPN1 binding Fabs and Mabs may be determined on Biacore T100 and using 1:1 binding model in the Biacore T100 evaluation software (BIAcore® AB, Upsala, Sweden). Briefly, the T-REx system, a commercially available tetracycline-regulated expression system without viral transactivators (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) is used for stable cell line generation in T-Rex HEK 293 cells. All growth conditions are described in the T-REx manual provided by Invitrogen. FPN1 is C-terminally fused with GFP. Expression of FPN1-GFP is induced by 1-10 ng/mL doxycycline for 1-24 hours. Induced cells are harvested by scraping off from flasks and then washed with 1×PBS. Cell pellets can be stored at −80° C. before use. About five million induced cells are resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer with 0.2% Tween-20 and protease inhibitors, e.g., Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.). Three cycles of freeze/thaw/sonication are used to lyse the cells. The lysate is diluted two-fold with Biacore running buffer and centrifuged to remove debris.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn Biacore T100, rabbit anti-GFP antibody or goat anti-GFP antibody is immobilized onto \nflow cell\n 1 to 4 of a CMS chip at 5000-15000 Rus. FPN1-GFP is captured onto \n \n \nflow cell\n \n \n 2, 3, or 4 from the lysate of induced cells. Flow \ncell\n 1 is used as reference. Then all flow cells are injected with different concentrations of antibodies to evaluate the binding and kinetics. Surface plasmon resonance based measurements using univalent antigen-binding fragments such as Fabs are generally preferred to those using multivalent antibodies in this assay format to minimize avidity effects.

Ferritin concentration in the Caco-2 cells may be increased by adding an exogenous iron source and the concentration may be further augmented with the addition of hepcidin which prevents iron export. Accordingly, the effect of anti-human FPN1 antibodies on mature hepcidin modulated iron regulation in Caco-2 cells may be determined as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCaco-2 cells are removed from the cell culture vessel using trypsin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The cells are collected and washed in growth medium (e.g., DMEM+10% FBS+1% non-essential amino acids+1% antibiotics/antimycotic) and collected by gentle centrifugation. Cells are resuspended in culture medium and counted. Cell concentration is adjusted to 1×10\n6 \ncells/mL in growth medium and 2.5 μM Fe:NTA (prepared 1:4 molar ratio) is added to the cells. One hundred μl of cells are added to wells of a 96 flat well plate, followed by incubation for 24 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. Mouse IgG\n1\n, a negative control, and two antibodies with different affinities to human FPN1 are prepared in growth medium at 6× the final concentration. Antibody dilutions (25 μL) or medium are added to wells in triplicate. The plates are incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes at which time 25 \nμL\n 5 μM Fe:NTA with or without 600 nM hepcidin (100 nM final concentration) are added to the appropriate wells. The cells are incubated for 24 hours 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nand then washed 3× with 200 μl Dulbecco's PBS and lysed in 50 μL radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100®, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) plus protease inhibitors, e.g., Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.), mixed and frozen at −70° C. until assayed for ferritin using an ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, microtiter plates are coated with 110 μL/well of 1 μg/mL anti-human ferritin (Leinco Technologies, St. Louis, Mo.) and incubated overnight at 4° C. The plates are washed 2 times with wash buffer (0.02 M Tris, 0.15M NaCl, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, pH 7.4) and blocked with 150 μL of 1% casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). The plates are incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. One hundred microliters (μL) of lysates and standards (human liver ferritin, Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, Calif.) are added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates are washed 3 times and bound ferritin is detected using an anti-ferritin-HRP conjugate (Leinco Technologies) at 1:2000 dilution at 100 μL per well and incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates are washed 4 times and 100 μL OPD substrate (5 mg substrate tablet, dissolved in 12.5 mL of 0.1 M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.05 M citric acid, pH 5.0 with 5 μL of 30% H\n2\nO\n2\n) is dispensed to all wells. The reaction is stopped with 100 μL 1 N HCl after 10 minutes. Absorbance at 490 nm (A\n490\n) is read using an appropriate ELISA plate reader. The protein concentration in each sample is also measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To account for possible well-to-well differences in cell number, ferritin concentration data are normalized to protein concentration and the effect of added antibodies is expressed as percent inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperiments conducted as described in this Example indicate that the effects of human hepcidin-25 on ferritin concentration in the cells are inhibited by Mabs 34A9 and 1G9 (Table 6). Furthermore, the results show that the affinity of the anti-FPN1 Mab has direct implications on its functionality. More specifically, the lower affinity Mab 34A9, even at the highest concentration (200 μg/mL) only slightly inhibited mature hepcidin-induced effects (25% inhibition±0.5%), whereas the higher affinity Mab 1G9 exhibited marked inhibition in a dose-dependent matter.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFerritin (ng)/\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSample\n\n\nprotein (μg)\n\n\nSTD\n\n\nInhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNTA:Fe only\n\n\n5.11\n\n\n0.25\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNTA + Fe + hepcidin\n\n\n9.95\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n \nNA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 200 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n9.40\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n11.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 100 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n9.78\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  50 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n10.06\n\n\n0.96\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  25 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12.5 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n10.01\n\n\n1.11\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.25 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n10.45\n\n\n2.05\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 200 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n6.07\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n80.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 100 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n5.68\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n88.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  50 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n7.11\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n58.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12.5 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n7.93\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n41.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.25 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n8.02\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n39.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 200 μg/mL Mab 34A9\n\n\n8.74\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  50 μg/mL Mab 34A9\n\n\n9.65\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis data illustrates that Mabs 1G9 and 34A9 block the ability of human hepcidin-25 to induce internalization and degradation of ferroportin and hence reduce iron exported from the cells.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nAssay for the Inhibition of Human Hepcidin-25 Binding to FPN1\n\n\n \n \n \nStably transfected FPN-GFP/293 cells are plated in poly-D-lysine coated plates at 60,000 cells per well in 80 μL of assay medium (\nDMEM\n 11965, 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 μM FAC, penicillin-streptomycin) and incubated 4 hours at 37° C., 10% CO\n2\n. Doxycycline is added to a final concentration of 11.2 nM to induce FPN1 expression. Doxycycline induced and un-induced control cells are incubated overnight at 37° C. Next, the growth media is discarded and replaced with test antibody or an isotype control antibody in 30 μL of assay medium or 30 μL of assay medium alone control and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. Next, 20 μL of biotinylated mature human hepcidin is added to the wells to a final concentration of 30 nM. The samples are set aside for 1 hour, at 37° C. before washing 4 times with 200 \nμL\n 2% FBS, D-PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Next, 65 μL of lysing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA) are added and the plates are shaken for 10 minutes. Next, 50 μL of the solution in each well is transferred to individual wells of a streptavidin coated plate (60 μL of 2 μg/mL streptavidin in PBS, incubated at 4° C. overnight, washed 2 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS), blocked with casein/PBS), and then incubated for one hour at room temperature. Next, the wells of the plate are washed 3 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS) and 50 μL anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 at 0.5 μg/mL is added and the samples are incubated one hour at room temperature. The anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 is described in PCT International Patent Application Publication WO 2009/058797. Next, the plates are washed three times and 50 μL anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is added at 1:2000 dilution.

Such an assay may be based on mature hepcidin-induced internalization and degradation of its receptor, FPN1. For instance, a HEK 293 stable cell line is prepared that allows for the inducible expression of FPN1. FPN1 is C-terminally fused with GFP for tracking purposes. The inducible expression of the FPN1-GFP molecule is controlled using the T-REx system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The FPN1-GFP coding sequence is cloned into pcDNA4/TO vector, which contains an inducible promoter and a Zeocin resistance marker. The resulting construct is transfected into T-REx-293 cells which expresses the regulatory protein required for doxycycline inducible expression. Zeocin resistant clones are tested for the inducible expression of FPN-GFP. Cell growth conditions are essentially as described in the manufacturer's user manual for the T-REx System (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells are grown in DMEM, 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 μM FAC, plus 5 μg/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Selection is maintained with 100 μg/mL zeocin and 5 μg/mL blasticidin. Cells are plated onto 96-well black/clear plates that are coated with poly-D-lysine. An Acumen Explorer HTS, high resolution fluorescent plate reader is used for reading the total fluorescence per well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing trypsinization, 96-well assay plate is seeded with 9,000 cells/well using the FPN1-GFP/TREx 293 stable cell line. Seeding volume per well is 80 μL. Cells are allowed to attach overnight. Early the next morning, 9 μL of 30 ng/mL doxycyline is added to each well to induce FPN1-GFP expression. After 8 hours of induction at 37° C., the medium is aspirated and the wells are washed carefully with 150 μL/well of PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired treatments (e.g., human hepcidin-25 and/or test antibodies) are set up in a 96-well format for quick addition to an assay plate after washing. Final assay volume per well is 45 μL Immediately after adding the treatments, the assay plate is read using the Acumen Explorer (set at 550 volts in channel 1). This reading is generally the 0 hour reading and is used to normalize for cell number per well, which correlates with the total fluorescence units (FLU) per well. For mature human hepcidin-induced internalization and degradation of FPN1, the maximum effect is seen at 0.5 μM mature human hepcidin. The IC\n50 \nof mature human hepcidin is approximately 10 nM. For anti-FPN1 antibody neutralization assays, the human hepcidin-25 concentration is kept at 120 nM and the anti-FPN1 Mabs were tested at 600 nM, 200 nM, 67 nM, 22 nM, and 7.4 nM. The plates are incubated for 24 hours, after which, they are read again, and the data is generated as the ratio of total FLU per well at 24 hours divided by the total FLU per well at 0 hours. All data points are done in quadruplicate.

Following administration blood samples were collected for analysis of serum iron and serum hepcidin. The dose (30 mg/kg) was administered as an injection via a saphenous vein. Immediately after dose administration, but before the needle was removed from the animal, the dose apparatus was flushed with approximately 2 mL of saline.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConcentration\n\n\nVolume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(mg/mL)\n\n\n(mL/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMurine IgG1 Control\n\n\n9.53\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nMurine 1G9\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n2.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSampling for Serum Hepcidin:\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours post-dose. Blood (approximately 0.5 mL) was collected via a femoral vein into tubes containing no anticoagulant. Blood was allowed to clot under ambient conditions prior to centrifugation to obtain serum. Serum samples were placed on dry ice prior to storage at approximately −70° C.\n\n\n \nSampling for Serum Iron:\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected prior to dosing and at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours post-dose. All blood samples were collected, handled, processed, stored, and analyzed in accordance with methods considered acceptable within the medical community. Serum iron levels may be measured by any method known in the art which is generally considered within the medical community to be an acceptable method of measuring total serum iron (Fe). Serum concentrations of hepcidin were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry essentially as described in Murphy, et al., Blood, 110:1048-54 (2007). Assays for measuring serum iron are well-known in the art (see, for example, Goodwin, J. F., et al., Clinical Chemistry 12: 47-57 (1966), and J. Clin. Path., 24:334-335 (1971)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum hepcidin concentrations were unaffected by the administration of control murine IgG1 and ranged from 1.5 to 31 ng/mL over the time course studied. Average hepcidin levels in the control animals were 11.5±8.8 ng/mL (mean±SD). After administration of murine Mab 1G9, serum hepcidin levels were elevated from a baseline of 7.6 and 14.7 ng/mL to a peak of 49.7 and 79.1 ng/mL, respectively. The peak in serum hepcidin occurred approximately 10 hours after administration of the murine Mab 1G9 (\nFIG. 6\n). The elevation of serum hepcidin is likely due to the interaction of murine Mab 1G9 with its target FPN1, which, upon binding to FPN1 blocks the interaction of FPN1 and hepcidin, thereby slowing FPN1 clearance and/or internalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum iron was not elevated in animals treated with control murine IgG and ranged from 64 to 97 μg/dL over the time frame studied. After administration of murine Mab 1G9, serum iron levels were elevated from a baseline of 136 and 144 μg/dL to a peak of 306 and 292 μg/dL, respectively. The peak in serum iron occurred approximately 48 hrs after administration of murine Mab 1G9 (\nFIG. 7\n). Serum iron levels gradually returned to baseline by 96 hours after administration, indicating that the elevation of serum iron levels is irreversible.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nCell-Based Assay for Anti-FPN1 Antibody Inhibition of Hepcidin-25-Induced Internalization and Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments conducted essentially as described in Example 7 above demonstrate that Mabs Combi-11, 4A10-3, and L2.2-4 inhibit human hepcidin-25 induced internalization and degradation of human FPN1 more effectively in vitro as compared with Mabs 34A9, 3D8, and 1G9 (see Table 10). More specifically, the anti-FPN1 Mabs were tested in a 9-point concentration curve starting at 900 nM and performing 3-fold serial dilutions. The percent (%) inhibition was determined by subtracting the values for 120 nM hepcidin treatment, and then dividing the Mab treated values by the no hepcidin treated value. Relative IC\n50 \nwere determined in Sigma Plot.

For example, in five independent studies Mab 4A10\n−3 \nwas administered to Cynomolgus monkeys as a single intravenous bolus (n=4/group) at doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg. Blood samples (approximately 0.5 mL for iron parameters) were taken prior to the first dose and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 and 264 hours post-dose. At higher dose levels, additional blood samples were taken at 360, 456, 552, and 648 hours post-dose. At the time of dosing, the animals weighed between 2 to 3 kg. Blood samples were collected from each animal via a femoral vein into tubes containing no anticoagulant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum iron concentration-time profiles following intravenous administration of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg Mab 4A10-3 to male Cynomolgus monkeys was associated with a dose dependent increase in serum iron which peaked at 24 hours after dosing. Peak iron responses (approximately 2-fold increase) and duration of response between the mg/kg and 30 mg/kg doses were similar. In the animals administered 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg doses serum iron returned to baseline values about 48 hours after dosing. In the animals administered 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg doses, serum iron returned to baseline values about 72 hours after dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, in a single study, administration of a single subcutaneous injection of Mab 4A10-3 at a dose of 10 mg/kg produced an identical response (n=2; mean±SD) in serum iron, in both intensity and duration, as observed after the equivalent intravenous dose (n=4; mean±SD).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of Humanized Anti-Ferroportin Monoclonal Antibodies in Rats and Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of anti-ferroportin Mabs may be studied in vivo according methods well-known to those skilled in the art. The pharmacokinetics of anti-FPN1 Mabs 4A10-3 and \nCombi\n 11 were investigated after single intravenous doses to male Cynomolgus monkeys and Sprague Dawley rats, for example. At the time of dosing the Cynomolgus monkeys used weighed between 2.2 and 5.5 kg and the Sprague Dawley rats weighed between 240 and 265 g.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic study conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys was performed in three phases, with doses at 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg administered at approximately 2 week intervals. At each phase, either Mab 4A10-3 or Mab Combi11 was administered as a single intravenous bolus (n=4 per group). Blood samples were taken prior to the first dose and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, and 264 hours post-dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn rats, Mab 4A10-3 or \nMab Combi\n 11 was administered as a single intravenous bolus dose of 3 mg/kg (n=3 per group). Serial blood samples were taken prior to dose and at 0.08, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 hours post-dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentrations of Mabs 4A10-3 and \nCombi\n 11 were determined using a human IgG sandwich ELISA format. The standard curve range was 5 to 400 ng/mL, with a working lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) defined as 10 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-compartmental analysis in WinNonlin version 5.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentration-time profiles following intravenous administration to male Cynomolgus monkeys are plotted in \nFIG. 10\n. Mab 4A10-3 was cleared much more slowly (approximately 5-fold) than Mab Combi11 at all doses studied. Differences were apparent at the first time point examined (1 hour) when serum concentrations of Mab Combi11 were approximately 50% of that observed for Mab 4A10-3. At 24 hours post-dose, serum concentrations of Mab 4A10-3 were 20-33% of Cmax compared to only 6-9% for Combi11. Peripheral concentrations of Mab Combi11 were not evident after the 0.3 mg/kg dose. The clearance of Mab 4A10-3 was somewhat faster at the two lower doses compared to the 3 mg/kg dose. The T\n1/2 \nfor Mab 4A10-3 ranged from 2 to 3 days. However, the T\n1/2 \nfor Mab Combi11 ranged from about 12 to about 27 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enhanced clearance of Mab Combi11 relative to Mab 4A10-3 was hypothesized to result from increased non-specific interactions of Mab Combi11 with cell surface proteins which do not occur for Mab 4A10-3. In order to evaluate this hypothesis the pharmacokinetics of Mab 4A10-3 and Mab Combi11 was studied in rats since neither Mab binds effectively to rat ferroportin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentration-time profiles following intravenous administration to male rats are plotted in \nFIG. 11\n. Similar to the observation in primates, Mab 4A10-3 cleared more slowly (approximately 5-fold) than Mab Combi11 in rats (data not shown). Again, differences were apparent at the first time point examined (0.08 hours) when serum concentrations of Mab Combi11 were approximately 50% of that observed for Mab 4A10-3. The T\n1/2 \nfor Mab 4A10-3 and Mab Combi11 was approximately 4.5 days and 3 days, respectively, in rats (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data strongly suggest that the more rapid clearance observed for Mab Combi11 was not attributable to target receptor-mediated clearance since neither Mab 4A10-3 nor Mab Combi11 binds rat ferroportin.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nAnti-Human FPN1 Mabs with Delayed Clearance and/or Low Non-Specific (Heparin) Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic studies of Mab Combi11 described above in Example 11 suggested that Mab Combi11 was more rapidly cleared from serum as compared to Mab 4A10-3. The data also suggested that the more rapid clearance of Mab Combi11 as compared to Mab 4A10-3 was not attributable to increased target receptor-mediated clearance of Mab Combi11 relative to that of Mab 4A10-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause multiple arginine residues had been introduced during the engineering of Mab Combi11, it was suspected that the resulting increase in positive charge of Mab Combi11 as compared with Mab 4A10-3, for example, resulted in increased undesirable non-specific binding to negatively-charged membrane surfaces and to heparin. Indeed, modeling of the structure of Mab Combi11 showed a strong positively-charged patch on the surface of Mab Combi11 which was more pronounced in Mab Combi11 than some of the other human engineered anti-FPN1 Mabs, including Mab 4A10-3 and Mab L2.2-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMabs Combi11, 4A10-3, and L2.2-4 were tested for non-specific heparin binding using a heparin ELISA according to methods known to one skilled in the art. Mabs Combi11, 4A10-3, 3D8, and L2.2-4 were also tested for binding to human FPN1 expressing HEK 293 cells as well as to control HEK 293 cells lacking human FPN1 expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heparin ELISA using Mab Combi-11 showed that Mab Combi11 binds strongly to heparin whereas Mabs 4A10-3 and L2.2-4 did not. Furthermore, Mab Combi-11 also bound strongly to both human FPN1 expressing HEK 293 cells and control HEK 293 cells lacking human FPN1 expressed on the cell surface. On the other hand, Mabs 4A10-3, 3D8, and L2.2-4 significantly bound to human FPN1 expressing HEK 293 cells but not to the control HEK 293 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMab Com11GY was therefore generated to reduce the non-specific binding observed with Mab Combi11 by replacing the arginine amino acid residue in the HCDR2 with a glycine amino acid residue. In addition, another potentially problematic amino acid residue found in Mab Combi11, the tryptophan amino acid residue in the LCDR2, was substituted with a tyrosine amino acid residue in Mab Com11GY. Preliminary binding data, using supernatants from cells expressing Mabs Com11GY, demonstrated a lack of non-specific binding to control HEK 293 cells, i.e., human FPN1 non-expressing cells, whereas both Mabs 1B7 and 1F8 demonstrated significantly more non-specific binding to the same control cells.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nAssay for the Inhibition of Human Hepcidin-25 Binding to FPN1\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman engineered, affinity matured anti-human FPN1 antibodies may be assayed for the ability to inhibit human hepcidin-25 binding to human FPN1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. Briefly, transfected FPN/293 cells are plated in poly-D-lysine coated plates on 96 well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.; BD Biocoat plates #35 4640) at 40,000 cells per well in 80 μL of assay medium (\nDMEM\n 11965, 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 μM FAC, penicillin-streptomycin), centrifuged for 1 minute at 1000 revolutions per minute, and then incubated 4 hours at 37° C., 10% CO\n2\n. FPN1 expression is induced by adding 20 μL of Doxycycline at 10 nM to the plated cells (2 nM final concentration of doxycycline. Doxycyline induced and un-induced control cells are incubated for 5 hours at 37° C., 10% CO\n2\n. Next, the inducing agent is removed by washing the \nplate\n 2× with DMEM. The cells are incubated overnight in 100 μL of assay medium. Next, the assay media is removed and replaced with 40 μL test antibody or an isotype control antibody solution in triplicate and incubated at 37° C., 10% CO\n2 \nfor 20 minutes. Next, 20 μL of biotinylated mature human hepcidin is added to the wells to a final concentration of 30 nM per well. The samples are incubated for 1 hour, at 37° C., 10% 10% CO\n2 \nbefore washing 4 times with 200 \nμL\n 2% FBS, D-PBS (Gibco, catalog no. 14040). Next, 65 μL of lysing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA) are added to all the wells and the plates are shaken for 10 minutes. Next, 50 μL of the solution in each well is transferred to individual wells of a streptavidin coated Greiner microtiter plate (60 μL of 2 μg/mL streptavidin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; catalog no. 54762) in PBS, incubated at 4° C. overnight, washed 2 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS), blocked with casein/PBS), and then incubated for one hour at room temperature. Next, the wells of the plate are washed 3 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS) and 50 μL anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 at 0.5 μg/mL is added and the samples are incubated one hour at room temperature. The anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 is described in PCT International Patent Application Publication WO 2009/058797. Next, the plates are washed three times and 50 μL of goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech catalog no. 2060-05) is added at 1:2000 dilution. After incubating one hour at room temperature, the plate is washed 4× and 50 μL of OPD substrate (Sigma; catalog no. P6912) is added. The reaction is stopped with 100 μL 1 N HCl after 4 minutes. Absorbance at 490 nm (A\n490\n) is read using an appropriate ELISA plate reader. The assay range is determined by subtracting the A\n490 \nof un-induced wells from the induced wells receiving control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data shown in Table 11 demonstrate that humanized Mab 3D8 and affinity matured variants thereof significantly inhibit the ability of human hepcidin-25 to bind human FPN1. More specifically, Mab 3D8, a humanized form of the mouse Mab 1G9, having the human heavy chain framework VH1-69 and light chain framework O2, demonstrated an IC\n50 \nof about 400 nM as determined in this assay format.

As indicated by the EC50 values, some anti-human Mabs are more potent in inhibiting the effect of hepcidin than others, for example, Combi11≅4A10-3>L2-2-4>3D8.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage inhibition (± SEM) by anti-human FPN1 Mabs on mature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhepcidin induced increases in cellular ferritin levels in Caco-2 cells in vitro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nControl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nhuman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentration (M)\n\n\nCombi11\n\n\n4A10-3\n\n\nL2-2-4\n\n\n3D8\n\n\nIgG\n4\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.67E−7M\n\n\n75.2 (7.4)\n\n\n61.9 (6.3)\n\n\n61.7 (3.9)\n\n\n29.8 (6.1)\n\n\n18.7 (3.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.22E−7M\n\n\n69.3 (6.2)\n\n\n59.6 (5.4)\n\n\n53.8 (11.7)\n\n\n25.2 (4.4)\n\n\n24.2 (5.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4E−8M\n\n\n61.1 (5.6)\n\n\n45.6 (5.1)\n\n\n40.6 (10.3)\n\n\n12.0 (5.6)\n\n\n21.1 (4.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.47E−8M\n\n\n45.3 (6.5)\n\n\n36.2 (8.1)\n\n\n30.1 (4.4)\n\n\n 3.4 (4.7)\n\n\n22.1 (3.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.0E−9M\n\n\n31.6 (9.1)\n\n\n28.0 (7.5)\n\n\n39.5 (6.3)\n\n\n14.9 (3.6)\n\n\n16.1 (3.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7E−9M\n\n\n34.8 (5.7)\n\n\n24.9 (7.6)\n\n\n39.6 (7.5)\n\n\n10.6 (10.6)\n\n\n22.4 (3.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.0E−10M\n\n\n23.3 (6.3)\n\n\n19.5 (4.8)\n\n\n24.4 (8.2)\n\n\n 8.6 (6.4)\n\n\n17.5 (3.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0E−10M\n\n\n14.2 (5.6)\n\n\n12.0 (10.6)\n\n\n24.1 (9.8)\n\n\n 7.3 (6.6)\n\n\n15.5 (3.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n 6\n\n\n 6\n\n\n 3\n\n\n 4\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiments (n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n28\n\n\n37\n\n\n193\n\n\n360\n\n\nN.C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.C.: Negative control EC\n50 \ncan not be calculated."
