Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention concerns a novel class of urea derivatives possessing aspartyl protease inhibitory properties. It describes the synthetic methodology used to make these urea derivatives from readily available L-lysine analogues and their biological applications. In addition, this invention relates to different pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention have been shown to inhibit the activity of HIV aspartyl protease, an enzyme essential for virus maturation and infectivity. The inhibitory property may be advantageously used to provide compounds with antiviral properties against HIV viruses, including the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS through infection of specialized cells of the immune system carrying CD4 receptors. The HIV retrovirus reproduces in these cells, especially the so-called T-helper cells, and kills them in the process. While the body has the ability to re-generate T-helper cells to some extent, after years of continuous cell destruction by HIV and fighting back by the immune system, the virus eventually emerges as the battle's winner. The progressive destruction of T-helper cells leads to weakening of the immune system which in turn, opens the door to opportunistic pathogens. When this happens, HTV-infected people start to show clinical symptoms. If left unchecked, HIV infection leads to death in a matter of years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to reproduce in infected cells, HIV needs three major enzymes that are carried inside the viral particle. These three enzymes, reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase, thus represent ideal targets for antiviral therapy. Of these, reverse transcriptase has been the first enzyme targeted by the pharmaceutical industry. Inhibitors of the viral protease have been developed more recently and their use as drugs for AIDS treatment began only in 1996. '\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the development of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors has improved significantly the survival time and quality of life of HIV-infected patients, their use leads to unwanted side effects, such as anemia, neurotoxicity, bone marrow suppression and lipodystrophy. Most of the currently available anti-protease drugs are large molecules with limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. new compounds devoid of these drawbacks are urgently needed to treat HIV infections. In addition, HIV has the ability to develop resistance to the currently available drugs, so new compounds with original structure are desirable to fight these resistant viral strains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO01/68593\n \n describes a class of amino acid derivatives having HIV aspartyl protease inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a novel class of compounds, including their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives. These compounds have an affinity for aspartyl proteases, in particular, HIV aspartyl protease. Therefore, these compounds are useful as inhibitors of such proteases. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the compounds of this invention are capable of inhibiting HIV viral replication in human cells (e. g., CD4+ T-cells), by inhibiting the ability of HIV aspartyl protease to catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds present in viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. These novel compounds can thus serve to reduce the production of infectious virions from acutely and chronically infected cells, and can inhibit the initial or further infection of host cells. Accordingly, these compounds are useful as therapeutic and prophylactic agents to treat or prevent infection by HIV-1 and HIV-2, which may result in asymptomatic infection, AIDS-related complex (ARC), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS-related dementia, or similar diseases of the immune system, and related viruses such as HTLV-I and HTLV-II, and simian immunodeficiency virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is the main objective of this invention to provide a novel class of molecules that are aspartyl protease inhibitors, and particularly, HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a class of \nN\n∈-amino acid substituted L-lysine derivatives (including its lower and higher homologues and analogs) as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives (e.g., salts).\n\n\n \n \n \n

Two different strategies were used to prepared the new urea and thiourea derivatives. The first strategy uses an isocyanate (or thioisocyanate) intermediate obtained from a L-lysine derivative which is further reacted with diverse primary and secondary amines to yield the urea (or thiourea) end products. The second methodology uses a solid phase approach in which a L-lysine derivatives (or lysinol derivative) is transformed into various ureas upon reaction 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (or 1,1'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole) and a suitable amine synthon. The detailed description of these strategies are presented in schemes 1 to 6 discussed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 1 illustrates a generic example for the preparation of a key L-lysine intermediate \nIV\n needed for the synthesis of HIV protease inhibitors according to the first strategy (see schemes 1 and 2, see examples 2 and 18 in the experimental portion of this document).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote:\n\n \n \n \na) For scheme 1, R\n1\n represents a benzenesulfonyl group of formula II as defined above,\n \nb) R\n2\n represents an alkyl side chain as defined above (e.g., i-C\n4\nH\n9\n (\niso\n-butyl), 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, etc.)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 1 can be used for the preparation of \nN\nα-isobutyl-\nN\nα-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)-L-lysine methyl ester \n(IVa)\n and \nN\nα-(4-aminobenzenesulfonyl)-\nN\nα-isobutyl-L-lysine methyl ester \n(IVb).\n It proceeds by using commercially available \nN\nε-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine methyl ester hydrochloride \n(I)\n as the starting material. Reductive alkylation of derivative \nI\n with an appropriate aldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride provided the derivative \nII.\n Then, sulfonation with benzenesulfonyl chloride (or substituted-benzenesulfonyl chloride) in the presence of triethylamine in dichloromethane gave compound \nIII\n in excellent yields for the two first steps. Removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl group (Z group) by hydrogen gas in presence of 10% Pd/C yielded the free \nN\n∈-amino derivative \nIV\n quantitatively.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 2 illustrates a generic example for the preparation of HIV protease inhibitors bearing either a carboxylic function, compound \nVII,\n or an alcohol function, compound \nVIII,\n on the final product. In other words, this scheme shows the synthesis of a L-lysine urea derivative or a (2\nS\n) 2,6-diaminohexanol urea derivative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote:\n\n \n \n \na) For scheme 2, R\n1\n, and R\n2\n are as defined in the first aspect of the invention,\n \nb) R\n3\n represents H, a straight alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a picolyl group (i.e. 2-, 3-, or 4-picolyl), 2-thiophene-CH\n2\n-, 2-thiophene-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, a piperonyl group a phenyl or a benzyl group of formula III as defined above\n \nc) R\n4\n represents a straight alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 6 carbon, a group of formula IIIa as defined above, C\n5\nH\n10\nN-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, OC\n4\nH\n8\nN-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n- (i.e. morpholine-4-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-), C\n5\nH\n4\nN-2-CH\n2\n-(i.e. 2-picolyl), C\n5\nH\n4\nN-3-CH\n2\n- (i.e. 3-picolyl), C\n5\nH\n4\nN-4-CH\n2\n- (i.e. 4-picolyl), 2-thiophene-CH\n2\n-, 2-thiophene-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, piperonyl, 1-indanyl, (\nR\n)-2-hydroxy-1-indanyl, (\nS\n)-2-hydroxy-1-indanyl, indole-3-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n, C\n5\nH\n4\nN-2-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n- (i.e. pyridine-2-ethyl), 1-isoquinolyl, 2-quinolyl, C\n6\nH\n5\nCH(CONH\n2\n), C\n6\nH\n5\nCH(CONH-i-C\n4\nH\n9\n), C\n6\nH\n5\nCH(CONHC\n6\nH\n5\n), 3-indole-CH\n2\nCH(CO\n2\nH), 2-HO-C\n6\nH\n4\nCONH- or C\n5\nH\n4\nN-4-CONH-\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTreatment of derivative \nIV\n with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (or 1,1'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole) provided the intermediate isocyanate (or thioisocyanate) in excellent yields. This intermediate is stable in solution for months. The isocyanate (or thioisocyanate) can be treated with the desired primary or secondary amine to yield derivative \nVI\n in good to excellent yield. The final \nHIV\n protease inhibitors \nVII\n and \nVIII\n are easily obtained from the methyl ester \nVI\n by hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide in a mixture of THF and methanol giving the acid \nVII\n or by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) giving the alcohol \nVIII,\n both in excellent yields. It is noteworthy that, under basic hydrolysis of \nVI\n to produce compound \nVII,\n some racemization may occur. However, it is not the case when compound \nVI\n is reduced with LAH to give derivative \nVIII.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe derivatives \nVII\n (or \nVIII)\n can be further transformed into a variety of amidine or cyanoamidine of formula \nIX\n as shown in scheme 3. These transformations are done under standard reaction conditions. For example, the synthesis of cyanoamidine \nIX\n (Y = NCN) can be achieved upon reaction of \nVII\n with cyanamide in the presence of mercuric acetate for a period of 3 h. The amidine \nIX\n (Y = NH) derivatives is obtained as described above for the cyanamide by replacing cyanamide with ammonia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote:\n\n \n \n \na) For scheme 3, R represents Me or NH\n2\n,\n \nb) Cx represents CO\n2\nH or CH\n2\nOH,\n \nc) R\n3\n and R\n4\n are as defined above or in scheme 2\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 4 illustrates a generic example for the transformation of L-lysine monohydrochloride into a \nN\nα,\nN\nα-disubstituted L-lysine derivatives such as, for example, \nN\nα-isobutyl-Nα-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)-L-lysine hydrochloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote:\n\n \n \n \na) For scheme 4, R\n1\n represents a benzenesulfonyl group of formula II as defined in the first aspect of the invention,\n \nb) R\n2\n represents an alkyl side chain as defined above (e.g., i-C\n4\nH\n9\n (\niso\n-butyl), 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, etc.)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown in scheme 4, the \nN\nα,\nN\nα-disubstituted L-lysine derivative \nXIV\n was obtained from commercially available L-lysine \nX\n in a four-step reaction sequence. This preparation uses the cyclic form of L-lysine in order to manipulate the \nN\nα-amino group without the need for protective groups. First, L-lysine was transformed into L-α-amino-ε-caprolactam \nXI\n upon treatment with hydrochloric acid in methanol followed by neutralization with sodium hydroxide. The caprolactam \nXI\n is also commercially available. Reductive alkylation of derivative \nXI\n with an appropriate aldehyde and NaBH(OAc)\n3\n in dichloroethane led to the \nN\nα-alkylamino-∈-caprolactam \nXII.\n Then, sulfonation with an arylsulfonyl chloride (or a substituted-arylsulfonyl chloride) in the presence of triethylamine in dichloromethane gave compound \nXIII\n in excellent yields. The \nN\nα,\nN\nα-disubstituted L-lysine derivative \nXIV\n was obtained quantitatively by acid hydrolysis of the cyclic amide \nXIII.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 5 and 6 illustrate a second approach for the preparation of an anti-protease derivative using a solid phase methodology in accordance with the present invention. More specifically, scheme 5 presents the method for the synthesis of \nN\nα,\nN\nα-disubstituted-L-lysine derivatives (see example 1) and scheme 6 describes the synthesis of \nN\nα,\nN\nα-disubstituted-L-lysinol derivatives (see example 65). Any suitable solid phase substrate could be used in such preparation (\nK. Burgess, Solid phase organic synthesis, Wiley-Interscience, 2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote:\n\n \n \n \na) For scheme 5, R\n1\n is 4-methylbenzenesulfonyl, R\n2\n is \niso\n-butyl, R\n3\n and R\n4\n are as defined above.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThis process allows the introduction of pharmacophores to a \nN\nα-\nN\nα-disubstituted-L-lysine derivative (such as \nXV\n) via the N-terminal function. Thus, in scheme 5, \nN\nα-isobutyl-\nN\nα-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)-\nN\nε-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-L-lysine \nXV\n is immobilized on a \np\n-benzyloxybenzylalcohol resin (Wang resin) in DMF for a period of 16 h. The resulting component \nXVI\n contained 0.28 meq. of L-lysine derivative / g of resin. At this stage, after removal of the Fmoc protective group under standard reaction conditions (30% piperidine in DMF see \nT.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2000\n), the resin can be reacted with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (or 1,1'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole) to give the intermediate isocyanate (or thioisocyanate) which is further treated with the an amine (or hydrazide) to yield component \nXVII.\n Cleavage of the resin with 95% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n leads to the desired L-lysine derivative \nVII.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote:\n\n \n \n \na) For scheme 6, R\n1\n is 4-aminobenzenesulfonyl, R\n2\n is \niso\n-butyl, R\n3\n and R\n4\n are as defined above.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThis second solid phase approach allows the introduction of pharmacophores to a \nNa,Na-\ndisubstituted-L-lysinol derivative (such as \nXVIII)\n via the \nN\n-terminal function. Initially, (2\nS\n) 2-\nN\n-(4-aminobenzenesulfonyl)-2-\nN\n-isobutyl-6-\nN\n-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-2,6-diaminohexanol \nXVIII\n is immobilised on a trityl chloride resin in DCM for a period of 30 minutes. The resulting component \nIXX\n contained 0.19 meq. of L-lysinol derivative / g of resin. At this stage, after removal of the Fmoc protective group under standard reaction conditions, the resin can be reacted with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (or 1,1'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole) to give the intermediate isocyanate (or thioisocyanate) which is then further treated with the an amine to yield component \nXX.\n Cleavage of the resin with, in this case, 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n for 3 h leads to the desired L-lysinol urea derivative \nVIII\n (i.e. (2\nS\n) 2,6-diaminohexanol urea).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs it can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the above synthetic schemes are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all means by which the compounds described and claimed in this application may be synthesized. Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, the novel compounds of the present invention are excellent ligands for aspartyl proteases, particularly HIV-1 protease. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting late stage events in the replication, i.e. the processing of the viral polyproteins by HIV encoded protease. Compounds according to this invention advantageously inhibit the ability of the HIV-1 virus to infect immortalized human T cells over a period of days, as determined by an assay measuring the amount of extracellular p24 antigen -- a specific marker of viral replication (see, \nMeek et al., Nature, 343, pp. 90-92 (1990\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to their use in the prophylaxis or treatment of HIV or HTLV infection, the compounds according to this invention may also be used as inhibitory or interruptive agents for other viruses which depend on aspartyl proteases, similar to HIV or HTLV aspartyl proteases, for obligatory events in their life cycle. Such compounds inhibit the proteolytic processing of viral polyprotein precursors by inhibiting aspartyl protease. Because aspartyl protease is essential for the production of mature virions, inhibition of that processing effectively blocks the spread of virus by inhibiting the production and reproduction of infectious virions, particularly from acutely and chronically infected cells. The compounds of this invention advantageously inhibit aspartyl proteases, thus blocking the ability of aspartyl proteases to catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment or prevention of HIV, HTLV, and other viruses, which depend on aspartyl proteases for obligatory events in their life cycle. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a virally infected patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of the viral infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infection over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of protease inhibitors in vaccines. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against viral infections, such as HIV infection. As such, the novel protease inhibitors. of this invention can be administered as agents for treating or preventing viral infections, including HIV infection, in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be administered to a healthy or HIV-infected patient either as a single agent or in combination with other antiviral agents which interfere with the replication cycle of HIV. By administering the compounds of this invention with other antiviral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds is potentiated. For instance, the co-administered antiviral agent can be one which targets early events in the viral life cycle, such as attachment to the cell receptor and cell entry, reverse transcription and viral DNA integration into cellular DNA. Antiviral agents targeting such early life cycle events include among others polysulfated polysaccharides, sT4 (soluble CD4) and other compounds which block binding of virus to CD4 receptors on CD4 bearing T-lymphocytes and other CD4(+) cells, or inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the cytoplasmic membrane, and didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) which inhibit reverse transcription. Other anti-retroviral and antiviral drugs may also be co-administered with the compounds of this invention to provide therapeutic treatment for substantially reducing or eliminating viral infectivity and the symptoms associated therewith. Examples of other antiviral agents include ganciclovir, dideoxycytidine, trisodium phosphonoformate, eflornithine, ribavirin, acyclovir, \nalpha\n interferon and trimenotrexate. Additionally, other types of drugs may be used to potentiate the effect of the compounds of this invention, such as viral uncoating inhibitors, inhibitors of Tat or Rev trans-activating proteins, antisense molecules or inhibitors of the viral integrase. These compounds may also be co-administered with other inhibitors of HIV aspartyl protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination therapies according to this invention exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication because each component agent of the combination acts on a different site of HIV replication. The use of such combinations also advantageously reduces the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent that would be required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral agent therapies while not interfering with the anti-retroviral activity of those agents. These combinations reduce the potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity. Preferred combination therapies include the administration of a compound of this invention with AZT, 3TC, ddI, ddC, d4T or other reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other HIV protease inhibitors such as Ro 31-8959 (Saquinavir; Roche), L-735,524 (Indinavir; Merck), AG-1343 (Nelfinavir; Agouron), A-84538 (Ritonavir, Abbott), ABT-378/r (Lopinavir; Abbott), and VX-478 (Amprenavir; Glaxo) to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various viral mutants or members of other HIV quasi species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe prefer administering the compounds of this invention as single agents or in combination with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or other HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors. We believe that the co-administration of the compounds of this invention with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors or HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors may exert a substantial synergistic effect, thereby preventing, substantially reducing, or completely eliminating viral infectivity and its associated symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human \nalpha\n interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon \nalpha,\n diethyldithiocarbamate sodium, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO) antibiotics (e.g., pentamidine isethionate) or vaccines to prevent or combat infection and disease associated with HIV infection, such as AIDS and ARC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention may be comprised of a combination of an aspartyl protease inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough this invention focuses on the use of the compounds disclosed herein for preventing and treating HIV infection, the compounds of this invention can also be used as inhibitory agents for other viruses that depend on similar aspartyl proteases for obligatory events in their life cycle. These viruses include, but are not limited to, retroviruses causing AIDS-like diseases such as simian immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2, HTLV-I and HTLV-II. In addition, the compounds of this invention may also be used to inhibit other aspartyl proteases and, in particular, other human aspartyl proteases including renin and aspartyl proteases that process endothelin precursors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise any of the compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethyleneglycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. We prefer oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. The term \"parenteral\" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are amino acid, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as Ph. Helv. or a similar alcohol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspension and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax, and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable neat formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included in this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 25 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 and about 25 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingredient compound are useful in the prevention and treatment of viral infection, including HIV infection. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained. When the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis, upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the infection, the patient's disposition to the infection and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention are also useful as commercial reagents which effectively bind to aspartyl proteases, particularly HIV aspartyl protease. As commercial reagents, the compounds of this invention, and their derivatives, may be used to block proteolysis of a target peptide by an aspartyl protease, or may be derivatized to bind to a stable resin as a tethered substrate for affinity chromatography applications. These and other uses which characterize commercial aspartyl protease inhibitors will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the description herein, the following abbreviations are used:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbbreviation\n \n \n \nMeaning\n \n \n \n \n \nAc\n \nAcetyl\n \n \n \nAcOH\n \nAcetic acid\n \n \n \nAPCI\n \nAtmospheric pressure chemical ionization\n \n \n \nARC\n \nAIDS-related complex\n \n \n \nAIDS\n \nAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\n \n \n \nAZT\n \n3-Azido-3-deoxythymine (Zidovudine)\n \n \n \ni-Bu\n \n \niso\n-Butyl\n \n \n \nt-Bu\n \n \ntert-Butyl\n \n \n \n \nCAM\n \nCerium ammonium molybdate\n \n \n \nCbz\n \nbenzyloxycarbonyl\n \n \n \nCDI\n \n \nN,N\n-carbonyldiimidazole\n \n \n \nDABCYL\n \n4-[[4'-(dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]benzoic acid\n \n \n \nDCC\n \nDicyclohexylcarbodiimide\n \n \n \nDCE\n \nDichloroethane\n \n \n \nDCM\n \nDichloromethane\n \n \n \nDIEA\n \n \nN,N\n-Diisopropylethylamine\n \n \n \nDMAP\n \n \nN,N\n-dimethylaminopyridine\n \n \n \nDMSO\n \nDimethylsulfoxide\n \n \n \nDMF\n \nDimethylformamide\n \n \n \nDNA\n \nDeoxyribonucleic acid\n \n \n \nEDANS\n \n5-[(2'-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene sulfonic acid\n \n \n \nEtOAc\n \nEthyl acetate\n \n \n \nEtOH\n \nEthyl alcohol\n \n \n \nFmoc\n \n9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl\n \n \n \nFRET\n \nFluorescence resonance energy transfer\n \n \n \ng\n \nGram\n \n \n \nh\n \nhour\n \n \n \nHIV-1, -2\n \nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1, type 2\n \n \n \nHOBt\n \n1-Hydroxybenzotriazole\n \n \n \nHPLC\n \nHigh performance liquid chromatography\n \n \n \nHTLV-I,-II\n \nHuman T-cell lymphotropic virus type I, type II\n \n \n \nIL-2\n \nInterleukin-2\n \n \n \nKg\n \nKilogram\n \n \n \nL\n \nLiter\n \n \n \nLAH\n \nLithium aluminum hydride\n \n \n \nLC-MS\n \nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\n \n \n \nM\n \nMolar\n \n \n \nMeOH\n \nMethyl alcohol\n \n \n \nmg\n \nMilligram\n \n \n \nmp\n \nMelting point\n \n \n \nmin\n \nMinute\n \n \n \nmol\n \nMole\n \n \n \nmL\n \nMilliliter\n \n \n \nmmol\n \nMillimole\n \n \n \nMTT\n \n3-(dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide\n \n \n \nnM\n \nNanomolar\n \n \n \nrEPO\n \nRecombinant erythropoietin\n \n \n \nRNA\n \nRibonucleic acid\n \n \n \n3TC\n \n2',3'-Dideoxy-3-thiacytidine\n \n \n \nTFA\n \nTrifluoroacetic acid\n \n \n \nTHF\n \nTetrahydrofuran\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis section describes the synthesis of several molecules that are presented in this document. These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. This section presents the detailed synthesis of compounds no. 1 to 110 of this invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnalytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out with 0.25 mm silica gel E. Merck 60 F\n254\n plates and eluted with the indicated solvent systems. Preparative chromatography was performed by flash chromatography, using silica gel 60 (EM Science) with the indicated solvent systems and positive air pressure to allow proper rate of elution. Detection of the compounds was carried out by exposing eluted plates (analytical or preparative) to iodine, UV light and/or treating analytical plates with a 2% solution of \np-\nanisaldehyde in ethanol containing 3% sulfuric acid and 1% acetic acid followed by heating. Alternatively, analytical plates can be treated with a 0.3% ninhydrin solution in ethanol containing 3% acetic acid and/or a CAM solution made of 20 g (NH\n4\n)\n6\nMo\n7\nO\n24\n and 8.3 g Ce(SO\n4\n)\n2\n polyhydrate in water (750 mL) containing concentrated sulfuric acid (90 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparative HPLC were perform on a Gilson apparatus equipped with a C18 column, a 215 liquid handler module and 15 mL/min capacity head pumps. The HPLC is operated with a Gilson UniPoint System Software. A solvent gradient was used starting from H\n2\nO/CH\n3\nCN (95%:5%) to 100% CH\n3\nCN over 25 min, and 100% CH\n3\nCN for a further 20 min to clean the column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise indicated, all starting materials were purchased from a commercial source such as Aldrich Co. or Sigma Co.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelting points (mp) were determined on a Büchi 530 melting point apparatus in capillary tubes and were uncorrected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptical rotations ([α]\nD\n \nt\n) were measured using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at 589 nm (the D line of sodium). Specific rotation is calculated from the observed rotation according to the expression: \n \n \n \n \n \nα\n \n \nD\n \n \nt\n \n \n=\n \n100\n \n⁢\n \nα\n \n/\n \n1\n \n•\n \nc\n \n.\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere [α]\nD\n = specific rotation,\n\nα = observed rotation,\n\nc = concentration of the sample in grams per 100 mL of solution,\n\n1= the length of the polarimeter tube in decimeters,\n\nt = temperature (°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMass spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard LC/MSD 1100 system APCI either in negative mode or positive mode.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 equipped with a reversed or QNP probe. Samples were dissolved in deuterochloroform (CDCl\n3\n), deuteroacetone (acetone-d\n6\n) or deuterodimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d\n6\n) for data acquisition using tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm), the coupling constants (\nJ\n) are expressed in hertz (Hz) whereas multiplicities are denoted as s for singlet, d for doublet, dd for doublet of doublets, t for triplet, q for quartet, m for multiplet, and br s for broad singlet.\n\n\n \n\n\nGENERAL PROCEDURES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral procedures for the preparation of urea:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. CDI (thio-CDI) method:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a stirred solution of \nN\nα-isobutyl-\nN\nα-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)-L-lysine methyl ester (see \nIVa,\n example 2, step C) (1mmol) in THF (4 mL) was added 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI, 180 mg, 1.1 mmol (or thio-CDI)) followed by triethylamine (278 µL, 2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h, then amine (commercially available or prepared in one step (see general procedure F)) (1.2-2 mmol) was added in one portion. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature for the primary amine or at 45°C for 15-35 h for the secondary amine. The reaction was diluted with 1N HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate, the organic layer was concentrated and rediluted in THF/MeOH (2 mL/1 mL) and treated with NaOH (IN) (1.2 mmol). The reaction was stirred until complete consumption of the starting material. The reaction mixture was then diluted with diethyl ether (5 mL) and water (5 mL).

General method for the synthesis of secondary amines\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a typical experiment, a primary amine (10 mmol) and an aldehyde (10 mmol) are mixed/melted together and diluted with DCE (30 mL). The resulting solution is treated with sodium triacetoxyborohydride (12 mmol) along with acetic acid (1 mL). The mixture is heated to reflux briefly and left to stand at room temperature for 2 h. Afterwards, the solution is extracted with a 5% aqueous NaOH solution (5 mL, 2x) and the DCE is evaporated. The residue is taken up in EtOH (5 mL) and a 6M hydrochloric solution is added (1-2 mL). A White precipitate is formed which is filtered and dried to give the pure secondary amine hydrochloride salt. They are used as such without further purification and characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN.B. Alternatively, some secondary amines were synthesized simply by heating to reflux benzylamine (or substituted benzylamine) (10 mmol) with a substituted benzylchloride (or other halide such as for example piperonylchloride, 6-chloropiperonylchloride, 2-chloromethylthiophene) (10 mmol) in ethanol for a period of 20 to 24 hours. Afterwards, the mixture was concentrated and treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting hydrochloride salt was filtered, washed with Et\n2\nO and dried. Typical yields are from 30% to 80%. The final products were used as such without further purification and characterization.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific examples for the Preparation of derivatives of general formula I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following compounds were prepared from either from L-lysine or L-lysine derivatives using the procedures summarized in schemes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\n\n \n \nExample 1.

The mixture quickly became clear and homogeneous. The solution was stirred at reflux for 3 h and then at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction flask was left overnight in a refrigerator cooled to - 75 °C. The large crystals obtained were filtered, washed with cold MeOH (100 mL) and dried \nin vacuo\n for 24 h at room temperature. L-lysine methyl ester dihydrochloride - MeOH (275.8 g) was obtained in 99.4% yield.\n\n\n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n): δ 1.36 (m, 1H), 1.45 (m, 1H), 1.58 (m, 2H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 2.74 (br s, 2H), 3.11 (s, 3H), 3.72 (s, 3H), 3.94 (t, \nJ\n = 4.0, 1H), 8.12 (br s, 3H), 8.72 (br s, 3H).\n\n\n \nStep B.

with the infected cell for six days and then the metabolic activity of the cells is monitored by the MTT assay.

Journal of Virological Methods, 20, 309-321, 1988\n)\n\n\n■ We use the laboratory viral strain NL4.3 as wild type virus and the cell line used is MT-4 which is a T-cell line highly sensitive to HIV-1. We also use some WT clinical strains. To address the resistance issue we assay the inhibitors with NL4.3 mutants which are designed to be resistant to specific commercially available inhibitors\n\n\n■ The same MTT assay is used to evaluate the CCIC\n50\n (cell culture IC\n50\n) of our compounds except that the virus is omitted.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2\n presents the anti-viral and the cytotoxic activities of selected compounds illustrating their potential usefulness.\n\n \n \nTable 2\n.
