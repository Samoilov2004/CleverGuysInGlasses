Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group which is useful as a novel sigma receptor ligand, and a therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder containing the compound as an active ingredient. More particularly, it relates to a novel cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group; a pharmaceutical composition for treatment or prevention of symptoms of the disease, containing the compound as an active ingredient; and a method for treatment or prevention of a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder comprising administering the active ingredient.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nSigma receptor ligands are known to play a variety of physiological functions by acting on sigma receptors present in central neural cells, etc. Two subtypes of the sigma receptors are currently known, and, among them, a sigma-1 receptor is known to be mainly accompanied by the central nervous system from studies such as pharmacological studies, ethological studies. Recently, it is known that the sigma-1 receptor is involved in various central nervous system disorders including schizophrenia, dementia, repression, etc. It is expected that a compound having a strong affinity to sigma receptors is useful as a therapeutic agent for treatment of a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder (for example, schizophrenia, dementia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the recent studies, a finding has been obtained that pharmacological effects related to sigma receptors are based on the promotion of regeneration/maturation of the nerve tissue in association with the sigma receptors. In other words, for example, Patent Document 1 suggests that, in cerebral infarction model rats artificially created by ligating the middle cerebral artery to stop the blood flow, sigma receptors are involved in motor function recovery from cranial neuropathy, as well as suggests that compounds showing a strong affinity to sigma receptors may be useful as a therapeutic agent for the central nervous system disorder accompanied by cerebral infarction, cerebral contusion, spinal cord injury, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n It is known that an N-(methyl, ethyl, or propyl)-N-substituted-cyclohexylamine derivative acts as a sigma receptor ligand. As such a compound, for example, N-ethyl-N-(2-phenylethyl)cyclohexylamine derivatives (e.g., N-ethyl-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenylethyl)]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)c cyclohexylamine, etc.) are described in \nPatent Document\n 2. These compounds each have a structure such that a 1-pyrrolidinyl group is bound to an N-substituted cyclohexylamine ring. However, \nPatent Document\n 2 discloses neither a cyclohexylamine derivative having a phenylthio group nor a cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group that has one amine structure bound to a cyclohexyl ring. Moreover, there are not many known compounds that have a high affinity to sigma receptors and promote the regeneration/maturation of the central neural cells as well.\n\n\n \nPRIOR ART DOCUMENTS\n\n\nPatent Documents\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 1: \n \nUS patent application publication No. 2005/0020483\n \n \n\n\nPatent document 2: \n \nUS patent No. 5739158\n \n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nPROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n In view of the current situation described above, the problem of the present invention is to provide a novel cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group which is useful as a novel sigma receptor ligand, and a therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder containing the compound as an active ingredient.

The reaction of step R2 is carried out under stirring in a reaction-inert solvent (e.g., anhydrous diethyl ether, anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, anhydrous 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and anhydrous diglyme) at -70°C to 60°C, preferably at 0 to 50°C, for 2 to 36 hours, preferably 12 to 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds [3] to [7] also can be obtained in the same way, and the compound [4] may be obtained by reacting (3-trifluoromethylphenylthio)acetic acid in place of the compound [I] in the above method; the compound [6] may be obtained by reacting (3,4-dimethoxyphenylthio)acetic acid in place of the compound [I]; and the compound [7] may be obtained by reacting (4-fluorophenylthio)acetic acid in place of the compound [1]. Moreover, in order to obtain the compound [3], decahydroquinoline and the compound of the formula [I] may be reacted in place of the N-ethylcyclohexylamine in the above method. Further, the compound [5] can be obtained by using (3-difluoromethylphenylthio)acetic acid in step R2 for obtaining the compound [4]. However, the compound [5] can also be obtained by separating and purifying the compound [4] and the compound [5] respectively by a silica gel column chromatography after the step of obtaining the compound [4].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n In addition, the compound wherein n is 2 and Z is a sulfur atom can be produced by using (phenylthio) propionic acid or its derivative in place of (phenylthio)acetic acid or its derivative. Similarly, the compound wherein n is 3 to 5 can also be produced by using a butanoic acid derivative, a pentanoic acid derivative, a hexanoic acid derivative, etc. Using N-propylcyclohexylamine and the like in place of N-ethylcyclohexylamine, a corresponding compound of the present invention can be produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds of the present invention, the compound wherein Z is a carbon atom can be produced by using 3-phenylpropionic acid or its derivative in place of (phenylthio) acetic acid or its derivative. For example, as an example of the above compounds [8] to [10] (collectively referred to as compound [A] in the following scheme 2), they can be synthesized by the reaction between N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamine and a 3-phenylpropionic acid derivative [III] (in the formula, R1 represents H, OH or F), followed by reduction. \nScheme\n 2 is shown below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other words, a compound [A] can be obtained by condensing a 3-phenylpropionic acid derivative (formula [III]) with N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamine to give an amide compound (formula [IV]), which is then reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a corresponding compound of the present invention (n is 2) can be produced with use of phenylbutanoic acid or its derivative in place of a 3-phenylpropionic acid derivative. Similarity, the compound wherein n is 3, 4, or 5 can also be produced. Using N-propylcyclohexylamine and the like in place of N-ethylcyclohexylamine, a corresponding compound of the present invention can be produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds of the present invention, the compound wherein Z is an oxygen atom can be produced by using, for example, 1-(2-haloethoxy) benzene or its derivative in place of (phenylthio)acetic acid or its derivative. For example, as examples of the compounds [11] to [12], they can be synthesized by reacting a 1-(2-bromoethoxy)benzene derivative with N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamine or cyclohexylamine and optionally reducing the product while referring to the above-mentioned method. Specifically, such synthesis can be performed with reference to the method described in Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a corresponding compound of the present invention (n is 2) can be produced with use of 1-(2-halopropoxy)benzene or its derivative in place of 1-(2-haloethoxy)benzene or its derivative. Similarly, the compound wherein n is 3, 4, or 5 can also be produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds obtained by the above method can be converted into various salts by the usual method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, there may be optical isomers in the compounds represented by the general formula [1], but all of them should be included in the present invention.\n\n\n \nFormulation method of pharmaceutical composition of the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the present invention contains as an active ingredient at least one of the compound represented by the general formula [1'] and a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, for example, at least one of the compounds [2] to [12] and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, especially at least one of the compounds [2], [3], [5], and [8] and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, and the dosage form to be used for administration includes, for example, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, syrups, suspensions, and injections. These dosage forms can be prepared using a technique frequently used as a usual formulation method, and, the above active ingredients can be formulated into, for example, oral preparations such as tablets, capsules, and granules, using, where necessary, fillers (e.g., lactose, starch, crystalline cellulose, and vegetable oil), lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate and talc), binders (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone), disintegrators (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose calcium), coating agents (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, macrogol, and a silicone resin), gelatin film-forming agents, syrups, suspensions, and injectable purified water solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in the case of capsules, the active ingredient is contained in the dosage unit amount of, for example, 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg i n the form of, for example, a powder, and if necessary, the filler may be incorporated in an amount of, for example, 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. In the case of tablets, the active ingredient in the dosage unit amount of, for example, 0.1 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5mg, or 10 mg, and the filler in an amount of, for example, 20 to 150 mg may be incorporated. In the case of injections, the active ingredient in an amount of, for example, 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg may be incorporated with distilled water.\n\n\n \nAdministration method of pharmaceutical composition of the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be performed orally (for example, administration in the dosage form of tablets, granules, powders, capsules, syrups, or suspensions) or parenterally (for example, administration with injections). These administration methods and dosage forms can be appropriately selected depending on the symptom, age, therapeutic purpose, etc. of a subject to be administered in need of treatment or prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically or preventively effective amount of the active ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is appropriately selected depending on the symptom, age, dosage form, administration route, therapeutic purpose, etc., but, in the case of human adults, it is 0.01 to 100 mg/individual per day and can be increased or decreased depending on the symptom, age, body weight, race, therapeutic purpose, etc. of a patient. The therapeutically or preventively effective amount of the active ingredient is administered once to several times per day. A single unit dose for human adults is administered, for example, preferably in 0.01 to 40 mg/individual, more preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/individual. The therapeutically or preventively effective amount of the active ingredient is an amount effective for nerve regeneration or neuronal protection. Here, it should be understood that the neuronal protection means the treatment or prevention of nerve injury by regeneration/maturation, and preferably promotion thereof, of nerve cells. Thus, optimal concentration should be investigated, for example, in the case of compounds where an effect of promoting regeneration/maturation of neural cells is rather decreased at a high concentration. The amount effective for nerve regeneration or neuronal protection can be known by examining the concentration dependency of the pharmacological effects such as neurite outgrowth-promoting activity. This amount varies depending on the compounds, and the effective amount of the active ingredient can be easily set by those skilled in the art because the concentration dependency of the pharmacological action is proved by an evaluation mentioned below. Further, it is to be mentioned that even compounds with a high affinity to sigma receptors do not always have a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be applied to the treatment or prevention of a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder. The disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder is not particularly limited, but includes typically Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, sequelae of cranial neuropathy due to cerebrovascular disorder, dementia, disease accompanied by cranial neuropathy due to head injury, and disease accompanied by motor dysfunction due to spinal cord injury. A subject that needs the treatment or prevention is usually a human subject, but application to non-human animals that need the treatment or prevention (mammals, for example, non-human primates such as monkey, gorilla, and chimpanzee; small animals (e.g., dog, cat, and mouse) ; livestock (e.g., cow, horse, and sheep)) is also possible.\n\n\n \nExamples\n\n\n \n \n \nHereinafter, the present invention will be further described by way of Examples, but it is not intended to be limited thereto.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of N-(2-phenylthio)ethyl-N-ethylcyclohexylamine hydrochloride\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder an argon atmosphere, (phenylthio) acetic acid (5.05 g (29.7 mmol)), N-ethylcyclohexylamine (1.40 g (11.0 mmol)), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (4.87 g (36.0 mol)) and 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (6.89 g (35.9 mmol)) were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (100 mL), and stirred overnight at room temperature.

The binding rate is represented by the following equation: \n \n \n \n \nB\n \n-\n \nN\n \n \n/\n \n \n \nB\n \n0\n \n \n-\n \nN\n \n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n%\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein B is a binding radioactivity to a membrane preparation in the presence of a test substance, a reference compound or a positive substance and a radioactive ligand; B\n0\n is a binding radioactivity (average value) to a membrane preparation in the absence of a test substance, a reference compound, and a positive substance and only in the presence of a radioactive ligand added; and N is a non-specific binding radioactivity (average value).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe TC\n50\n of the test substance was calculated from a regression equation to the dose-response curve. That is to say, the ratio y= (B - N)/(B\n0\n - N) wherein a value of (B - N) is a specific binding radioactivity in the presence of a test substance, and a value of (B\n0\n - N) is a specific binding radioactivity in the absence of a test substance was first subjected to logit conversion and applied to a logit-log model plotted against the common logarithm of the test substance concentration to create a dose-response curve. In the same way, the IC\n50\n values of the reference compound and the positive substance were determined. The regression equation to the dose-response curve used is as follows: \n \n \nY\n \n=\n \na\n \n⁢\n \nX\n \n+\n \nb\n \n \n \n \n\nwherein Y = logity = ln(y/(1 - y), X = log x, and a and b are each a constant, provided that x is a solute concentration of a test substance.

The results were shown in Table 4.\n\n\n \n2. Evaluation of neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in central neural cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of the rat cerebral cortex neural cells on test substances were evaluated by the following method. The cerebral cortex neural cells were isolated from Wistar rats on the 18th day of pregnancy according to the method of Springer Neuroscience Lab Manual. That is to say, under ether anesthesia, a fetal rat was removed from the uterus of a pregnant rat on day 18, and transferred into a petri dish containing HBSS (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.) on ice. The cerebral cortex was cut out under a stereoscopic microscope. The cerebral cortex that had been cut out was dispersed with a neural cells dispersion solution (manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.) to prepare rat cerebral cortex cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting cerebral cortex cells were subjected to cell culture. Neurobasal medium (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.) supplemented with B27 Supplement (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.; Fin. 2% v/v), L-glutamine (manufactured by IBCO company; Fin. 0.5 mM) and GlutaMax I (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.; Fin. 0.5 mM) was used as the culture medium. The culture conditions were as follows: 5% CO\n2\n, 95% air, 100% humidity, and 37°C. The cells were inoculated to polylysine-coated 8-well slides (manufactured by IWAKI company) so as to have about 2 × 10\n4\n cells/well.\n\nCompound [2], compound [3], compound [4], compound [5], compound [6], compound [7], compound [8], compound [9], compound [10], compound [11], and compound [12] (final concentrations: 0.3 µM and 1.0 µM) were added as respective test substances to the culture solution at about 3 hours after the cell inoculation, and the culture solution with no additives was used as a control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 48 hours after the addition of the compounds, the cells were fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at room temperature for about 30 minutes, and incubated with an anti-α-Tublin antibody (Anti-α-Tubulin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate) recognizing a microtubule protein, at room temperature for one hour. After washing, the nucleus of the whole cell was stained with a nucleic acid-staining agent DAPI. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 20 times. The stained cell image and the nuclear straining image in the same field of vision were imported into a computer as the image. Using an image analysis software (MethaMorph (registered trademark), Molecular Devises), the image imported into the computer was used to measure the \"longest neurite length\" that was the length of the longest neurite of individual cell in each field of vision. A cell having a length of the \"longest neurite length\" of 60 µm or more was defined as a \"neurite forming cell\" and the neurite forming activity was evaluated by the ratio of the \"neurite forming cell\" occupied in the number of the cells in the same field of vision. In other words, evaluation was performed by determining the rate of the neurite forming cells using the following equation: \n \n \nR\n \n⁢\n \na\n \n⁢\n \nt\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \n \n \no\n \n⁢\n \nf\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nn\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nu\n \n⁢\n \nr\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \nt\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nf\n \n⁢\n \no\n \n⁢\n \nr\n \n⁢\n \nm\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \nn\n \n⁢\n \ng\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nc\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \ns\n \n=\n \n \nN\n \n⁢\n \nu\n \n⁢\n \nm\n \n⁢\n \nb\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nr\n \n⁢\n \n \n \no\n \n⁢\n \nf\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nn\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nu\n \n⁢\n \nr\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \nt\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \n \n \nf\n \n⁢\n \no\n \n⁢\n \nr\n \n⁢\n \nm\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \nn\n \n⁢\n \ng\n \n⁢\n \n \n \nc\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \ns\n \n⁢\n \n/\n \nN\n \n⁢\n \nu\n \n⁢\n \nm\n \n⁢\n \nb\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nr\n \n⁢\n \n \n \no\n \n⁢\n \nf\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nt\n \n⁢\n \no\n \n⁢\n \nt\n \n⁢\n \na\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \n \n \nc\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \ns\n \n⁢\n \n \n \ni\n \n⁢\n \nn\n \n⁢\n \n \n \nt\n \n⁢\n \nh\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n \n \n⁢\n \ns\n \n⁢\n \na\n \n⁢\n \nm\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nf\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n⁢\n \nl\n \n⁢\n \nd\n \n⁢\n \n \n \no\n \n⁢\n \nf\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nv\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \ns\n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n⁢\n \no\n \n⁢\n \nn\n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\nThe results were shown in Table 4.
