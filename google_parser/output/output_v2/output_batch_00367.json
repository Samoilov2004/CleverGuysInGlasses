A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable amount of the compound according to \nclaim 1\n and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Description\n\n\n\n\nDOMESTIC PRIORITY CLAIM\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/200,066 filed on Apr. 27, 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I exhibit useful pharmacological activity and accordingly are incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and used in the treatment of patients suffering from certain medical disorders. More especially, the compounds of formula I exhibit Factor Xa inhibitory activity and tryptase inhibitory activity. The present invention is directed to compounds of formula I, compositions containing compounds of formula I, and their use for treating a patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of Factor Xa or an inhibitor of tryptase.\n\n\nFactor Xa is the penultimate enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Both free factor Xa and factor Xa assembled in the prothrombinase complex (Factor Xa, Factor Va, calcium and phospholipid) are inhibited by compounds of formula I. Factor Xa inhibition is obtained by direct complex formation between the inhibitor and the enzyme and is therefore independent of the plasma co-factor antithrombin III. Effective factor Xa inhibition is achieved by administering the compounds either by oral administration, continuous intravenous infusion, bolus intravenous administration or any other parenteral route such that it achieves the desired effect of preventing the factor Xa induced formation of thrombin from prothrombin.\n\n\nAnticoagulant therapy is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of a variety of thrombotic conditions of both the venous and arterial vasculature. In the arterial system, abnormal thrombus formation is primarily associated with arteries of the coronary, cerebral and peripheral vasculature. The diseases associated with thrombotic occlusion of these vessels principally include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina, thromboembolism, acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), transient ischemic attacks, stroke, intermittent claudication and bypass grafting of the coronary (CABG) or peripheral arteries. Chronic anticoagulant therapy may also be beneficial in preventing the vessel luminal narrowing (restenosis) that often occurs following PTCA and CABG, and in the maintenance of vascular access patency in long-term hemodialysis patients. With respect to the venous vasculature, pathologic thrombus formation frequently occurs in the veins of the lower extremities following abdominal, knee and hip surgery (deep vein thrombosis, DVT). DVT further predisposes the patient to a higher risk of pulmonary thromboembolism. A systemic, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) commonly occurs in both vascular systems during septic shock, certain viral infections and cancer. This condition is characterized by a rapid consumption of coagulation factors and their plasma inhibitors resulting in the formation of life-threatening clots throughout the microvasculature of several organ systems. The indications discussed above include some, but not all, of the possible clinical situations where anticoagulant therapy is warranted. Those experienced in this field are well aware of the circumstances requiring either acute or chronic prophylactic anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\nTryptase is stored in mast cell secretory granules and is the major secretory protease of human mast cells. Tryptase has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including degradation of vasodilating and bronchorelaxing neuropeptides (Caughey, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 244:133-137 (1988); Franconi, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 248:947-951 (1988); and Tam, et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 3:27-32 (1990)) and modulation of bronchial responsiveness to histamine (see Sekizawa, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 83:175-179 (1989)). As a result, tryptase inhibitors may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents (K Rice, P. A. Sprengler, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development (1999) 2(5):463-474) particularly in the treatment of chronic asthma (M. Q. Zhang, H. Timmerman, Mediators Inflamm (1997) 112:311-317) and may also be useful in treating or preventing allergic rhinitis (S. J. Wilson et al, Clin. Exp. Allergy (1998) 28:220-227), inflammatory bowel disease (S. C. Bischoffet al, Histopathology (1996) 28:1-13), psoriasis (A. Naukkarinen et al, Arch. Dermatol. Res. (1993) 285:341-346), conjunctivitis (A. A. Irani et al, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. (1990) 86:34-40), atopic dermatitis (A. Jarvikallio et al, Br. J. Dermatol. (1997) 136:871-877), rheumatoid arthritis (L. C Tetlow et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. (1998) 54:549-555), osteoarthritis (M. G. Buckley et al, J. Pathol. (1998) 186:67-74), gouty arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, and diseases of joint cartilage destruction.\n\n\nIn addition, tryptase has been shown to be a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in the pulmonary fibrosis in asthma and interstitial lung diseases (Ruoss et al., J. Clin. Invest. 88:493-499 (1991)). Therefore, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing fibrotic conditions (J. A. Cairns, A. F. Walls, J. Clin. Invest. (1997) 99:1313-1321) for example, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas and hypertrophic scars.\n\n\nAdditionally, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture (M. Jeziorska et al, J. Pathol. (1997) 182:115-122). Tryptase has also been discovered to activate prostromelysin which in turn activates collagenase, thereby initiating the destruction of cartilage and periodontal connective tissue, respectively. Therefore, tryptase inhibitors could be useful in the treatment or prevention of arthritis, periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, and tumor growth (W. J. Beil et al, Exp. Hematol. (1198) 26:158-169). Also, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis (L. B. Schwarz et al, J. Clin. Invest. (1995) 96:2702-2710), multiple sclerosis (M. Steinhoff et al, Nat. Med. (N. Y.) (2000) 6(2):151-158), peptic ulcers and syncytial viral infections.\n\n\nMast cell mediated inflammatory conditions, in particular asthma, are a growing public health concern. Asthma is frequently characterized by progressive development of hyper-responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to both immunospecific allergens and generalized chemical or physical stimuli, which lead to the onset of chronic inflammation. Leukocytes containing IgE receptors, notably mast cells and basophils, are present in the epithelium and underlying smooth muscle tissues of bronchi. These leukocytes initially become activated by binding of specific inhaled antigens to the IgE receptors and then release a number of chemical mediators. For example, degranulation of mast cells leads to the release of proteoglycans, peroxidase, arylsulfatase B, tryptase and chymase, which results in bronchiole constriction.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention is directed to a compound of formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n \n \nZ is a carbon or nitrogen atom;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n is a 4 to 7-membered azaheterocyclyl or a 4 to 7-membered azaheterocyclenyl group;\n\n\n \nis a single or double bond, provided that when Z is a nitrogen atom then \nis a single bond;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n is an aryl group, a monocyclic heteroaryl group, or a bicyclic azaheteroaryl group which includes a first proximal ring that is attached to the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n moiety and a ring distal to said first ring, said distal ring including at least one nitrogen atom;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis hydrogen, —CH\n2\nOR\n12\n, —CH\n2\nSR\n12\n, —CO\n2\nR\n13\n, —C(O)R\n13\n, or —CONR\n13\nR\n13\n;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis hydrogen, alkyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, heteroaralkyl, heteroaralkenyl, heteroaralkynyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, aralkoxy, acyl, aroyl, halo, nitro, cyano, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, aralkoxycarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, heteroarylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, heteroarylsulfinyl, alkylthio, arylthio, heteroarylthio, aralkylthio, heteroaralkylthio, Y\n1\nY\n2\nN—, Y\n1\nY\n2\nN-alkyl-, Y\n1\nY\n2\nNCO— or Y\n1\nY\n2\nNSO\n2\n—;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl, heterocyclenyl, fused arylcycloalkyl, fused heteroarylcycloalkyl, fused arylcycloalkenyl, fused heteroarylcycloalkenyl, fused arylheterocyclyl, fused heteroarylheterocyclyl, fused arylheterocyclenyl, fused heteroarylheterocyclenyl, aryl, fused cycloalkenylaryl, fused cycloalkylaryl, fused heterocyclylaryl, fused heterocyclenylaryl, heteroaryl, fused cycloalkylheteroaryl, fused cycloalkenylheteroaryl, fused heterocyclenylheteroaryl, fused heterocyclylheteroaryl;\n\n\nXa, Xb, Xc are independently selected from hydrogen, R\n4\nR\n5\nN—, (hydroxy)HN—, (alkoxy)HN—, R\n6\nO—, R\n4\nR\n5\nNCO—, R\n4\nR\n5\nNSO\n2\n—, R\n6\nCO—, halo, cyano, nitro, R\n7\n(O)C(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n and when\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n is a bicyclic heteroaryl group, then Xc is a substituent that is at the alpha position with respect to a nitrogen atom of said distal ring of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n and Xc is selected from the group consisting of H, hydroxy and H\n2\nN—, (optionally substituted lower alkyl)HN (hydroxy)HN—, and (alkoxy)HN—;\n\n\nR\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare independently H or optionally substituted lower alkyl, or one of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis H and the other of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis R\n7\n(O)CCH\n2\n— or lower acyl;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis H, optionally substituted lower alkyl, lower acyl or R\n7\n(O)CCH\n2\n—;\n\n\nR\n7 \nis H, optionally substituted lower alkyl, alkoxy or hydroxy;\n\n\nR\n8 \nand R\n9 \ntaken together are ═NR\n10\n;\n\n\nR\n10 \nis hydrogen, R\n11\nO\n2\nC—, R\n11\nO—, HO—, cyano, R\n11\nCO—, HCO—, lower alkyl, nitro, or Y\n1a\nY\n2a\nN—;\n\n\nR\n11 \nis alkyl, aralkyl, or heteroaralkyl;\n\n\nR\n12 \nis hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl(lower alkyl), heteroaryl(lower alkyl), lower acyl, aroyl, or heteraroyl;\n\n\nR\n13 \nis hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n\n\nY\n1 \nand Y\n2 \nare independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and aralkyl, or where the substituent is Y\n1\nY\n2\nN— or Y\n1\nY\n2\nN-alkyl- then one of Y\n1 \nand Y\n2 \nis acyl or aroyl and the other of Y\n1 \nand Y\n2 \nis hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl;\n\n\nY\n1a \nand Y\n2a \nare independently hydrogen or alkyl;\n\n\nn is 1, 2, 3, or 4; or\n\n\na pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, an N-oxide thereof, a hydrate thereof or a solvate thereof.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAs used above, and throughout the description of the invention, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n“Patient” includes both human and other mammals.\n\n\n“Effective amount” is meant to describe an amount of compound of the present invention effective in inhibiting Factor Xa or tryptase and thus producing the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n“Alkyl” means an aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may be straight or branched having about 1 to about 15 carbon atoms in the chain.

A suitably activated coupling partner, such as protected 4-trifluoromethyl-sulfonyloxy-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, prepared by published methods, and compound II are dissolved in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile and treated with an aqueous base such as sodium carbonate and a palladium catalyst such as palladium tetrakistriphenylphosphine at elevated temperature (80-100° C.) for about 0.5 to 2 hours. The protected 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridinyl benzonitrile III so obtained can be processed in a number of ways to obtain compounds of the current invention.\n\n\nThe nitrogen protecting group of compound III (i. e. P) can be removed as appropriate to obtain compound IV; for example if the nitrogen protecting group is a BOC group, III is treated with a mineral acid such as HCl in ethyl acetate to obtain IV as the HCl salt. This material can be reacted with an aryl carboxylic acid such as V in the presence of base and a suitable coupling reagent such as TBTU to obtain Compound VI. Compound VI may then be converted to the benzamidine VII by treatment with Pinner conditions (HCl/ROH, wherein ROH can be methanol or ethanol) followed by ammonolysis in protic solvents such as methanol at ambient temperature to 65° C.\n\n\nAlternatively compound III wherein P is a BOC group can be treated under Pinner conditions followed by ammonolysis to yield compound IX directly. When P is an acid stable protecting group the protecting group may be removed in a separate step immediately following preparation of amidine VIII using methods described above. In either case compound IX is treated with enough base to generate the free amine and aryl carboxylic acid V and a coupling reagent such as TBTU to give compounds VII.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention such as XI can be obtained from the previously described intermediates IX by reduction of the double bond by any one of several reducing reagents such as palladium on carbon under a hydrogen gas atmosphere. Subsequent coupling with aryl carboxylic acid V as described above yields compounds XI. Alternatively compound VII may be reduced as a final step to give compound XI. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain compounds of formula I can exhibit isomerism, for example geometrical isomerism, e.g., E or Z isomerism, and optical isomerism, e.g., R or S configurations. Geometrical isomers include the cis and trans forms of compounds of the invention having alkenyl moieties. Individual geometrical isomers and stereoisomers within formula I, and their mixtures, are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nSuch isomers can be separated from their mixtures, by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example chromatographic techniques and recrystallization techniques, or they are separately prepared from the appropriate isomers of their intermediates, for example by the application or adaptation of methods described herein.\n\n\nIn addition, as illustrated in Scheme 2, an optionally substituted-3-(4-bromophenyl)acrylic acid XII is converted to a suitably activated acid anhydride intermediate, and treated with sodium azide to give compound XIII. This material undergoes a thermally induced Curtius rearrangement, and base catalyzed cyclization to give isoquinolone XIV. Conversion of XIV to the chloride XV, and subsequent lithiation and treatment with trialkyl borate gives compound XVI. A suitably activated coupling partner, such as protected 4-trifluorosulfonyloxy-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine XVII and compound XVI are subjected to standard Suzuki coupling conditions to give the key intermediate XVIII. Compound XVIII can either be deprotected to give compound XIX, or can be subjected to ammonolysis conditions to give compound XXI. Compound XIX can be reacted with an appropriate carboxylic acid derivative, pre-activated with a suitable coupling agent such as TBTU, to give compound XX. Ammonolysis of XX gives one potential final product—compound XXIV. Compound XXIV can be carefully reduced with selective reduction conditions, such as H\n2\n/palladium on carbon, to give final product XXV. Compound XXI (previously obtained from XVIII) can be deprotected to give compound XXII. Compound XXII can either be reduced as described above to give compound XXIII; or alternatively, coupled with the appropriate carboxylic acid to give final product XXIV. Compound XXIII can be coupled with the appropriate carboxylic acid (again, as previously described) to give final product XXV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of Formula I, wherein Z is a nitrogen atom, can be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature, or by methods according to this invention herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nX\na\n, X\nb\n=ring system substituent; R\n3\n=aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl.

The piperazine intermediate compound of formula XXVII can then be isolated using known purification techniques, for example, flash chromatography.\n\n\nThe isolated piperazine intermediate compound of formula XXVII is then reacted with a suitable carboxylic acid compound of formula R\n3\nCOOH in anhydrous dimethylformamide, in the presence of HATU and diisopropylethylamine, at ambient temperature for 18 hours, to afford the desired amide intermediate compound of formula XXVIII.\n\n\nA methanolic solution of an amide intermediate compound of formula XXVIII is cooled to 0° C. and saturated with hydrogen chloride gas. The reaction vessel is sealed and allowed to stand at 0° C. for 18 hours. The reaction mixture is concentrated to dryness under vacuum, redissolved in methanol (20 ml) and cooled to 0° C. The solution is saturated with ammonia gas and the vessel sealed before being allowed to stand at 0° C. for 48 hours. The reaction mixture is then concentrated to dryness under vacuum and the desired compound XXIX is isolated by known purification techniques.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are useful in the form of the free base or acid or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. All forms are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nWhere the compound of the present invention is substituted with a basic moiety, acid addition salts are formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects on Factor Xa inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from the following acids: mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesufonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like. The corresponding acid addition salts comprise the following: hydrohalides, e.g. hydrochloride and hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfamate, acetate, citrate, lactate, tartarate, malonate, oxalate, salicylate, propionate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, methylene-bis-B-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, mesylates, isethionates and di-p-toluoyltartratesmethanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, cyclohexylsulfamate and quinate, respectively.\n\n\nAccording to a further feature of the invention, acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared by reaction of the free base with the appropriate acid, by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, the acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous-alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution.\n\n\nThe acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention can be regenerated from the salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds of the invention can be regenerated from their acid addition salts by treatment with an alkali, e.g. aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution or aqueous ammonia solution.\n\n\nWhere the compound of the invention is substituted with an acidic moiety, base addition salts may be formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free acid form. The bases which can be used to prepare the base addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose cations are non-toxic to the animal organism in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects on Factor Xa inherent in the free acid are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the cations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including for example alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, within the scope of the invention are those derived from the following bases: sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glucamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, diethylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and the like.\n\n\nMetal salts of compounds of the present invention may be obtained by contacting a hydride, hydroxide, carbonate or similar reactive compound of the chosen metal in an aqueous or organic solvent with the free acid form of the compound. The aqueous solvent employed may be water or it may be a mixture of water with an organic solvent, preferably an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, a ketone such as acetone, an aliphatic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or an ester such as ethyl acetate. Such reactions are normally conducted at ambient temperature but they may, if desired, be conducted with heating.\n\n\nAmine salts of compounds of the present invention may be obtained by contacting an amine in an aqueous or organic solvent with the free acid form of the compound. Suitable aqueous solvents include water and mixtures of water with alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, nitriles such as acetonitrile, or ketones such as acetone. Amino acid salts may be similarly prepared.\n\n\nThe base addition salts of the compounds of this invention can be regenerated from the salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds of the invention can be regenerated from their base addition salts by treatment with an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts also include quaternary lower alkyl ammonium salts. The quaternary salts are prepared by the exhaustive alkylation of basic nitrogen atoms in compounds, including nonaromatic and aromatic basic nitrogen atoms, according to the invention, i.e., alkylating the non-bonded pair of electrons of the nitrogen moieties with an alkylating agent such as methylhalide, particularly methyl iodide, or dimethyl sulfate. Quarternarization results in the nitrogen moiety becoming positively charged and having a negative counter ion associated therewith.\n\n\nAs will be self-evident to those skilled in the art, some of the compounds of this invention do not form stable salts. However, acid addition salts are most likely to be formed by compounds of this invention having a nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group and/or wherein the compounds contain an amino group as a substituent. Preferable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are those wherein there is not an acid labile group.\n\n\nAs well as being useful in themselves as active compounds, salts of compounds of the invention are useful for the purposes of purification of the compounds, for example by exploitation of the solubility differences between the salts and the parent compounds, side products and/or starting materials by techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe starting materials and intermediates are prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example methods as described in the Reference Examples or their obvious chemical equivalents, or by methods according to this invention.\n\n\nThe present invention is further exemplified but not limited by the following illustrative examples which illustrate the preparation of the compounds according to the invention.\n\n\nIn the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR) the chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane. Abbreviations have the following significance: s=singlet; d=doublet; t=triplet; m=multiplet; dd=doublet of doublets; ddd=doublet of doublets of doublets; dt=doublet of triplets, b=broad.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n3-{1-[4-(6-Oxo-1,6-dihydropyridine-3-yl)-benzoyl]-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4 yl}benzamidine trifluoroacetate\n\n\nA. 3-Cyanophenyl boronic acid\n\n\n3-Bromobenzonitrile (3.6 g, 20 mmol) in anhydrous THF (100 ml) is treated with triisopropyl borate (13 ml, 56 mmol) followed by 1.6 M butyllithium in hexane (14 ml, 22 mmol) over 15 min. at −78° C.

Both free factor Xa and factor Xa assembled in the prothrombinase complex (Factor Xa, Factor Va, calcium and phospholipid) are inhibited. Factor Xa inhibition is obtained by direct complex formation between the inhibitor and the enzyme and is therefore independent of the plasma co-factor antithrombin III. Effective factor Xa inhibition is achieved by administering the compounds either by oral administration, continuous intravenous infusion, bolus intravenous administration or any other parenteral route such that it achieves the desired effect of preventing the factor Xa induced formation of thrombin from prothrombin.\n\n\nAnticoagulant therapy is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of a variety of thrombotic conditions of both the venous and arterial vasculature. In the arterial system, abnormal thrombus formation is primarily associated with arteries of the coronary, cerebral and peripheral vasculature. The diseases associated with thrombotic occlusion of these vessels principally include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina, thromboembolism, acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), transient ischemic attacks, stroke, intermittent claudication and bypass grafting of the coronary (CABG) or peripheral arteries. Chronic anticoagulant therapy may also be beneficial in preventing the vessel luminal narrowing (restenosis) that often occurs following PTCA and CABG, and in the maintenance of vascular access patency in long-term hemodialysis patients. With respect to the venous vasculature, pathologic thrombus formation frequently occurs in the veins of the lower extremities following abdominal, knee and hip surgery (deep vein thrombosis, DVT). DVT further predisposes the patient to a higher risk of pulmonary thromboembolism. A systemic, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) commonly occurs in both vascular systems during septic shock, certain viral infections and cancer. This condition is characterized by a rapid consumption of coagulation factors and their plasma inhibitors resulting in the formation of life-threatening thrombin throughout the microvasculature of several organ systems. The indications discussed above include some, but not all, of the possible clinical situations where anticoagulant therapy is warranted. Those experienced in this field are well aware of the circumstances requiring either acute or chronic prophylactic anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein may be administered to treat thrombotic complications in a variety of animals such as primates including humans, sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, rats and mice. Inhibition of factor Xa is useful not only in the anticoagulant therapy of individuals having thrombotic conditions but is useful whenever inhibition of blood coagulation is required such as to prevent coagulation of stored whole blood and to prevent coagulation in other biological samples for testing or storage. Thus, any factor Xa inhibitor can be added to or contacted with any medium containing or suspected of containing factor Xa and in which it is desired that blood coagulation be inhibited.\n\n\nIn addition to their use in anticoagulant therapy, factor Xa inhibitors may find utility in the treatment or prevention of other diseases in which the generation of thrombin has been implicated as playing a pathologic role. For example, thrombin has been proposed to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of such chronic and degenerative diseases as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease by virtue of its ability to regulate many different cell types through specific cleavage and activation of a cell surface thrombin receptor. Inhibition of factor Xa will effectively block thrombin generation and therefore neutralize any pathologic effects of thrombin on various cell types.\n\n\nAccordingly, the invention provides a method of inhibiting factor Xa comprising contacting a factor Xa inhibitory amount of a compound of formula I with a composition containing Factor Xa.\n\n\nAccording to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method of inhibiting the formation of thrombin comprising contacting Factor Xa inhibitory amount of a compound of formula I with a composition containing Factor Xa.\n\n\nAccording to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a human or animal patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of Factor Xa, for example conditions as hereinbefore described, which comprises the administration to the patient of an effective amount of compound of formula I or a composition containing a compound of formula I.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I may be used alone or in combination with other diagnostic, cardioprotective agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, anticoagulants, antiplatelet or fibrinolytic agents, selected from: anti-coagulants such as warfarin, heparin or low molecular weight heparin; synthetic pentasaccharides; anti-platelet agents such as aspirin, piroxicam or ticlopidine; direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g. boroarginine derivatives, hirudin or argatroban (Novastan®); fibrinogen receptor antagonists; statins/fibrates; or fibrinolytic agents (thrombolytic agents) such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase (Eminase®), urokinase or streptokinase, Factor Xa inhibitors or Factor VIIa inhibitors; or combinations thereof. Often patients are concurrently treated prior, during and after interventional procedures with agents of these classes either in order to safely perform the interventional procedure or to prevent deleterious effects of thrombus formation.\n\n\nThe term “cardioprotective agents” as used herein, denotes agents that act to protect myocardium during ischemia. These cardioprotective agents include, but are nor limited to, adenosine agonists, β-blockers and Na/H exchange inhibitors. Adendosine agonists include those compounds disclosed in Spada et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,862 and Spada et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,554, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. An example of an adenosine agonists is AMP 579 (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer). An example of a Na/H exchange inhibitor is Cariporide (HOE 642).\n\n\nThe term “anti-coagulant agents” as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit blood coagulation. Such agents include warfarin (Coumadin®) and heparin.\n\n\nThe term “anti-platelet agents” as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit platelet function such as by inhibiting the aggregation, adhesion or granular secretion of platelets. Such agents include the various known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, mefenamate, droxicam, diclofenac, sulfinpyrazone, and piroxicam (Feldane®), including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. Other suitable anti-platelet agents include ticlopidine (Ticlid), thromboxane-A2-receptor antagonists and thromboxane-A2-synthetase inhibitors, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\nThe term “direct thrombin inhibitors” (i.e. Factor IIa inhibitors), as used herein, denotes inhibitors of the serine protease thrombin. By inhibiting thrombin directly, the inhibition of the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin, activation of Factor XIIIa, activation of platelets, and feedback of thrombin to the coagulation cascade to generate more thrombin, occurs. Such direct inhibitors include boroarginine derivatives and boropeptides, hirudin and argatroban (Novastan®), including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. Boroarginine derivatives and boropeptides include N-acetyl and peptide derivatives of boronic acid, such as C-terminal α-aminoboronic acid derivatives of lysine, ornithine, arginine, homoarginine and corresponding isothiouronium analogs thereof. The term hirudin, as used herein, includes suitable derivatives or analogs of hirudin, referred to herein as hirulogs, such as disulfatohirudin.\n\n\nThe term “fibrinolytic agents” (or thrombolytics or fibrinolytics), as used herein, denotes agents that lyse blood clots. Such agents include tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase (Eminase®), urokinase or streptokinase, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is commercially available from Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. The term urokinase, as used herein, is intended to denote both dual and single chain urokinase, the latter also being referred to herein as prourokinase.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with any antihypertensive agent or cholesterol or lipid regulating agent, or concurrently in the treatment of restenosis, atherosclerosis or high blood pressure. Some examples of agents that are useful in combination with a compound according to the invention in the treatment of high blood pressure include compounds of the following classes; beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists and alpha-receptor antagonists. Some examples of agents that are useful in combination with a compound according to the invention in the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels or disregulated lipid levels include compounds known to be HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, compounds of the fibrate class.\n\n\nOther pharmaceutically active agents can be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention depending upon the disease being treated. For example, β-adrenergic agonist compound such as albuterol, terbutaline, formoterol, fenoterol, or prenaline; an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid compound such as beclomethasone, triamcinolone, flurisolide, or dexamethasone; an anticholinergics compound such as ipratropium bromide; and an anti-inflammatory compound such as sodium cromoglycate or nedocromil sodium.\n\n\nIt is understood that the present invention includes combinations of compounds of the present invention with one or more of the aforementioned therapeutic class agents.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the invention to provide kits having a plurality of active ingredients (with or without carrier) which, together, may be effectively utilized for carrying out the novel combination therapies of the invention.\n\n\nIt is another object of the invention to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions which is effective, in and of itself, for utilization in a beneficial combination therapy because it includes a plurality of active ingredients which may be utilized in accordance with the invention.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating a disease associated with factor Xa or tryptase activity in a patient in need of such treatment, said method including the steps of administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I and administering a therapeutically effective amount of one of the aforementioned therapeutic class agents.\n\n\nThe invention also provides kits or single packages combining two or more active ingredients useful in treating a disease associated with factor Xa or tryptase activity. A kit may provide (alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier), the compound of formula I and one of the aforementioned therapeutic class agents (alone or in combination with diluent or carrier).\n\n\nThe present invention also includes within its scope pharmaceutical formulations which comprise at least one of the compounds of Formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or coating.\n\n\nIn practice, compounds of the present invention may generally be administered parenterally, intravenously, subcutaneously intramuscularly, colonically, nasally, intraperitoneally, rectally or orally.\n\n\nThe products according to the invention may be presented in forms permitting administration by the most suitable route and the invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one product according to the invention which are suitable for use in human or veterinary medicine. These compositions may be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants or excipients. The adjuvants comprise, inter alia, diluents, sterile aqueous media and the various non-toxic organic solvents. The compositions may be presented in the form of tablets, pills, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs or syrups, and can contain one or more agents chosen from the group comprising sweeteners, flavorings, colorings, or stabilizers in order to obtain pharmaceutically acceptable preparations.\n\n\nThe choice of vehicle and the content of active substance in the vehicle are generally determined in accordance with the solubility and chemical properties of the product, the particular mode of administration and the provisions to be observed in pharmaceutical practice. For example, excipients such as lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acids and certain complex silicates combined with lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc may be used for preparing tablets. To prepare a capsule, it is advantageous to use lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are used they can contain emulsifying agents or agents which facilitate suspension. Diluents such as sucrose, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol and chloroform or mixtures thereof may also be used.\n\n\nFor parenteral administration, emulsions, suspensions or solutions of the products according to the invention in vegetable oil, for example sesame oil, groundnut oil or olive oil, or aqueous-organic solutions such as water and propylene glycol, injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are used. The solutions of the salts of the products according to the invention are especially useful for administration by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The aqueous solutions, also comprising solutions of the salts in pure distilled water, may be used for intravenous administration with the proviso that their pH is suitably adjusted, that they are judiciously buffered and rendered isotonic with a sufficient quantity of glucose or sodium chloride and that they are sterilized by heating, irradiation or microfiltration.\n\n\nSuitable compositions containing the compounds of the invention may be prepared by conventional means. For example, compounds of the invention may be dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier for use in a nebulizer or a suspension or solution aerosol, or may be absorbed or adsorbed onto a suitable solid carrier for use in a dry powder inhaler.\n\n\nSolid compositions for rectal administration include suppositories formulated in accordance with known methods and containing at least one compound of formula I.\n\n\nThe percentage of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied, it being necessary that it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. The dose employed will be determined by the physician, and depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment, and the condition of the patient. In the adult, the doses are generally from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably about 0.01 to about 10, mg/kg body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably 0.1 to 70, more especially 0.5 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.01 to about 50, preferably 0.01 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration. In each particular case, the doses will be determined in accordance with the factors distinctive to the subject to be treated, such as age, weight, general state of health and other characteristics which can influence the efficacy of the medicinal product.\n\n\nThe products according to the invention may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate. For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient. Generally, the active product may be administered orally 1 to 4 times per day. It goes without saying that, for other patients, it will be necessary to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may also be formulated for use in conjunction with other therapeutic agents such as agents or in connection with the application of therapeutic techniques to address pharmacological conditions which may be ameliorated through the application of a compound of formula I, as described herein.\n\n\nCompounds within the scope of the present invention exhibit marked pharmacological activities according to tests described in the literature and below which tests results are believed to correlate to pharmacological activity in humans and other mammals.\n\n\nEnzyme Assays:\n\n\nThe ability of the compounds in the present invention to act as inhibitors of factor Xa, thrombin, trypsin, tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase-plasminogen activator (u-PA), plasmin and activated protein C is evaluated by determining the concentration of inhibitor which resulted in a 50% loss in enzyme activity (IC50) using purified enzymes.\n\n\nAll enzyme assays are carried out at room temperature in 96-well microtiter plates using a final enzyme concentration of 1 nM. The concentrations of factor Xa and thrombin are determined by active site titration and the concentrations of all other enzymes are based on the protein concentration supplied by the manufacturer. Compounds according to the invention are dissolved in DMSO, diluted with their respective buffers and assayed at a maximal final DMSO concentration of 1.25%. Compound dilutions are added to wells containing buffer and enzyme and pre-equilibrated for between 5 and 30 minutes. The enzyme reactions are initiated by the addition of substrate and the color developed from the hydrolysis of the peptide-p-nitroanilide substrates is monitored continuously for 5 minutes at 405 nm on a Vmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Under these conditions, less than 10% of the substrate is utilized in all assays. The initial velocities measured are used to calculate the amount of inhibitor which resulted in a 50% reduction of the control velocity (IC50). The apparent Ki values are then determined according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (IC50=Ki[1+[S]/Km]) assuming competitive inhibition kinetics. Ki values for particular examples of compounds of the present invention with respect to Factor Xa, as well as Ki values for particular examples of compounds of the present invention with respect to tryptase, are set forth in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE #\n\n\nNAME\n\n\nFactor Xa Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n3-[1-(4-Pyridin-3-yl-benzoyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nyl]benzamidine ditrifluoroacetate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n3-{1-[4-(5-Bromofuran-2-yl)-benzoyl]-1,2,3,6-\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntetrahydropyridin-4-yl}benzamidine trifluoroacetate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n3-{1-[4-(5-Chlorothiophen-2-yl)-benzoyl]-1,2,3,6-\n\n\n688\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntetrahydropyridin-4-yl}benzamidine trifluoroacetate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n3[1-(4-Pyrimidin-2-ylbenzoyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nyl]-benzamidine ditrifluoroacetate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n3-[1-(4-Pyridin-2-ylbenzoyl)-piperidin-4-yl]benzamidine\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nditrifluoroacetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n4′-[4-(1-Aminoisoquinolin-7-yl)piperidine-1-\n\n\n570\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncarbonyl]biphenyl-3-carboxylic acid amide trifluoroacetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n5-{4-[4-(1-Aminoisoquinolin-7-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-\n\n\n140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-carbonyl]phenyl}-1H-pyridin-2-one trifluoroacetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n5-{4-[4-(4-Amino-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl)piperidine-\n\n\n990\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1-carbonyl]phenyl}-1H-pyridin-2-one trifluoroacetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE #\n\n\nNAME\n\n\nTryptase Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n3-[1-(5-Phenylethynyl-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-1,2,3,6-\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-benzamidine hydrochloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n3-[4-(5-Phenylethyl-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-\n\n\n1,070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbenzamidine di-hydrochloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional in vitro assay may be used to evaluate the potency of compounds according to the invention in normal human plasma. The activated partial thromboplastin time is a plasma-based clotting assay that relies on the in situ generation of factor Xa, its assembly into the prothrombinase complex and the subsequent generation of thrombin and fibrin which ultimately yields the formation of a clot as the assay endpoint. This assay is currently used clinically to monitor the ex vivo effects of the commonly used anticoagulant drug heparin as well as direct acting antithrombin agents undergoing clinical evaluation. Therefore, activity in this in vitro assay is considered as a surrogate marker for in vivo anticoagulant activity.\n\n\nHuman Plasma Based Clotting Assay:\n\n\nActivated partial thromboplastin clotting times are determined in duplicate on a MLA Electra 800 instrument. A volume of 100 μl of citrated normal human pooled plasma (George King Biomedical) is added to a cuvette containing 100 μl of a compound according to the invention in Tris/NaCl buffer (pH 7.5) and placed in the instrument. Following a 3 minute warming period instrument automatically adds 100 μl of activated cephaloplastin reagent (Actin, Dade) followed by 100 μl of 0.035 M CaCl\n2 \nto initiate the clotting reaction. Clot formation is determined spectrophotometrically and measured in seconds. Compound potency is quantitated as the concentration required to double a control clotting time measured with human plasma in the absence of the compound according to the invention.\n\n\nCompounds according to the invention may also be evaluated for their in vivo antithrombotic efficacy in two well established animal experimental models of acute vascular thrombosis. A rabbit model of jugular vein thrombosis and a rat model of carotid artery thrombosis are used to demonstrate the antithrombotic activity of these compounds in distinct animal model paradigms of human venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, respectively.\n\n\nExperimental In Vivo Rabbit Venous Thrombosis Model:\n\n\nThis is a well characterized model of fibrin rich venous thrombosis that is validated in the literature and shown to be sensitive to several anticoagulant drugs including heparin (Antithrombotic Effect of Recombinant Truncated Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI 1-161) in Experimental Venous Thrombosis-a Comparison with Low Molecular Weight Heparin, J. Holst, B. Lindblad, D. Bergqvist, O. Nordfang, P. B. Ostergaard, J. G. L. Petersen, G. Nielsen and U. Hedner. \nThrombosis and Haemostasis\n, 71, 214-219 (1994). The purpose of utilizing this model is to evaluate the ability of compounds to prevent the formation of venous thrombi (clots) in vivo generated at a site of injury and partial stasis in the jugular vein.\n\n\nMale and female New Zealand white rabbits weighing 1.5-2 kg are anesthetized with 35 mg/kg of ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine in a volume of 1 mL/kg (i.m.). The right jugular vein is cannulated for infusion of anesthetic (ketamine/xylazine 17/2.5 mg/kg/hr at a rate of approximately 0.5 mL/hr) and administration of test substances. The right carotid artery is cannulated for recording arterial blood pressure and collecting blood samples. Body temperature is maintained at 39° C. with a GAYMAR T-PUMP. The left external jugular vein is isolated and all side branches along an exposed 2-3 cm of vessel are tied off. The internal jugular vein is cannulated, just above the bifurcation of the common jugular, and the tip of the cannula is advanced just proximal to the common jugular vein. A 1 cm segment of the vein is isolated with non-traumatic vascular clamps and a relative stenosis is formed by tying a ligature around the vein with an 18 G needle just below the distal most clamp. This creates a region of reduced flow and partial stasis at the injury site. The isolated segment is gently rinsed with saline 2-3 times via the cannula in the internal jugular. Thereafter the isolated segment is filled with 0.5 mL of 0.5% polyoxyethylene ether (W-1) for 5 minutes. W-1 is a detergent which disrupts the endothelial cell lining of the segment, thus providing a thrombogenic surface for initiating clot formation. After 5 minutes the W-1 is withdrawn from the segment, and the segment is again gently rinsed with saline 2-3 times. The vascular clamps are then removed, restoring blood flow through this portion of the vessel. Clot formation is allowed to form and grow for 30 minutes after which the vein is cut just below the stenotic ligature and inspected for blood flow (the absence of blood flow is recorded as complete occlusion). The entire isolated segment of vein is then ligated and the formed clot is removed and weighed (wet weight). The effect of test agents on final clot weights is used as the primary end point. Animals are maintained for an additional thirty minutes to obtain a final pharmacodynamic measure of anticoagulation. Drug administration is initiated 15 minutes prior to vascular injury with W-1 and continued through the period of clot formation and maturation. Three blood samples (3 mL ea.) are obtained for evaluation of hemostatic parameters: one just prior to administration of W-1; a second 30 minutes after removal of the vascular clamps and a third at the termination of the experiment. Antithrombotic efficacy is expressed as a reduction in the final clot weight in preparations treated with a compound according to the invention relative to vehicle treated control animals.\n\n\nExperimental In Vivo Rat Arterial Thrombosis Model:\n\n\nThe antithrombotic efficacy of factor Xa inhibitors against platelet-rich arterial thrombosis may be evaluated using a well characterized rat carotid artery FeCl\n2\n-induced thrombosis model (Superior Activity of a Thromboxane Receptor Antagonist as Compared with Aspirin in Rat Models of Arterial and Venous Thrombosis, W.

This model is widely used to evaluate the antithrombotic potential of a variety of agents including heparin and the direct acting thrombin inhibitors.\n\n\nSprague Dawley rats weighing 375-450 g are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.). Upon reaching an acceptable level of anesthesia, the ventral surface of the neck is shaved and prepared for aseptic surgery. Electrocardiogram electrodes are connected and lead II is monitored throughout the experiment. The right femoral vein and artery are cannulated with PE-50 tubing for administration of a compound according to the invention and for obtaining blood samples and monitoring blood pressure, respectively. A midline incision is made in the ventral surface of the neck. The trachea is exposed and intubated with PE-240 tubing to ensure airway patency. The right carotid artery is isolated and two 4-0 silk sutures are placed around the vessel to facilitate instrumentation. An electromagnetic flow probe (0.95-1.0 mm lumen) is placed around the vessel to measure blood flow. Distal to the probe a 4×4 mm strip of parafilm is placed under the vessel to isolate it from the surrounding muscle bed. After baseline flow measurements are made, a 2×5 mm strip of filter paper previously saturated in 35% FeCl\n2 \nis placed on top of the vessel downstream from the probe for ten minutes and then removed. The FeCl\n2 \nis thought to diffuse into the underlying segment of artery and cause deendothelialization resulting in acute thrombus formation. Following application of the FeCl\n2\n-soaked filter paper, blood pressure, carotid artery blood flow and heart rate are monitored for an observation period of 60 minutes. Following occlusion of the vessel (defined as the attainment of zero blood flow), or 60 minutes after filter paper application if patency is maintained, the artery is ligated proximal and distal to the area of injury and the vessel is excised. The thrombus is removed and weighed immediately and recorded as the primary end point of the study.\n\n\nFollowing surgical instrumentation a control blood sample (B1) is drawn. All blood samples are collected from the arterial catheter and mixed with sodium citrate to prevent clotting. After each blood sample, the catheter is flushed with 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline. A compound according to the invention is administered intravenously (i.v.) starting 5 minutes prior to FeCl\n2 \napplication. The time between FeCl\n2 \napplication and the time at which carotid blood flow reached zero is recorded as time to occlusion (TTO). For vessels that did not occlude within 60 minutes, TTO is assigned a value of 60 minutes. Five minutes after application of FeCl\n2\n, a second blood sample is drawn (B2). After 10 minutes of FeCl\n2 \nexposure, the filter paper is removed from the vessel and the animal is monitored for the remainder of the experiment. Upon reaching zero blood flow blood a third blood sample is drawn (B3) and the clot is removed and weighed. Template bleeding time measurements are performed on the forelimb toe pads at the same time that blood samples are obtained. Coagulation profiles consisting of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) are performed on all blood samples. In some instances a compound according to the invention may be administered orally. Rats are restrained manually using standard techniques and compounds are administered by intragastric gavage using a 18 gauge curved dosing needle (volume of 5 mL/kg). Fifteen minutes after intragastric dosing, the animal is anesthetized and instrumented as described previously. Experiments are then performed according to the protocol described above. By way of example, Compound 184 shows K\ni \nvalues of 27.0 nM, 1.72 μM, and 2.71 μM, in the Factor Xa, trypsin, and thrombin assays, respectively. Compound 45 shows K\ni \nvalues of 94.0 nM, 129 nM, and 477 nM, in the Factor Xa, trypsin, and thrombin assays, respectively. Compound 167 shows K\ni \nvalues of 19.0 nM, 46 nM, and 1.228 μM, in the Factor Xa, trypsin, and thrombin assays, respectively.\n\n\nTryptase Inhibition Activity:\n\n\nTryptase inhibition activity is confirmed using either isolated human lung tryptase or recombinant human β tryptase expressed in yeast cells. Essentially equivalent results are obtained using isolated native enzyme or the expressed enzyme. The assay procedure employes a 96 well microplate (Costar 3590) using L-pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-para-nitroanilide (S2366: Quadratech) as substrate (essentially as described by McEuen et. al. Biochem Pharm, 52, pp 331-340, 1996). Assays are performed at room temperature using 0.5 mM substrate (2×K\nm\n) and the microplate is read on a microplate reader (Beckman Biomek Plate reader) at 405 nm wavelength. To determine the compound concentration that inhibites half of the enzyme activity (IC\n50\n), the fraction of control activity (FCA) is plotted as a function of the inhibitor concentration (I).\n\n\nThe present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof."
