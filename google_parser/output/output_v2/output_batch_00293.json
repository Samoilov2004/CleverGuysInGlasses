Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF APPLICATION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to new morphine derivatives, pharmaceutical compounds containing said new morphine derivatives and their use for pain management and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CONTEXT OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMorphine is currently the drug of choice to treat acute pain whatever the intensity of the pain. This opioid drug is used in about 80% of cases of postoperative acute pain. Despite a high efficiency, use of morphine implies numerous side effects, specific to opioids, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, inhibition of intestinal transit, addiction and tolerance (Minoru Nariata et al., 2001, Pharmacol & Ther, 89, 1-15).\n\n\nThere are three main classes of opioid receptors: Mu (μ), Kappa (κ) and Delta (δ), all belonging to the family of G protein coupled receptors. Western Blot analysis, FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer) have highlighted monomers and dimers of these three types of receptors. (George S R et al., J Biol Chem 2000, 275: 26128-26135; Jordan B A et al., Nature 1999, 399:697-700; Gomes I et al., J. Neurosci 2000, 20: RC110.). Dimers may be either homodimers or heterodimers. This oligomerisation interferes with the physiologic role of opioid receptors and constitutes a new therapeutic approach of high potential.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, opioid derivatives, once synthesized under dimer shape, show a better affinity and are more efficient than monomers for μ, δ and κ receptors (Hazum et al., Biochem Biophys Res Comm 1982, 104:347-353). Their analgesic activity, after intravenous administration, is higher and their duration of action, longer (WO2005/063263). This latest characteristic enables to decrease the number of administrations while maintaining a maximal analgesic activity, when compared with monomers and other opioids, such as morphine, which exhibits a shorter duration of activity.\n\n\nMoreover, numerous studies (Gomes I et al., J Neurosci 2000, 20: RC110.) have shown a colocalization of μ and δ receptors on one hand and of δ and κ receptors on the other hand, making physiologically possible the existence of heterodimeric receptors. Such hypothesis has been confirmed by FRET analysis, immunoprecipitation and binding profiles (Rios et al., Pharm & Ther 2001, 92: 71-87).\n\n\nFrom a pharmacologic point of view, the interaction of a molecule with opioid receptors results in a more or less important analgesic activity as well as side effects.\n\n\nFor instance, binding to μ receptors is largely responsible for the analgesic activity of the molecule. Two sub-types of μ receptors exist: the μ1 sub-type, with a strong affinity and a poor capacity, and the μ2 sub-type, with a poor affinity and a strong capacity (Pasternak & Wood, 1986, Life Sci 38: 1889-1898). The interaction with μ1 receptors results in an analgesic supraspinal reaction combined with a decrease of the turnover of the acetylcholine, whereas the interaction of μ2 receptors results in an analgesic spinal action, commonly known for generating respiratory depression and inhibition of the intestinal transit.\n\n\nκ and δ receptors play a role especially in intestinal motility and analgesic activity. Moreover, their inhibition contributes to decrease the phenomenon of dependence and respiratory depression. (Rothman et al., 2000, J Subst Abuse Treat 19: 277-281, Shook et al., 1990, Am Rev Respir Dis 142: 895-909, J Neurosci 2005 Mar. 23; 25(12):3229-33. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001 May; 297(2):597-605, J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1998 December; 287(3):815-23).\n\n\nThese receptors are present in the central nervous system, especially at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and also at a peripheral level (Stein et al., 1995, Ann Med, 27(2): 219-21, Janso, Stein, Curr Opin Pharmacol, 2001, 1(1): 62-65).\n\n\nMost identified side effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea, dependence and addiction, are central effects. A way to limit undesirable effects while maintaining an analgesic activity is to design opioids that both interact with the peripheral system and slowly diffuse into the brain (C. Stein, 1990, J of Pain and Symptom Management 6(3): 119-124; Zajaczowska R, Reg Anesth Pain Med, 2004, 29(5): 424-429; Likar et al., 1998, Pain 76(1-2): 145-50; Tokuyama et al., Life Sci, 1998, 62(17-18): 1677-81; Junien, Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 1995, 9(2): 117-26, Dehave-Hudkins et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 1999, 289(1): 494-502, Stein et al., N Engl J Med, 1991, 325: 1123-1126). Indeed, activating opioid receptors of the central nervous system seems to remain the most efficient way to obtain an analgesia comparable with the one obtained with morphine.\n\n\nSome bivalent ligands were designed and synthesized in order to interact with μ/δ heterodimers. In that respect, Daniels et al. studied ligands that were constituted of a μ receptor agonist, oxymorphone, linked with a δ receptor antagonist, naltrindole (Daniels et al., PNAS 2005, 102(52): 19208, WO 2006/073396). The latter is well-known in literature as a specific δ receptor antagonist. They have obtained an analgesic activity for the dimer comparable with oxymorphone by intracerebroventricular administration and a significant decrease of phenomenons of tolerance and physical dependence. Moreover, it appears that these dimers act at the central level. Indeed, their ED50 and the one of morphine appear to be comparable after intravenous and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) administrations.\n\n\nIt is commonly known that morphine undergoes an important metabolism that leads to the formation of Morphine-6-Glucuronide (M6G). This metabolite poorly enters into the brain, because of its hydrophilic nature. Its analgesic activity appears stronger than the one induced by morphine, when centrally administered, whereas nausea and vomiting decrease (Paul et al., 1989. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 251; 477-483; Frances et al., 1992. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 262; 25-31). However, it may provoke, like morphine does, a syndrome of addiction. Moreover, like all metabolites, it is rapidly eliminated by the organism. M6G shows a higher μ affinity (or a comparable one, depending on the studies) than the one shown by morphine, whereas κ affinity is lower (Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, 5, 585-594).\n\n\nM6G seems therefore to be an interesting basis to design an opioid as efficient as morphine without its undesirable side effects.\n\n\nM6G has been produced by synthetic ways since 1968 (Hidetoshi et al., 1968) and its analgesic properties were highlighted in numerous publications (for instance, Frances et al., 1982, Kilpatrick et al.). EP 597 915 B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,046,313 patents describe the synthesis of M6G and M6G derivatives especially at position 3 and EP 1086114 B1 relates to a selective process of synthesis of β anomer of M6G. WO 95/05831 application relates to the use of M6G by oral administration to treat pain.\n\n\nM6G derivatives have been described. For instance, the EP 975 648 B1 patent claims specifically protection for an M6G derivative, wherein the bond between atoms of carbon 7-8 is saturated. The WO2005/063263 application describes sulfured M6G derivatives by substitution thanks to a group carrying a thiol function or a sulfur atom. These sulfur derivatives show a high analgesic activity and less side effects.\n\n\nOpioid derivatives conjugated to carbohydrates, alternative to M6G and its derivatives, have been described in the EP 816 375 patent application.\n\n\nHowever, the need to develop morphine derivatives showing higher analgesic activity and lower side effects remains.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe main object of the present invention is novel M6G derivatives, preferably dimeric or bivalent ligands, showing a strong analgesic activity, a longer duration of action and less side effects than currently used opioids. These derivatives have been designed:\n\n \n \n \n \nto slowly diffuse at the central level, by modulating the hydrophobicity of the made chemical modifications,\n \nto interact with receptors to either homodimer or heterodimer opioids,\n \nto show a strong affinity to μ receptors while inhibiting κ and/or δ receptors in order to decrease some side effects.\n \n \n \n\n\nInventors have established that the addition of a group carrying a thiol function on the carboxylic acid of the M6G glucuronide group and the modification of hydroxyl in position 3 especially by an ether function would enable to obtain compounds showing both a strong μ and κ affinity along with a strong analgesic activity. These properties are particularly accurate with dimerized compounds or bivalent ligands, obtained by oxydation of thiol functions and then formation of a disulfide bridge.\n\n\nLiterature showed that disulfide bonds could improve in vivo properties of active molecules: these bonds, relatively stable in plasma, are cleaved in cells (G. Saito et al., Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 2003, 55, 199-215).\n\n\nThe intended effect of these substitutions is a modification of the pharmacologic profile in comparison with already known M6G derivatives.\n\n\nThe group in position 3 is chosen with a view to increase the lipophylicity of M6G and to improve its central analgesic activity by favouring its crossing of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Literature however showed that some modifications of the hydroxyl in position 3 of the morphinic moiety provoked a loss of analgesic activity, and even toxicity (Abdulghani A Houdi et al., 1996, Pharm Biochem and Beh, 53 (3), 665-671; Salvatella et al., 2004, Biiorg & Med Chem. Lett., 14, 905-908). Inventors showed that a substitution in position 3 by a methoxy group (derivative of 6-codein-glucuronide) leads to an inactive and toxic compound (see example 1). The obtained result for the compounds according to the present invention is therefore unexpected.\n\n\nA second application of these M6G derivatives regards sexual dysfunction and especially male premature ejaculation. Indeed, the efficiency of analgesic administration to treat premature ejaculation has been shown in literature (Eledjam & Safarinejad et al., Cah Anesthesiol. 1991; 39(2): 111-4), for instance local application of analgesics such as lidocaine, tramadol injection (Safarinejad et al., J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2006; 26(1): 27-31, US 2003/0186872 A) or even use of pharmaceutical preparations containing a mix of Viagra/delta opioid receptor agonist (U.S. Pat. No. 6,974,839).\n\n\nThe present invention relates therefore to a compound of Formula (A):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nthe whole entity (A), except for the X substituent, is called \nM\n \n \n \nR3\n6G-NR\n1\nR\n2\n—S;\n\n\nR1 represents a C\n1\n-C\n10 \nalkyl group, the alkyl chain being possibly interrupted by one or several heteroatom(s) chosen among O, S and N;\n\n\nR2 represents a hydrogen, a C\n1\n-C\n5 \nalkyl group, saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, or an aryl, heteroaryl or (C\n1\n-C\n5\n) alkylaryl group;\n\n\nR3 represents a Y(C═Z)R or YR group, Y and Z representing independently oxygen or sulfur, R being a C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl group, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, provided that R3 is different than O—CH\n3\n;\n\n\nX represents a hydrogen, a radical —S—R4-W, or a \nradical M\n \n \n \nR3\n6G-NR\n1\nR\n2\n—S, with R4 being a C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl group that may contain amide, ester, ether bonds and\n\n\nW being either a δ receptor antagonist, or a κ receptor antagonist, as well as one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\nWhen R1 is a substituted alkyl, the substituent may be chosen among the group consisting of a C\n1\n-C\n5 \nalkyl group, saturated or unsaturated, an amino group, a COOR5 group; a CONR5R6 group, R5 and R6 representing independently hydrogen, a saturated or unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n20 \nalkyl group, optionally substituted, an aryl, an heteroaryl; a C\n1\n-C\n20 \nalkyl, preferably in C\n1\n-C\n10\n; bearing an aldehyde function and/or a ketone\n\n\nWhen R2 is substituted, the substituent may be a saturated or unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl group.\n\n\nPreferably, when W is a 8 receptor antagonist, it is chosen among the group consisting of naltrindole, naltriben, 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX), and 7-(5′,6′-benzo-2′-spiro-indanyl)naltrexone (BSINTX).\n\n\nWhen W is a κ receptor antagonist, it is chosen among the group consisting of 5′-guanidinonaltrindole and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI).

Affinity Study of Opioid Receptor\n\n\nB.1/Experimental Procedure\n\n\nThe affinity of M6G to C6G-cya, M3Et-6G-cya and M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G derivatives has been compared for each of the three sub-types of μ, δ and κ opioid receptors.\n\n\nIn order to determine the affinity to μ receptors, homogenates of cell membrane (human μ receptors transfected on HEK-293 cells) were incubated at 22° C. during 120 nm with 0.5 nM of [3H][D-Ala, N-MePhe, Gly(ol)]enkephalin (DAMGO) either with or without one of the compound(s) according to the invention into a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mM MgCl2.\n\n\nIn order to determine the affinity to K receptors, homogenates of guinea-pigs cerebellum (250 μg of protein) were incubated at 22° C. during 80 nm with 0.7 nM of [3H]U-69593 either with or without one of the compound(s) according to the invention into a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM of EDTA.\n\n\nIn order to determine the affinity to δ receptors, homogenates of cell membrane (human Mu receptors transfected on CHO cells) were incubated at 22° C. during 120 nm with 0.5 nM of [3H]DADLE either with or without one of the compound(s) according to the invention into a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mM MgCl2.\n\n\nThe non specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM of naltrexone. After incubation, samples were rapidly filtered through glass fibers (GF/B, Packard), previously incubated with 0.3% of polyethyleneimine and rinsed several times with 50 mM of cold Tris-HCl using a “96-sample cell harvester” (Unifilter, Packard). Filters were afterwards dried and the radioactivity was counted.\n\n\nThe agonist/antagonist activity on K receptors of compounds according to the invention was estimated by using prostatic segments of rabbits' deferens vas, stretched and stimulated by an electric current of 0.1 Hz during 1 msec.\n\n\nIn order to test an agonist activity, a response control (peak of contractions of the tissue) was obtained by exposing tissues to a high concentration (0.1 μM) in U-69593, which is a specific K receptor agonist.\n\n\nTissues were then exposed to growing concentrations of the compound according to the invention or to the specific agonist. The various concentrations were cumulated and each concentration was maintained in contact with the tissue until a stable response was obtained or during a maximum of 15 nm.\n\n\nIf a characteristic response of the agonist was noted (i.e. an inhibition of the contractions), an antagonist of reference, the nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI, 0.001 μM), was tested at the highest concentration of the compound according to the invention to confirm the role of K receptors in the response.\n\n\nIn order to test an antagonist activity, a response control (peak of contraction of the tissue) was obtained by exposing tissues to a high concentration (0.1 μM) in specific agonist U-69593.\n\n\nTissues were then exposed to growing concentrations of the compound according to the invention or to the specific agonist. The various concentrations were cumulated and each concentration was maintained in contact with the tissue until a stable response was obtained or up to 15 nm.\n\n\nAn antagonist response was observed when the amplitude of peaks of contractions provoked by electric stimulation was similar to the one observed with the nor-BNI.\n\n\nThe measured parameter was a maximal change of amplitude of the peaks of contractions provoked by electric stimulation with various concentrations of the compound.\n\n\nB.2/Results\n\n\nThe results of affinity to μ, δ and κ receptors are detailed in the Table 1 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffinity to μ, δ and κ receptors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKi (nM) μ\n\n\nKi (nM) δ\n\n\nKi (nM) κ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMorphine\n\n\n12\n\n\n150\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC6G-\ncya\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \nNC\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM3Et-6G-\ncya\n \n\n\n13\n\n\nNC\n\n\n220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM3Et-6G-cya-cya-\n\n\n14\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM3Et-6G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNC: Not considered because lower than 25% of inhibition to highest concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results show:\n\n \n \n \n \nAn affinity to μ receptors for compounds according to the invention that is similar to morphine.\n \nA loss of affinity for compounds according to the invention to δ receptors when compared with morphine.\n \nAn affinity of C6G-cya and M3Et-6G-cya monomer compounds for K receptors similar to the one of morphine and an improvement of affinity (factor 6) of M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G dimer.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe agonist/antagonist activity of the compound M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G was measured as above described (§ B1): the compound according to the invention behaves as a κ receptor antagonist.\n\n\nResults of agonist/antagonist activity are shown below in Table 2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgonist/antagonist activity on κ receptor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of agonist activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResponse\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nControl at U-\n\n\nResponse to an increasing\n\n\n+nor-BNI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds\n\n\n69593 (0.1 μM)\n\n\nconcentration of the compound\n\n\n(1 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM3Et-6G-cya-\n\n\n100\n\n\n0.03\n\n\nμM\n\n\n0.3\n\n\nμM\n\n\n3\n\n\n \nμM\n \n\n\n30\n\n\nμM\n\n\n10\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncya-M3Et-\n6G\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n−4\n\n\n \n\n\n−3\n\n\n \n\n\n \nNC\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU-69593\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n100\n\n\n0.01\n\n\nμM\n\n\n0.03\n\n\nμM\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n \n\n\n−6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of antagonist activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResponse\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nControl at U-\n\n\nResponse to an increasing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds\n\n\n69593 (0.1 μM)\n\n\nconcentration of the compound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM3Et-6G-cya-\n\n\n100\n\n\n0.03\n\n\nμM\n\n\n0.3\n\n\nμM\n\n\n3\n\n\n \nμM\n \n\n\n30\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncya-M3Et-\n6G\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnor-\nBNI\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nnM\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n \nnM\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \nnM\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n \n\n\n−1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponses are indicated in % of the response control at U-69593 (decrease of the amplitude of contractions).\n\n\nC. Study of Analgesic Activity\n\n\nC.1 Operative Mode\n\n\nThe analgesic activity was determined through both the “Tail flick” and the “Hot plate” tests.\n\n\nThe “Tail flick” test (test of D'Amour & Smith, 1941, Pharmacol Exp Ther; 72: 74-79) consists in placing the tail of a mouse, after administration of a product, in front of an infrared source in order to produce a nociceptive stimulus (a surface temperature of 55° C.). The reaction time (RT) of the mouse (latency between the start of the light beam and the moment the mouse withdraws its tail) was measured in duplicate at 8 times spread from 15 nm to 480 nm after administration of the product. A maximal 10 second-period has been chosen as the maximal reaction time in order to avoid any tissue damage for the animal.\n\n\nProducts were intravenously-administered at doses comprised between 0.5 and 8 mg/kg (8 mice per group).\n\n\nTwo measures of reaction time were realized before administration of the product for each mouse so as to establish a base line.\n\n\nThe “Hot plate” test consists in placing a mouse on a hot plate at 54° C. and in measuring the apparition of one of the following behaviours:\n\n\njump involving at least one of the four paws\n\n\nlicking of front or rear paws,\n\n\nexceeding a 30 second period on the hot plate\n\n\nactivation of the speed of displacement.\n\n\nThe withdrawal time was measured in duplicate at different times spread from 15 nm to 360 nm after injection of the product.\n\n\nA base line was determined for each mouse before administration of the tested product.\n\n\nProducts were intravenously administrated at doses comprised between 0.5 and 8 mg/kg (8 mice per group).\n\n\nC.2/Results\n\n\nWith respect to the tail flick test, obtained results for morphine, M3Et-6G-cya, M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G, C6G-cya-cya-C6G,

Actually, their ED50 is comprised between 1.3 and 2 mg/kg, compared with 3.3 mg/kg for morphine.\n\n\nMoreover, the duration of the analgesic activity is much longer for compounds M3Et-6G-cya and M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G than for morphine. Actually, compounds according to the invention remain at least twice longer active than morphine.\n\n\nD. Study of Intestinal Transit in Mice\n\n\nD.1/Operative Mode\n\n\nAwake mice are force-fed by introducing in the oesophagus of a feeding tube with a 1 ml syringe. 600 μl of gavage paste (notably constituted of activated carbon) are slowly introduced. 30 min after force-feeding, animals are sacrificed. After incision of abdominal wall, the intestines are exposed over all their length. The distance between cardia and rectum is measured (total length) as well as the distance between cardia and marker front.\n\n\nThe effect of compound M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G on constipation was measured at the maximum effect after iv injection at ED50 and then compared to the effect of morphine in the same conditions.\n\n\nIn order to get closer to a clinical case of post-operative pain in which the patient needs an analgesic effect during several hours, the following protocol was used:\n\n\nCompound M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G and morphine are injected at two-fold ED50.\n\n\nIn order to maintain the maximum analgesia during 6 h30, a morphine dose is injected every hour, possibly corresponding to morphine pump in hospital. It is not necessary to inject supplementary dose of M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G since the activity is maximum during at least 6 hours.\n\n\nTransit is then measured from 30 min after force-feeding of mice to 6 hours after administration.\n\n\nA send measure is performed 2 h30 after the last morphine injection or 8 h30 after injection of M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G. Finally, measures are performed 10 h and 12 h after injection of M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G in order to evaluate the return speed to normal transit.\n\n\nD.2/Results\n\n\nThe transit percentage is calculated as following:\n\n\ndistance of marker×100/total length.\n\n\n\nData are shown in \nFIG. 4\n.\n\n\nNo significant difference on the transit is observed between compound M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G and morphine at the maximal analgesic effect after injection at ED50 (transit inhibition of about 90%).\n\n\nIn case of maintenance of maximal analgesia during 6 h30, transit inhibition is lower with compound M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G (52 to 56%) in comparison with morphine (82%).\n\n\nWhen the analgesic activity is maintained at maximum with morphine, transit is completely stopped. Transit restarts when the morphine injections are stopped, together with a drop of analgesic activity.\n\n\nIn case of compound M3Et-6G-cya-cya-M3Et-6G, transit only slows down whereas the analgesic activity stays maximum. The transit speed becomes normal between 10 and 12 hours with an analgesia of 50%."
