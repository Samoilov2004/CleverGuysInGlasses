Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, in particular, a pyridone compound which is useful as an agent for treating peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral arterial occlusive disease, caused by artery stenosis/occlusion due to arteriosclerosis and thrombus formation, thus leading the peripheral, in particular, the lower extremities into ischemia, is a disease with symptoms such as coldness, intermittent claudication, pain, ulcers/necrosis of the lower extremities, and the like. As for the diagnosis and treatment of the peripheral arterial occlusive disease, the guidelines are provided in “Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus for Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC) II” (Eur. J. Vasc. Endovasc. Surg, 2007, 33 (1), S1). For the improvement of the symptoms of the lower extremities, it is important to improve the blood flow into the ischemic part, and treatment for promoting the resumption of the blood circulation by a pharmaceutical or physical method is carried out. For a drug therapy, drugs having a vasodilating action or a platelet aggregation inhibiting action have been used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPGE2 is known as one of the metabolites in an arachidonic acid cascade. The PGE2 exhibits various physiological activities such as a pain inducing and increasing action, a pro-inflammatory action, an anti-inflammatory action, an uterine contractile action, a digestive peristalsis promoting action, an awaking action, a gastric acid secretion inhibiting action, a hypotensive action, a platelet aggregation inhibiting action, an angiogenic action, and the like. It has become clear that there are four subtypes of PGE2 receptors, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, which have wide distributions in various tissues. The activation of the EP1 receptor is believed to cause the increase in intracellular Ca\n2+\n. For the EP3 receptor, there exist the receptors having different pathways for second-messenger systems. The activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors is believed to cause the activation of an adenylate cyclase, and thus to increase the intracellular cAMP level (Phsiol. Rev., 1999, 79, 1193).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe EP4 receptor is associated with smooth muscle relaxation through the increase in cAMP (Br. J. Pharmacol., 2001, 134, 313). Further, it is suggested that the platelet aggregation inhibiting action is exhibited via EP4 in that the expression of the EP4 receptors (Circulation, 2001, 104, 1176) and the cAMP increasing action by PGE2 (Prostaglandins, 1996, 52, 175) are also demonstrated in the platelets. From this, the EP4 agonist is expected to be an agent for treating peripheral arterial occlusive disease, which exhibits a blood flow improving action. In addition to these, it is believed that it is useful as an agent for treating renal diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, gastric mucosal protection, glaucoma, and the like, from the viewpoint that EP4 receptor is associated with increase in the renal blood flow (Am. J. Physiol. 279, F755, 2000), inhibition of the mesangium cell proliferation (Kid. Int., 1999, 56, 589), inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine production (Biochem. Pharmacol., 2001, 61, 1153), osteogenesis (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2002, 99, 4580), secretion of the gastrointestinal mucus (Gastroenterology, 1999, 117, 1352), intraocular pressure control (Patent Documents 1 to 5), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs compounds having an EP4 receptor agonistic action, following Patent Documents 1 to 7 are reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 1, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (A) has an EP4 receptor agonistic action, and is thus useful for the treatment of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to the publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 2, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (B) has an EP4 receptor agonistic action, and is thus useful for the treatment of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to the publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 3, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (C) has an EP4 receptor agonistic action, and is thus useful for the treatment of glaucoma, osteoporosis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to the publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 4, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (D) has an EP4 receptor agonistic action, and is thus useful for the treatment of glaucoma, inflammatory bowel disease, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to the publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 5, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (E) has an EP4 receptor agonistic action, and is thus useful for the treatment of glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to the publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 6, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (F) has an EP4 receptor agonistic action, and is thus useful for the treatment of osteoporosis, and other bone diseases.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to the publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 7, which is an application filed by the present Applicant(s) and published after the priority date of the present application, it is reported that a compound represented by the following formula (G) has an EPR4 agonistic action and is useful against peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the following compounds are reported as a pyridone derivative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Patent Document 8, it has been reported that a compound represented by the following formula (H) is useful as an agent for controlling plant disease.

An Opti-MEM culture medium at 1.2 mL/dish and a transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000, manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation) at 60 μL/dish were mixed, followed by being left to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Then, the rat EP4 receptor expression vector at 15 μg/dish was added thereto, followed by being left to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The liquid mixture of the transfection reagent was added into the dish, followed by culturing for 20 to 24 hours. The cell culture was carried out in a CO\n2 \nincubator (37° C., 5% CO\n2\n).\n\n\n \n(2) Preparation of Membrane Fraction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe culture medium was removed by suction, 10 mL of cooled PBS was added thereto per 15 cm dish, and the cells were scraped using a cell scraper. After washed with cooled PBS (1,200 rpm, 4° C., 5 minutes), suspended in 6 mL/dish of cooled 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4; manufactured by Nacalai Tesque Inc., 5 mM EDTA included) and homogenized using a Polytron, the homogenate was centrifuged (26,000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4° C.). The obtained precipitate was resuspended in cooled 20 mM Tris-HCl and homogenized again using a Polytron, and the homogenate was centrifuged (26,000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4° C.). The obtained precipitate was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5; manufactured by Dojindo Laboratories) at 1 mL per dish, homogenized using a Polytron, and freeze-stored at −80° C. as a membrane fraction. At this time, a part thereof was used for the measurement of the protein concentration.

Dilution of [\n3\nH]PGE2 and the membrane fraction was carried out using the assay buffer, and dilution of the test compound and the unlabeled PGE2 was carried out using dimethyl sulfoxide and the assay buffer. The UniFilter-96 GF/B was treated by preliminarily washing twice with 200 μL/well of the cooled assay buffer. The UniFilter-96 GF/B after filtration was dried in a dryer overnight, 50 μL/well of a liquid scintillation cocktail (MicroScint20, manufactured by Perkin Elmer Co., Ltd.) was added thereto, and the radioactivity was then measured using a liquid scintillation counter for a microplate (TopCount, manufactured by Perkin Elmer Co., Ltd.). For measurement of the non-specific binding, an unlabeled PGE2 (final concentration 1 μM; manufactured by Cayman Chemical Company) was added. All of the measurements were carried out in duplicate, and the specific binding amount was determined by subtracting the non-specific binding amount from the total binding amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the test method as described above, the rat EP4 receptor affinity (Ki) of the compound of the formula (I) was measured.
