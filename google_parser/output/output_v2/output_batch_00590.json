Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/617108 by Sanders et al., filed October 8, 2004\n \n, which is incorporated by reference in entirety.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention was made, at least in part, with government support under Grant Nos. GM50694 and GM65307 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as pamidronate (Aredia®) C1; alendronate (Fosamax®) C2; risedronate (Actonel®) C3; and zoledronate (Zometa®) C4; shown in their zwitterionic forms in \nFigure 1\n, represent an important class of drugs, currently used to treat osteoporosis, Paget's disease and hypercalcemia due to malignancy. See references 1-4. These compounds function primarily by inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) (references 5-12) resulting in decreased levels of protein prenylation in osteoclasts (references 13-15). Certain bisphosphonates have also been found to have anti-parasitic activity (references 16-25) and have been found to stimulate human γδ T cells (references 26-30); there is currently interest in their use as vaccines for a variety of B cell malignancies (reference 31).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferences in substituents, however, can strongly influence the pharmacologic properties of such compounds (Green, 2001). Structural differences may also be significant in the potential expansion of therapies. For example, Bonefos (clodronate) is a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment of tumor-induced osteolysis and hypercalcemia. It has been reported to increase survival and reduce the risk of bone metastasis in women with stage II/III breast cancer. This is noteworthy as approximately 70% of women who develop recurrence of breast cancer will experience bone metastasis, and breast cancer remains the leading cause of death among women aged 40 to 55 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor even second generation bisphosphonates, it is recognized that small changes of structure can lead to marked improvements in activity or function, for example in the inhibition of osteoclastic resorption potency (Widler et al., 2002). Therefore, there is great interest in the further development of alternative bisphosphonate compounds and the exploration of methods of use such as clinical applications.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention surprisingly provides the first report of the synthesis and testing of a series of pyridinium-1-yl and related bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonate compounds of the invention can demonstrate activity in one or more contexts, including a farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) assay, a \nD. discoideum\n growth inhibition assay, a T cell activation assay, a bone resorption assay, the treatment of infectious disease, the treatment of a bone resorption clinical disorder, an immunotherapeutic treatment, the treatment of cancer, and the treatment of bone pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention broadly provides bisphosphonate compounds and related methods of making and using. The invention specifically provides compounds with an N-linkage including pyridinium-1-yl, quinolinium-1-yl, and related bisphosphonate compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are applicable.

Bisphosphonate compounds.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe report the design, synthesis and testing of a series of novel bisphosphonates. The most potent molecules have high activity and can represent usefu I compositions for a variety of applications such as in bone resorption disorders, parasitic diseases, immunomodulation, and cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur efforts led to the prediction of the importance of the presence of a positive charge at a relatively localized position in the bisphosphonate side chain. This can be related to the position of the positive charge expected in the pyridinium and imidazolium forms of compounds C3 and C4, shown above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe explored the possibility that the pyridinium-1-yl species, compound C5, might have useful activity. We synthesized C5 and a series of derivatives (compounds C7-C18, \nFigure 7\n), using the following general scheme, \nScheme\n 1.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first step, we used (where necessary) coupling reactions of arylmetallic compounds with bromopyridines, catalyzed by Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n (ref. 32) or NiCl\n2\n(PPh\n3\n)\n2\n (ref. 33) to produce substituted pyridines. The substituted pyridines were then alkylated by using bromoacetic acid (ref. 34) and the resulting pyridinium-1-yl acetic acids were converted to the corresponding bisphosphonates by using H\n3\nPO\n3\n/POCl\n3\n (ref. 35).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe then investigated the activity of each compound in inhibiting the FPPS from \nL\n. \nmajor\n, in \nDictyostelium discoideum\n growth inhibition and in γδ T cell activation. We used the FPPS from \nL. major\n since this enzyme is the putative bisphosphonate target in several trypanosomatid species. We used \nD. discoideum\n to test for cell growth inhibition, since this organism has been useful in the context of the development of bone resorption drugs (ref. 36). To determine the stimulatory activity of compounds C5 and C7-C18 for Vγ2Vδ2 T cells, we used the TNF-α release assay (ref. 30).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the \nL. major\n FPPS inhibition assay, C5 was found to have a Ki of 18 nM (Table 6) and was thus slightly less active than the most potent commercially available bisphosphonates, zoledronate (4, Ki = 11 nM in this assay) and risedronate (3, Ki = 17 nM in this assay) (Table 6). In order to try to enhance activity, we next investigated the desirability of placing substituents at the meta position. We thus prepared compounds C7-C9 (\nFigure 7\n) and tested them in the FPPS assay. The meta-methyl analog of C5 (C7) was not as active as C5 (Ki = 38 nM versus 18 nM), but substitution with a meta- phenyl group, giving C8, resulted in a very potent species, having a Ki = 9 nM, slightly more active than zoledronate, 4 (Ki = 11 nM). The para-phenoxy derivative of C5 (C9) was found to be less active (Ki = 75 nM), possibly due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions of the OH group in the FPPS active site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Table 1.

Both of these compounds contain a methylene linker between the two aromatic groups and it seemed possible that they might better mimic the putative geranyl diphosphate reactive intermediate (C19):\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nbut each of these compounds was approximately ten-fold less active than C8, with Ki values in the 70-160 nM range, Table 1. We also prepared the biphenylpyridinium compound, C12, since the added hydrophobicity of C8 appeared encouraging, but C12 proved to be relatively inactive, having a Ki of 950 nM. The isoquinoline and quinoline species, C13 and C14, had modest activity (80 and 380 nM, respectively, for C13 and C14), but the meta- ethyl (C15), butyl (C16), methoxy (C17) and para-benzyl (C18) pyridinium species were generally more active (20, 20, 30 and 110 nM, respectively), although they were less active than compounds C3-C6, C8. See Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next investigated \nD. discoideum\n growth inhibition by compounds 1-18 (Table 1; alternatively referred to as C1-C18). The most active compound found was the meta-methyl pyridinium compound, C7, which had an IC\n50\n of 1.5 µM, followed by incadronate (C6, IC\n50\n = 1.6 µM) and zoledronate (C4, IC\n50\n = 1.9 µM). The unsubstituted pyridinium bisphosphonate, C5, was slightly more active (IC\n50\n = 2.1 µM) than was risedronate (C3, IC\n50\n = 2.8 µM). As with the FPPS inhibition results, the benzylpyridinium bisphosphonates (C10,C11,C18) were less active than the pyridinium and phenylpyridinium species (C5, C7-9). Surprisingly, C12 showed high activity, due perhaps to the possibility of an additional target in \nD. discoideum\n or the possibility of structural differences between \nL. major\n and \nD. discoideum\n FPPS enzymes. With the exception of C12, the activity results for the 17 bisphosphonates are highly correlated (R\n2\n = 0.65, p < 0.0001), as shown in \nFigure 8A\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, we investigated the ability of C5 and compounds C7-C18 to stimulate gammadelta T cells, using the TNF-α release assay (ref. 30). The most active compound was found to be C8 (EC\n50\n = 3.7 µM), followed by C7 and C17 (EC\n50\n = 4.6 µM), with these compounds having more activity than risedronate (C3, EC\n50\n = 6.2 µM) (ref. 30) or zoledronate (C4, EC\n50\n = 7.3 µM) (ref. 30) in this TNF-α release assay. Addition of the para hydroxyl group (8 → 9) again reduced activity (Table 1), and again all three methylene bridged compounds (C10,C11,C18) had poor activity. The activity results for FPPS inhibition were found to be highly correlated with gammadelta T cell TNF-α release results (R\n2\n = 0.68, p < 0.0001), as shown in \nFigure 8B\n, suggesting the likely importance of FPPS inhibition in gammadelta T cell activation (refs. 29,30).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also explored the idea that electron withdrawing substituents on the ring could improve activity in bone resorption. To test this, \ncompound\n 461 was prepared and tested, and indeed this species was found to be very potent in bone resorption. See Table 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by a particular theory, these results may confirm the importance of a positive charge at the N-1 position. This suggests that the further development of this class of compounds can continue to be of interest in the context of the chemotherapy of infectious diseases, bone resorption, cancer, bone pain, and in immunotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2.

Exploration of activity of bisphosphonate compounds and strategic design of compounds.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe explored the hypothesis of whether analogs of pyrophosphate could block pyrophosphatase enzymes and/or inhibit cellular growth or function. We used certain bisphosphonate compounds that are currently applied in bone resorption therapy. The compounds included pamidronate (Aredia®, Novartis), alendronate (Fosamax®, Merck), and risedronate (Actonel®, Procter & Gamble). The compounds did not appear necessarily to inhibit pyrophosphatases but did inhibit parasite cell growth. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the compounds appeared to act as inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FPP synthase inhibitor pamidronate was observed to be effective in treating cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice. The average lesion size in treated mice was reduced during a time period of several weeks and in a dose-dependent manner relative to treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a compound of the invention inhibits deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis. In a particular embodiment, a compound is able to affect \nPlasmodium in vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, a compound inhibits the mevalonate pathway. In an embodiment of the invention, a compound interacts with IPP isomerase (next to FPP synthase in the isoprene biosynthesis pathway) and activates gammadelta T cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5. Activity of bisphosphonate compounds in bone resorption.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds are tested in a bone resorption assay: \n45\nCa\n2+\n release from 17-day old fetal mouse metatarsals (ref. 37). Results of IC\n50\n values for test compounds are observed and optionally compared to those for reference compounds such as risedronate (C3), alendronate (C2), and pamidronate (C1) and/or other bisphosphonate compounds known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, bisphosphonates of the invention such as the pyridinium-1-yl bisphosphonates are comparable to or more active in the bone resorption assay or in treatment of a bone resorption clinical disorder than one or more other reference bisphosphonates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6. Application of bisphosphonate compounds in the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds are tested for efficacy in reducing the occurrence, severity, or course of bone metastases in stage II/III breast cancer patients. A compound of the invention is found effective and administered to a patient in need of treatment. Treatment with a compound of the invention is effective in reducing the risk of bone metastasis and/or increasing the likelihood of survival, optionally in relation to treatment with a placebo. A compound is effective in enhancing a survival outcome in patients with more advanced disease. A compound administered to a cancer patient can simultaneously provide a benefit in the treatment of osteolysis and/or hypercalcemia while assisting in the prevention of bone metastasis and significantly increasing overall survival in breast cancer patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the invention are applied in the treatment of skin metastases and mediastinal lymphomas. See Wilhelm et al., 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the invention are useful in the treatment of cancers such as lymphoma and myeloma and/or other forms of cancer. See \nGreen JR, 2004, The Oncologist 9(supp 4):3-13\n; \nForsea A-M et al., 2004, British Journal of Cancer 91:803-810\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the invention are used in a combination therapy in the treatment of cancer. In a specific embodiment, a combination therapy utilizes a bisphosphonate compound of the invention and a different chemotherapeutic agent which can optionally be a distinct other bisphosphonate compound. See \nCaraglia M et al., 2004, Oncogene 23:6900-6913\n. See \nSalomo M et al., 2003, British Journal of Haematology 122:202-210\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7. Application of bisphosphonate compounds in the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany HIV drugs are suboptimally effective in partial relation to mutations of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase that confer resistance to a drug. For example, the effectiveness of azidothymidine (AZT; zidovudine, Retrovir), is believed to be so diminished. Bisphosphonate compounds of the invention are used in conjunction with AZT to provide an improved composition and therapy. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, a bisphosphonate compound inhibits AZT excision caused by ATP or PPi; the inhibition results in increased AZT activity in enzyme and cellular assays. A reversion of resistance phenotype is achieved by rendering an HIV-1 strain more sensitive to AZT activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8. Additional bisphosphonate compounds.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther bisphosphonate compounds were synthesized. The structures are indicated in \nFigure 9\n, Figure 10, and Figure 11. As noted in other Examples herein, the functional activity of certain of these compounds was assessed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9. Bisphosphonate compounds have activity in several contexts relating to bone resorption and immune regulation.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have obtained data for selected bisphosphonate compounds in the contexts of \nD. discoideum\n assays, human FPPS assays, gammadelta T cell stimulation assays, and bone resorption assays. Several compounds showed substantial activity in one or more functional assays. Some toxicity testing was also performed. See Table 4 (in some instances, the same data depicted elsewhere herein, e.g., in Table 1, may be presented again to facilitate comparative analysis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Table 4.\n

issued or granted patents or equivalents; patent application publications; and non-patent literature documents or other source material; are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, as though individually incorporated by reference, to the extent each reference is at least partially not inconsistent with the disclosure in this application (for example, a reference that is partially inconsistent is incorporated by reference except for the partially inconsistent portion of the reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a group of substituents is disclosed herein, it is understood that all individual members of those groups and all subgroups, including any isomers and enantiomers of the group members, and classes of compounds that can be formed using the substituents are disclosed separately. When a Markush group or other grouping is used herein, all individual members of the group and all combinations and subcombinations possible of the group are intended to be individually included in the disclosure. When a compound is described herein such that a particular isomer or enantiomer of the compound is not specified, for example, in a formula or in a chemical name, that description is intended to include each isomer and enantiomer of the compound described individually or in any combination. When an atom is described herein, including in a composition, any isotope of such atom is intended to be included. Specific names of compounds are intended to be exemplary, as it is known that one of ordinary skill in the art can name the same compounds differently. Every formulation or combination of components described or exemplified herein can be used to practice the invention, unless otherwise stated. Whenever a range is given in the specification, for example, a temperature range, a time range, or a composition range, all intermediate ranges and subranges, as well as all individual values included in the ranges given are intended to be included in the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patents and publications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the levels of skill of those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. References cited herein are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety to indicate the state of the art, in some cases as of their filing date, and it is intended that this information can be employed herein, if needed, to exclude (for example, to disclaim) specific embodiments that are in the prior art. For example, when a compound is claimed, it should be understood that compounds known in the prior art, including certain compounds disclosed in the references disclosed herein (particularly in referenced patent documents), are not intended to be included in the claim.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the terms \"comprise\", \"comprises\", \"comprised\", or \"comprising\" are used herein, they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, or components referred to, but not to preclude the presence or addition of one or more other feature, integer, step, component, or group thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention has been described with reference to various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques. However, it should be understood that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that methods, devices, device elements, materials, procedures and techniques other than those specifically described herein can be applied to the practice of the invention as broadly disclosed herein without resort to undue experimentation. All art-known functional equivalents of methods, devices, device elements, materials, procedures and techniques described herein are intended to be encompassed by this invention. Whenever a range is disclosed, all subranges and individual values are intended to be encompassed. This invention is not to be limited by the embodiments disclosed, including any shown in the drawings or exemplified in the specification, which are given by way of example or illustration and not of limitation.\n\n\n \n[00163] REFERENCES\n\n\n \n \n \n(1) \nSambrook, P.

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to interleukin-23 p19 (IL-23p19) specific antibodies and uses thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to humanized antibodies that recognize human IL-23p19 and modulate its activity, particularly in inflammatory, autoimmune and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune system functions to protect individuals from infective agents, e.g., bacteria, multi-cellular organisms, and viruses, as well as from cancers. This system includes several types of lymphoid and myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. These lymphoid and myeloid cells often produce signaling proteins known as cytokines. The immune response includes inflammation, i.e., the accumulation of immune cells systemically or in a particular location of the body. In response to an infective agent or foreign substance, immune cells secrete cytokines which, in turn, modulate immune cell proliferation, development, differentiation, or migration. Immune response can produce pathological consequences, e.g., when it involves excessive inflammation, as in the autoimmune disorders (see, e.g., \nAbbas, et al. (eds.) (2000) Cellular and Molecular Immunology, W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA\n; \nOppenheim and Feldmann (eds.) (2001) Cytokine Reference, Academic Press, San Diego, CA\n; \nvon Andrian and Mackay (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 343:1020-1034\n; \nDavidson and Diamond (2001) New Engl. J. Med. 345:340-350\n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric molecule composed of p35 and p40 subunits. Studies have indicated that IL-12 plays a critical role in the differentiation of naïve T cells into T-helper type 1 CD4\n+\n lymphocytes that secrete IFNγ. It has also been shown that IL-12 is essential for T cell dependent immune and inflammatory responses in vivo. (See, e.g.,\n Cua, et al. (2003) Nature 421:744-748\n. The IL-12 receptor is composed of IL-12beta1 and IL-12beta2 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-23 (IL-23) is a heterodimeric cytokine comprised of two subunits, p19 which is unique to IL-23, and p40, which is shared with IL-12. The p19 subunit is structurally related to IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the p35 subunit of IL-12. IL-23 mediates signaling by binding to a heterodimeric receptor, comprised of IL-23R and IL-12β1, which is shared by the IL-12 receptor. A number of early studies demonstrated that the consequences of a genetic deficiency in p40 (p40 knockout mouse; p40KO mouse) were more severe than those found in a p35KO mouse. Some of these results were eventually explained by the discovery of IL-23, and the finding that the p40KO prevents expression of IL-12, but also of IL-23 (see, e.g., \nOppmann, et al. (2000) Immunity 13:715-725\n; \nWiekowski, et al. (2001) J. Immunol. 166:7563-7570\n; \nParham, et al.(2002) J Immunol 168:5699-708\n; \nFrucht (2002) Sci STKE 2002, E1-E3\n; \nElkins, et al. (2002) Infection Immunity 70:1936-1948\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies, through the use of p40 KO mice, have shown that blockade of both IL-23 and IL-12 is an effective treatment for various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. However, the blockade of IL-12 through p40, appears to have various systemic consequences such as increased susceptibility to opportunistic microbial infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most significant limitation in using antibodies as a therapeutic agent \nin vivo\n is the immunogenicity of the antibodies. As most monoclonal antibodies are derived from rodents, repeated use in humans results in the generation of an immune response against the therapeutic antibody. Such an immune response results in a loss of therapeutic efficacy at a minimum and a potential fatal anaphylactic response at a maximum. Initial efforts to reduce the immunogenicity of rodent antibodies involved the production of chimeric antibodies, in which mouse variable regions were fused with human constant regions. \nLiu et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439-43\n. However, mice injected with hybrids of human variable regions and mouse constant regions develop a strong anti-antibody response directed against the human variable region, suggesting that the retention of the entire rodent Fv region in such chimeric antibodies may still result in unwanted immunogenicity in patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally believed that complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of variable domains comprise the binding site of antibody molecules. Therefore, the grafting of rodent CDR loops onto human frameworks (\ni.e.,\n humanization) was attempted to further minimize rodent sequences. \nJones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522\n; \nVerhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239:1534\n. However, CDR loop exchanges still do not uniformly result in an antibody with the same binding properties as the antibody of origin. Changes in framework residues (FR), residues involved in CDR loop support, in humanized antibodies also are required to preserve antigen binding affinity. \nKabat et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:1709\n. While the use of CDR grafting and framework residue preservation in a number of humanized antibody constructs has been reported, it is difficult to predict if a particular sequence will result in the antibody with the desired binding, and sometimes biological, properties. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nQueen et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029\n, \nGorman et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:4181\n, and \nHodgson (1991) Biotechnology (NY) 9:421-5\n. Moreover, most prior studies used different human sequences for animal light and heavy variable sequences, rendering the predictive nature of such studies questionable. Sequences of known antibodies have been used or, more typically, those of antibodies having known X-ray structures, antibodies NEW and KOL. \nSee, e.g.,\n Jones et al., \nsupra;\n Verhoeyen et al., \nsupra;\n and Gorman et al., \nsupra.\n Exact sequence information has been reported for a few humanized constructs.

In some embodiments, the epitope is defined as a stretch of 8 or more contiguous amino acid residues along the IL-23p19 sequence in which at least 50%, 70% or 85% of the residues are within the specified distance of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the present invention provides a binding compound that binds to human IL-23 and has a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) with at least 95%, 90%. 85%, 80%, 75% or 50% sequence homology with the residues 20-129 of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4.

Table 7 below provides a listing of sequence identifiers used in this application. All references cited herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent application, or patent, was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nI. Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \n\"Activation,\" \"stimulation,\" and \"treatment,\" as it applies to cells or to receptors, may have the same meaning, e.g., activation, stimulation, or treatment of a cell or receptor with a ligand, unless indicated otherwise by the context or explicitly. \"Ligand\" encompasses natural and synthetic ligands, e.g., cytokines, cytokine variants, analogues, muteins, and binding compositions derived from antibodies. \"Ligand\" also encompasses small molecules, e.g., peptide mimetics of cytokines and peptide mimetics of antibodies. \"Activation\" can refer to cell activation as regulated by internal mechanisms as well as by external or environmental factors. \"Response,\" e.g., of a cell, tissue, organ, or organism, encompasses a change in biochemical or physiological behavior, e.g., concentration, density, adhesion, or migration within a biological compartment, rate of gene expression, or state of differentiation, where the change is correlated with activation, stimulation, or treatment, or with internal mechanisms such as genetic programming.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Activity\" of a molecule may describe or refer to the binding of the molecule to a ligand or to a receptor, to catalytic activity; to the ability to stimulate gene expression or cell signaling, differentiation, or maturation; to antigenic activity, to the modulation of activities of other molecules, and the like. \"Activity\" of a molecule may also refer to activity in modulating or maintaining cell-to-cell interactions, e.g., adhesion, or activity in maintaining a structure of a cell, e.g., cell membranes or cytoskeleton. \"Activity\" can also mean specific activity, e.g., [catalytic activity]/[mg protein], or [immunological activity]/[mg protein], concentration in a biological compartment, or the like. \"Proliferative activity\" encompasses an activity that promotes, that is necessary for, or that is specifically associated with, e.g., normal cell division, as well as cancer, tumors, dysplasia, cell transformation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Administration\" and \"treatment,\" as it applies to an animal, human, experimental subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid, refers to contact of an exogenous pharmaceutical, therapeutic, diagnostic agent, or composition to the animal, human, subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid. \"Administration\" and \"treatment\" can refer, e.g., to therapeutic, pharmacokinetic, diagnostic, research, and experimental methods. Treatment of a cell encompasses contact of a reagent to the cell, as well as contact of a reagent to a fluid, where the fluid is in contact with the cell. \"Administration\" and \"treatment\" also means \nin vitro\n and \nex vivo\n treatments, e.g., of a cell, by a reagent, diagnostic, binding composition, or by another cell. \"Treatment,\" as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, refers to therapeutic treatment, prophylactic or preventative measures, to research and diagnostic applications. \"Treatment\" as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, or cell, tissue, or organ, encompasses contact of an IL-23 agonist or IL-23 antagonist to a human or animal subject, a cell, tissue, physiological compartment, or physiological fluid. \"Treatment of a cell\" also encompasses situations where the IL-23 agonist or IL-23 antagonist contacts IL-23 receptor (IL-23R/IL-12Rbeta1 heterodimer), e.g., in the fluid phase or colloidal phase, but also situations where the agonist or antagonist does not contact the cell or the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to any form of antibody or fragment thereof that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (\ne.g.,\n bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"IL-23p19 binding fragment\" or \"binding fragment thereof' encompasses a fragment or a derivative of an antibody that still substantially retain its biological activity of inhibiting IL-23p19 activity. Therefore, the term \"antibody fragment\" or IL-23p19 binding fragment refers to a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of its IL-23p19 inhibitory activity. Preferably, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 100% (or more) of its IL-23p19 inhibitory activity, although any binding fragment with sufficient affinity to exert the desired biological effect will be useful. It is also intended that a IL-23p19 binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions that do not substantially alter its biologic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\", as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, \ni.e.,\n the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., (1975) Nature 256: 495\n, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods \n(see, e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in \nClackson et al., (1991) Nature 352: 624-628\n and \nMarks et al., (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597\n, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"domain antibody\" is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH\n regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH\n regions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"bivalent antibody\" comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see \nPluckthun (1994) THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nMuyldermans et al. (2001) Trends Biochem. Sci. 26:230\n; \nReichmann et al. (1999) J. Immunol. Methods 231:25\n; \n \nWO 94/04678\n \n; \n \nWO 94/25591\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079\n \n, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V\nH\n domains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL\n or V\nL\n-V\nH\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and \nHolliger et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448\n. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see \nHolliger and Hudson (2005) Nat. Biotechnol. 23:1126-1136\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"humanized antibody\" refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. Such antibodies contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The prefix \"hum\" is added to antibody clone designations when necessary to distinguish humanized antibodies (e.g. hum6H12) from parental rodent antibodies (e.g. mouse 6H12, or \"m6H12\"). The humanized forms of rodent antibodies will generally comprise the same CDR sequences of the parental rodent antibodies, although certain amino acid substitutions may be included to increase affinity or increase stability of the humanized antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies with modified (or blocked) Fc regions to provide altered effector functions. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821\n \n; \n \nWO2003/086310\n \n; \n \nWO2005/12057\n \n; \n \nWO2006/0057702\n \n; \nPresta (2006) Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 58:640-656\n. Such modification can be used to enhance or suppress various reactions of the immune system, with possible beneficial effects in diagnosis and therapy. Alterations of the Fc region include amino acid changes (substitutions, deletions and insertions), glycosylation or deglycosylation, and adding multiple Fc. Changes to the Fc can also alter the half-life of antibodies in therapeutic antibodies, and a longer half-life would result in less frequent dosing, with the concomitant increased convenience and decreased use of material. \nSee\n \nPresta (2005) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.116:731 at 734-35\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"fully human antibody\" refers to an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, \"mouse antibody\" refers to an antibody which comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"hypervariable region\" refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a \"complementarity determining region\" or \"CDR\" \n(e.g.\n residues 24-34 (CDRL1), 50-56 (CDRL2) and 89-97 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (CDR1), 50-65 (CDRH2) and 95-102 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; \nKabat et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md\n.) and/or those residues from a \"hypervariable loop\" (\ni.e.\n residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; \nChothia and Lesk, (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917\n). As used herein, the term \"framework\" or \"FR\" residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues. The residue numbering above relates to the Kabat numbering system and does not necessarily correspond in detail to the sequence numbering in the accompanying Sequence Listing. \nSee\n Tables 2 and 3, in which sequence numbering is with reference to the Sequence Listing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Binding compound\" refers to a molecule, small molecule, macromolecule, polypeptide, antibody or fragment or analogue thereof, or soluble receptor, capable of binding to a target. \"Binding compound\" also may refer to a complex of molecules, e.g., a non-covalent complex, to an ionized molecule, and to a covalently or non-covalently modified molecule, e.g., modified by phosphorylation, acylation, cross-linking, cyclization, or limited cleavage, which is capable of binding to a target. When used with reference to antibodies, the term \"binding compound\" refers to both antibodies and binding fragments thereof. \"Binding\" refers to an association of the binding composition with a target where the association results in reduction in the normal Brownian motion of the binding composition, in cases where the binding composition can be dissolved or suspended in solution. \"Binding composition\" refers to a molecule, e.g. a binding compound, in combination with a stabilizer, excipient, salt, buffer, solvent, or additive, capable of binding to a target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Conservatively modified variants\" or \"conservative substitution\" refers to substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity \n(see, e.g.,\n \nWatson, et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Edition 1987\n)). Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table 1 as follows:\n\n \nTable 1\n \n \n \nExemplary Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions\n \n \n \nOriginal residue\n \nConservative substitution\n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nGly; Ser\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nLys, His\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \nGln; His\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nGlu; Asn\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nSer; Ala\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nAsn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nAsp; Gln\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nAla\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nAsn; Gln\n \n \n \nIle (I)\n \nLeu; Val\n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nIle; Val\n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \nArg; His\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nLeu; Ile; Tyr\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nTyr; Met; Leu\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nAla\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nThr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nSer\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \nTyr; Phe\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \nTrp; Phe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nIle; Leu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"consists essentially of,\" or variations such as \"consist essentially of\" or \"consisting essentially of,\" as used throughout the specification and claims, indicate the inclusion of any recited elements or group of elements, and the optional inclusion of other elements, of similar or different nature than the recited elements, that do not materially change the basic or novel properties of the specified dosage regimen, method, or composition. As a nonlimiting example, a binding compound that consists essentially of a recited amino acid sequence may also include one or more amino acids, including substitutions of one or more amino acid residues, that do not materially affect the properties of the binding compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Effective amount\" encompasses an amount sufficient to ameliorate or prevent a symptom or sign of the medical condition. Effective amount also means an amount sufficient to allow or facilitate diagnosis. An effective amount for a particular patient or veterinary subject may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated, the overall health of the patient, the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,888,530 issued to Netti, et al\n \n.). An effective amount can be the maximal dose or dosing protocol that avoids significant side effects or toxic effects. The effect will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 5%, usually by at least 10%, more usually at least 20%, most usually at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 60%, ideally at least 70%, more ideally at least 80%, and most ideally at least 90%, where 100% is defined as the diagnostic parameter shown by a normal subject (see, e.g., \nMaynard, et al. (1996) A Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice, Interpharm Press, Boca Raton, FL\n; \nDent (2001) Good Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice, Urch Publ., London, UK\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Exogenous\" refers to substances that are produced outside an organism, cell, or human body, depending on the context. \"Endogenous\" refers to substances that are produced within a cell, organism, or human body, depending on the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immune condition\" or \"immune disorder\" encompasses, e.g., pathological inflammation, an inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune disorder or disease. \"Immune condition\" also refers to infections, persistent infections, and proliferative conditions, such as cancer, tumors, and angiogenesis, including infections, tumors, and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system. \"Cancerous condition\" includes, e.g., cancer, cancer cells, tumors, angiogenesis, and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inflammatory disorder\" means a disorder or pathological condition where the pathology results, in whole or in part, from, e.g., a change in number, change in rate of migration, or change in activation, of cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system include, e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes or macrophages, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells, microglia, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, or any other cell specifically associated with the immunology, for example, cytokine-producing endothelial or epithelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"IL-17-producing cell\" means a T cell that is not a classical TH1-type T cell or classical TH2-type T cell, referred to as T\nH\n17 cells. T\nH\n17 cells are discussed in greater detail at \nCua and Kastelein (2006) Nat. Immunol. 7:557-559\n; \nTato and O'Shea (2006) Nature 441:166-168\n; \nIwakura and Ishigame (2006) J. Clin. Invest. 116:1218-1222\n, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. \"IL-17-producing cell\" also means a T cell that expresses a gene or polypeptide of Table 10B of \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0219150\n \n (e.g., mitogen responsive P-protein; chemokine ligand 2; interleukin-17 (IL-17); transcription factor RAR related; and/or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, where expression with treatment by an IL-23 agonist is greater than treatment with an IL-12 agonist, where \"greater than\" is defined as follows. Expression with an IL-23 agonist is ordinarily at least 5-fold greater, typically at least 10-fold greater, more typically at least 15-fold greater, most typically at least 20-fold greater, preferably at least 25-fold greater, and most preferably at least 30-fold greater, than with IL-12 treatment. Expression can be measured, e.g., with treatment of a population of substantially pure IL-17 producing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, \"IL-17-producing cell\" includes a progenitor or precursor cell that is committed, in a pathway of cell development or cell differentiation, to differentiating into an IL-17-producing cell, as defined above. A progenitor or precursor cell to the IL-17 producing cell can be found in a draining lymph node (DLN). Additionally, \"IL-17-producing cell\" encompasses an IL-17-producing cell, as defined above, that has been, e.g., activated, e.g., by a phorbol ester, ionophore, and/or carcinogen, further differentiated, stored, frozen, desiccated, inactivated, partially degraded, e.g., by apoptosis, proteolysis, or lipid oxidation, or modified, e.g., by recombinant technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"isolated nucleic acid molecule\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression \"control sequences\" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions \"cell,\" \"cell line,\" and \"cell culture\" are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words \"transformants\" and \"transformed cells\" include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in, \ne.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195\n \n. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5' terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. \nSee generally\n \nMullis et al. (1987) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:263\n; \nErlich, ed., (1989) PCR TECHNOLOGY (Stockton Press, N.Y\n.) As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"germline sequence\" refers to a sequence of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA sequences. Any suitable source of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inhibitors\" and \"antagonists\" or \"activators\" and \"agonists\" refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, e.g., for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, a gene, cell, tissue, or organ. A modulator of, e.g., a gene, a receptor, a ligand, or a cell, is a molecule that alters an activity of the gene, receptor, ligand, or cell, where activity can be activated, inhibited, or altered in its regulatory properties. The modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule. Inhibitors are compounds that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a composition that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An \"agonist\" is a compound that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target An \"antagonist\" is a compound that opposes the actions of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist. An antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the extent of inhibition, for example, samples or assays comprising a given, e.g., protein, gene, cell, or organism, are treated with a potential activating or inhibiting agent and are compared to control samples without the agent. Control samples, i.e., not treated with agent, are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 90% or less, typically 85% or less, more typically 80% or less, most typically 75% or less, generally 70% or less, more generally 65% or less, most generally 60% or less, typically 55% or less, usually 50% or less, more usually 45% or less, most usually 40% or less, preferably 35% or less, more preferably 30% or less, still more preferably 25% or less, and most preferably less than 25%. Activation is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 110%, generally at least 120%, more generally at least 140%, more generally at least 160%, often at least 180%, more often at least 2-fold, most often at least 2.5-fold, usually at least 5-fold, more usually at least 10-fold, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 40-fold, and most preferably over 40-fold higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndpoints in activation or inhibition can be monitored as follows. Activation, inhibition, and response to treatment, e.g., of a cell, physiological fluid, tissue, organ, and animal or human subject, can be monitored by an endpoint. The endpoint may comprise a predetermined quantity or percentage of, e.g., an indicia of inflammation, oncogenicity, or cell degranulation or secretion, such as the release of a cytokine, toxic oxygen, or a protease. The endpoint may comprise, e.g., a predetermined quantity of ion flux or transport; cell migration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; potential for metastasis; cell differentiation; and change in phenotype, e.g., change in expression of gene relating to inflammation, apoptosis, transformation, cell cycle, or metastasis (see, e.g., \nKnight (2000) Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 30:145-158\n; \nHood and Cheresh (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:91-100\n \n;\n \nTimme, et al. (2003) Curr. Drug Targets 4:251-261\n; \nRobbins and Itzkowitz (2002) Med. Clin. North Am. 86:1467-1495\n; \nGrady and Markowitz (2002) Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 3:101-128\n; \nBauer, et al. (2001) Glia 36:235-243\n; \nStanimirovic and Satoh (2000) Brain Pathol. 10:113-126\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn endpoint of inhibition is generally 75% of the control or less, preferably 50% of the control or less, more preferably 25% of the control or less, and most preferably 10% of the control or less. Generally, an endpoint of activation is at least 150% the control, preferably at least two times the control, more preferably at least four times the control, and most preferably at least 10 times the control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Ligand\" refers, e.g., to a small molecule, peptide, polypeptide, and membrane associated or membrane-bound molecule, or complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. \"Ligand\" also encompasses an agent that is not an agonist or antagonist, but that can bind to the receptor. Moreover, \"ligand\" includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed, e.g., by chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. By convention, where a ligand is membrane-bound on a first cell, the receptor usually occurs on a second cell. The second cell may have the same or a different identity as the first cell. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The ligand or receptor may change its location, e.g., from an intracellular compartment to the outer face of the plasma membrane. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a \"ligand receptor complex.\" Where a ligand and receptor are involved in a signaling pathway, the ligand occurs at an upstream position and the receptor occurs at a downstream position of the signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Small molecules\" are provided for the treatment of physiology and disorders of the hair follicle. \"Small molecule\" is defined as a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kD, typically less than 2 kD, and preferably less than 1 kD. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. As a therapeutic, a small molecule may be more permeable to cells, less susceptible to degradation, and less apt to elicit an immune response than large molecules. Small molecules, such as peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines, as well as small molecule toxins are described (see, e.g., \nCasset, et al. (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 307:198-205\n; \nMuyldermans (2001) J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302\n; \nLi (2000) Nat. Biotechnol. 18:1251-1256\n; \nApostolopoulos, et al. (2002) Curr. Med. Chem. 9:411-420\n; \nMonfardini, et al. (2002) Curr. Pharm. Des. 8:2185-2199\n; \nDomingues, et al. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6:652-656\n; \nSato and Sone (2003) Biochem. J. 371:603-608\n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al\n \n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Specifically\" or \"selectively\" binds, when referring to a ligand/receptor, antibody/antigen, or other binding pair, indicates a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody, or binding composition derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, preferably at least ten times greater, more preferably at least 20-times greater, and most preferably at least 100-times greater than the affinity with unrelated antigens. In a preferred embodiment the antibody will have an affinity that is greater than about 10\n9\n liters/mol, as determined, e.g., by Scatchard analysis (\nMunsen, et al. (1980) Analyt. Biochem. 107:220-239\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"immunomodulatory agent\" refers to natural or synthetic agents that suppress or modulate an immune response. The immune response can be a humoral or cellular response. Immunomodulatory agents encompass immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immunosuppressive agents,\" \"immunosuppressive drugs,\" or \"immunosuppressants\" as used herein are therapeutics that are used in immunosuppressive therapy to inhibit or prevent activity of the immune system. Clinically they are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g. bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver), and/or in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis). Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified into four groups: glucocorticoids cytostatics; antibodies (including Biological Response Modifiers or DMARDs); drugs acting on immunophilins; other drugs, including known chemotherpeutic agents used in the treatment of proliferative disorders. For multiple sclerosis, in particular, the antibodies of the present invention can be administered in conjunction with a new class of myelin binding protein-like therapeutics, known as copaxones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Anti-inflammatory agents\" or \"anti-inflammatory drugs\", is used to represent both steroidal and non-steroidal therapeutics. Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, are drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by adrenal glands. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as: Systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels); and Myositis (inflammation of muscle). Steroids might also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as: rheumatoid arthritis (chronic inflammatory arthritis occurring in joints on both sides of the body); systemic lupus erythematosus (a generalized disease caused by abnormal immune system function); Sjögren's syndrome (chronic disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, usually abbreviated to NSAIDs, are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects - they reduce pain, fever and inflammation. The term \"non-steroidal\" is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (amongst a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome); acute gout ; dysmenorrhoea; metastatic bone pain; headache and migraine; postoperative pain ; mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury; pyrexia; and renal colic. NSAIDs include salicylates, arlyalknoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids (profens), N-arylanthranilic acids (fenamic acids), oxicams, coxibs, and sulphonanilides.\n\n\n \nII. General\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides engineered anti-IL-23 antibodies and uses thereof to treat inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of cytokines have a role in the pathology or repair of neurological disorders. IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been associated with multiple sclerosis (\nMatusevicius, et al. (1999) Multiple Sclerosis 5:101-104\n; \nLock, et al. (2002) Nature Med. 8:500-508\n). IL-1 alpha, IL-1beta, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in ALS, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (\nHoozemans, et al. (2001) Exp. Gerontol. 36:559-570\n; \nGriffin and Mrak (2002) J. Leukocyte Biol. 72:233-238\n; \nIlzecka, et al. (2002) Cytokine 20:239-243\n). TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and IL-17 appear to modulate response to brain ischemia (see, e.g., \nKostulas, et al. (1999) Stroke 30:2174-2179\n; \nLi, et al. (2001) J. Neuroimmunol. 116:5-14\n). Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is associated with ALS (\nCleveland and Rothstein (2001) Nature 2:806-819\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory bowel disorders, e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome, are mediated by cells of the immune system and by cytokines. For example, Crohn's disease is associated with increased IL-12 and IFNγ, while ulcerative colitis is associated with increased IL-5, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). IL-17 expression may also increase in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (see, e.g., \nPodolsky (2002) New Engl. J. Med. 347:417-429\n; \nBouma and Strober (2003) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 3:521-533\n; \nBhan, et al. (1999) Immunol. Rev. 169:195-207\n; \nHanauer (1996) New Engl. J. Med. 334:841-848\n; \nGreen (2003) The Lancet 362:383-391\n; \nMcManus (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:2573-2574\n; \nHorwitz and Fisher (2001) New Engl. J. Med. 344:1846-1850\n; \nAndoh, et al. (2002) Int. J. Mol. Med. 10:631-634\n; \nNielsen, et al. (2003) Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 38:180-185\n; \nFujino, et al. (2003) Gut 52:65-70\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory diseases of the skin, joints, CNS, as well as proliferative disorders elicit similar immune responses, thus IL-23 blockade should provide inhibition of these immune mediated inflammatory disorders, without comprising the host ability to fight systemic infections. Antagonizing IL-23 should relieve the inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, Ulcerative Colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Use of IL-23 inhibitors will also provide inhibition of proliferative disorders, e.g., cancer and autoimmune disorders e.g., multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and SLE. Descriptions of IL-23 in these various disorders can be found in the following published PCT applications: \n \nWO 04/081190\n \n; \n \nWO 04/071517\n \n; \n \nWO 00/53631\n \n; and \n \nWO 01/18051\n \n, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe p19 subunit of IL-23 is a member of the 'long chain' family of hematopoietic cytokines (Oppmann \net al.\n (2000) \nsupra\n) and comprises four packed α-helices termed A, B, C and D, with an up-up-down-down topology. The 4 helices are connected by 3 polypeptide loops. The A-B and C-D loops are modeled to be relatively long as they connect parallel helices. The short B-C loop connects the antiparallel B and C helices. The p19 subunit of IL-23 is a member of the IL-6 family of helical cytokines. This family of cytokines bind to their cognate receptors through three conserved epitopes (site I, II and III; \nBravo and Heath (2000) EMBO J. 19:2399-2411\n). The p19 subunit interacts with three cytokine receptor subunits to form the competent signaling complex. When expressed in a cell, the p 19 subunit first form a complex with the p40 subunit, which it shares with IL-12. As noted above, the p19p40 complex is secreted from the cell as a heterodimeric protein and is called IL-23 (See, e.g., Oppmann \net al., supra\n). The cellular receptor complex required to transduce the IL-23 signal consists of two members of the tall signaling receptor subunits of the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines, the IL-23-specific IL-23R (see, e.g., Parham et al. \nsupra\n) and the IL-12Rb1, that is shared with IL-12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsights into the structural basis of 'long chain' cytokine/receptor recognition have shown that although large areas of protein surface are buried in formation of cytokine - receptor complexes, the affinity of the interaction is dominated by a few, often tightly clustered amino acid residues forming an energetic 'hot spot' in the center of the binding interface. The identity of the residues that dominate the binding energy of a large protein-protein interface has been termed the 'functional epitope'. The affinity of the interaction (and hence biological specificity) is consequently defined by the structural complementarity of the functional epitopes of ligand and receptor. Detailed mutagenesis studies have shown that the most significant residues that make up the functional epitopes of cytokines and receptors are hydrophobic contacts involving either non-polar side chains such as tryptophan, the aliphatic components of non-polar side chains or the polypeptide backbone. The non-polar 'core' is surrounded by a halo of polar residues of lesser importance for binding energy. Kinetic studies indicate that the primary role of the functional epitopes is to stabilize protein-protein interaction by decreasing the dissociation rate of the complex. It has been suggested that the initial contact between cytokine and receptor is dominated by random diffusion or 'rolling' of protein surfaces producing many unstable contacts. The complex is then stabilized when the functional epitopes of the receptor and ligand engage (see, e.g., Bravo and Heath, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \nIII. Generation of IL-23 Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable method for generating monoclonal antibodies may be used. For example, a recipient may be immunized with a linked or unlinked (e.g. naturally occurring) form of the IL-23 heterodimer, or a fragment thereof. Any suitable method of immunization can be used. Such methods can include adjuvants, other immunostimulants, repeated booster immunizations, and the use of one or more immunization routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable source of IL-23 can be used as the immunogen for the generation of the non-human antibody, specific for the p 19 subunit, of the compositions and methods disclosed herein. Such forms include, but are not limited whole protein, including linked and naturally occurring heterodimers, peptide(s), and epitopes, generated through recombinant, synthetic, chemical or enzymatic degradation means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny form of the antigen can be used to generate the antibody that is sufficient to generate a biologically active antibody. Thus, the eliciting antigen may be a single epitope, multiple epitopes, or the entire protein alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The eliciting antigen may be an isolated full-length protein, a cell surface protein (e.g., immunizing with cells transfected with at least a portion of the antigen), or a soluble protein (e.g., immunizing with only the extracellular domain portion of the protein). The antigen may be produced in a genetically modified cell. The DNA encoding the antigen may genomic or non-genomic (e.g., cDNA) and encodes at least a portion of the extracellular domain. As used herein, the term \"portion\" refers to the minimal number of amino acids or nucleic acids, as appropriate, to constitute an immunogenic epitope of the antigen of interest. Any genetic vectors suitable for transformation of the cells of interest may be employed, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method can be used to elicit an antibody with the desired biologic properties to inhibit IL-23. It is desirable to prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from various mammalian hosts, such as mice, rodents, primates, humans, etc. Description of techniques for preparing such monoclonal antibodies may be found in, e.g., \nStites, et al. (eds.) BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY (4th ed.) Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, CA\n, and references cited therein; \nHarlow and Lane (1988) ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL CSH Press\n; \nGoding (1986) MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (2d ed.) Academic Press, New York, NY\n. Thus, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by a variety of techniques familiar to researchers skilled in the art. Typically, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen are immortalized, commonly by fusion with a myeloma cell. \nSee\n \nKohler and Milstein (1976) Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511-519\n. Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods known in the \nart. See, e.g\n., \nDoyle, et al. (eds. 1994 and periodic supplements) CELL AND TISSUE CULTURE: LABORATORY PROCEDURES, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY\n. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen, and yield of the monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host. Alternatively, one may isolate DNA sequences which encode a monoclonal antibody or a binding fragment thereof by screening a DNA library from human B cells according, e.g., to the general protocol outlined by \nHuse, et al. (1989) Science 246:1275-1281\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable techniques involve selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. \nSee\n, \ne.g\n., \nHuse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989\n); and \nWard et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989\n). The polypeptides and antibodies of the present invention may be used with or without modification, including chimeric or humanized antibodies. Frequently, the polypeptides and antibodies will be labeled by joining, either covalently or non-covalently, a substance which provides for a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,837\n \n; \n \n3,850,752\n \n; \n \n3,939,350\n \n; \n \n3,996,345\n \n; \n \n4,277,437\n \n; \n \n4,275,149\n \n; and \n \n4,366,241\n \n. Also, recombinant immunoglobulins maybe produced, \nsee\n \n \nCabilly U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nQueen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033\n; or made in transgenic mice, see \nMendez et al. (1997) Nature Genetics 15:146-156\n; also see Abgenix and Medarex technologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or binding compositions against predetermined fragments of IL-23 can be raised by immunization of animals with conjugates of the polypeptide, fragments, peptides, or epitopes with carrier proteins. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared from cells secreting the desired antibody. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective IL-23. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a K\nd\n of about 1 µM, more usually at least about 300 nM, typically at least about 30 nM, preferably at least about 10 nM, more preferably at least about 3 nM or better, usually determined by ELISA. Suitable non-human antibodies may also be identified using the biologic assays described in Example 5, below.\n\n\n \nIV. Humanization of IL-23 Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable non-human antibody can be used as a source for the hypervariable region. Sources for non-human antibodies include, but are not limited to, murine, Lagomorphs (including rabbits), bovine, and primates. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance of the desired biological activity. For further details, see \nJones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522-525\n; \nReichmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-329\n; and \nPresta (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for recombinantly engineering antibodies have been described, e.g., by \n \nBoss et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397\n \n), \n \nCabilly et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n), Law et al. (European Patent Application Publication No.\n \n 438 310\n \n) and Winter (European Patent Application Publication No. \n \n239400\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence variants of humanized anti-IL-23 antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Such variants include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences shown for the humanized anti-IL-23 F(ab) (e.g. as in SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2). Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody polypeptide that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis,\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells (1989) Science 244: 1081-1085\n. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified \n(e.g.,\n charged residues such as Arg, Asp, His, Lys, and Glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with IL-23 antigen. The amino acid residues demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation \nper se\n need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, Ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include humanized anti-IL-23 antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of humanized anti-IL-23 antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable loops, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Hypervariable region residues or FR residues involved in antigen binding are generally substituted in a relatively conservative manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another type of amino acid variant is the substitution of residues to provide for greater chemical stability of the final humanized antibody. For example, an asparagine (N) residue may be changed to reduce the potential for formation of isoaspartate at any NG sequences within a rodent CDR. In one embodiment, the asparagine is changed to glutamine (Q). Isoaspartate formation may debilitate or completely abrogate binding of an antibody to its target antigen. \nPresta (2005) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 116:731 at 734\n. In addition, methionine residues in rodent CDRs may be changed to reduce the possibility that the methionine sulfur would oxidize, which could reduce antigen binding affinity and also contribute to molecular heterogeneity in the final antibody preparation. \nId.\n In one embodiment, the methionine is changed to alanine (A). Antibodies with such substitutions are subsequently screened to ensure that the substitutions do not decrease IL-23p19 binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of humanized IL-23 specific antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, amino acid sequence variants of the humanized anti-II-23 antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the original humanized antibody amino acid sequences of either the heavy or the light chain more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the humanized anti-IL-23 residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. None ofN-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE. Preferably, the antibody is an IgG antibody. Any isotype of IgG can be used, including IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, and IgG\n4\n. Variants of the IgG isotypes are also contemplated. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype. Optimization of the necessary constant domain sequences to generate the desired biologic activity is readily achieved by screening the antibodies in the biological assays described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, either class of light chain can be used in the compositions and methods herein. Specifically, kappa, lambda, or variants thereof are useful in the present compositions and methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the CDR sequences from the non-human antibody can be used. The CDR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the CDR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the non-human CDR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the FR sequences from the human antibody can be used. The FR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the FR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the human FR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDR and FR residues are determined according to the standard sequence definition of Kabat. \nKabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md. (1987\n). SEQ ID NOs: 5 ― 16 and 31 ― 48 show the heavy chain variable domain sequences of various mouse anti-human IL-23p19 antibodies, and SEQ ID NOs: 17 ― 28 and 49 ― 65 depict the light chain variable domain sequences. SEQ ID NOs: 66 ― 68 are consensus sequences for heavy chain CDRs (CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3), and are comprised of the most common amino acid residue at each position in the heavy chain CDRs for the family of antibodies consisting of 7G10, 6H12, 13F11, 13B5, 7E2, 13G1, 11C10,1E10, 30F11, 34E4, SB12, 6H4, 9C9, 11B10, 30E1, 33D2, 20A9, 22E9, 29D5, 21A10 and 33B12. \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n provide a sequence lineup of heavy chains of various antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 2A-2C\n, the light chain CDRs of the antibodies of the present invention disclosed herein are grouped into three subfamilies, referred to as (a), (b) and (c). Light chain subfamily (a) consists of antibodies 7G10, 6H12, 13F11, 13B5, 7E2, 13G1, 11C10, 30F11, 34E4, 6H4, 33D2 and 33B12. Light chain subfamily (b) consists of antibodies 1E10, 20A9, 22E9, 29D5, SB12, 9C9 and 11B10. Light chain subfamily (c) consists of antibodies 10H11, 19E9, 10G8, 39G2, 35F12, 49A10, 34F9 and 7D7. These light chain subfamilies were used to derive consensus CDR sequences of CDRL1(a), CDRL1(b) and CDRL1(c) (SEQ ID NOs: 69 ― 71) and corresponding consensus sequences CDRL2 (SEQ ID NOs: 72 ― 74) and CDRL3 (SEQ ID NOs: 75 ― 77) for each subfamily. Consensus sequences for light chain CDRs are comprised of the most common amino acid residue at each position in the light chain CDRs for each subfamily of antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 2 and 3 define various domains of humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies 6H12, 7G10, 10H11and 22E9, as well as and the light and heavy chain variable domains of several murine antibodies of the present invention. Residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NOs: 1- 4 represent signal sequences for heavy and light strands of hum6H12 and hum7G10. Light chain constant domains of hum6H12 and hum7G10 are at residues 130-233 of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4, respectively. Heavy chain constant domains of hum6H12 and hum 7G10 are at residues 135-464 of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3, respectively, with CH1 at residues 135-242, CH2+hinge at residues 243-357 and CH3 at residues 358-464. All other antibodies are presented as light and heavy chain variable regions (V\nL\n and V\nH\n), and thus lack signal sequences and constant domains.\n\n \nTable 2\n \n \n \nLight Chain Sequences and

amino acids at certain positions. In one embodiment antibodies of the present invention, or binding fragments thereof, comprise the \"CDR Variable\" domains listed at SEQ ID NOs: 78 - 89. These \"CDR Variable\" sequences include the consensus sequence of each family of related antibodies as well as variable positions encompassing all observed sequence variants within that family. Such sequence variants are displayed in \nFIGS. 1A\n ― 1C and 2A ― 2C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the variable amino acids in potential CDRs are selected from those amino acids appearing two or more times in the families reported herein. These antibodies are a subset of the \"CDR Variable\" antibodies described above in which amino acids that appear only once at a given position in a CDR in a given family of sequences are not included in the pool of potential CDRs. These \"single occurrence\" amino acid substitutions are readily determined, and thus excluded from the \"CDR Variable\" sequences, by simple inspection of \nFIGS. 1A\n ― 1C and 2A ― 2C. This narrowed range of potential CDR sequences is referred to herein as a \"multiple occurrence variable CDR.\" This nomenclature is used herein for convenience in referring to this subset of the \"CDR Variable\" sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, potential CDRs are not limited to the \"CDR Variable\" sequences described above, but also include conservatively modified variants of any observed amino acid, as determined using the data of Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, potential CDRs include variants of any single sequence CDR disclosed herein, including consensus sequences SEQ ID NOs: 66 - 77, in which the variant comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the disclosed sequence, as determined using the data of Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated are chimeric antibodies. As noted above, typical chimeric antibodies comprise a portion of the heavy and/or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are also useful in the present methods and compositions. As used herein, the term \"bispecific antibody\" refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes, e.g., IL-23p19 and IL-23p40. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain pairs. \nSee, e.g.\n, \nMilstein et al. (1983) Nature 305: 537-39\n. Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. \nSee\n, \ne.g\n., \nBrennan, et al. (1985) Science 229: 81\n. Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. \nSee\n, \ne.g\n., \nHollinger, et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90: 6444-48\n, \nGruber, et al., J. Immunol. 152: 5368 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, different constant domains may be appended to the humanized V\nL\n and V\nH\n regions provided herein. For example, if a particular intended use of an antibody (or fragment) of the present invention were to call for altered effector functions, a heavy chain constant domain other than IgG1 may be used. Although IgG1 antibodies provide for long half-life and for effector functions, such as complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, such activities may not be desirable for all uses of the antibody. In such instances an IgG4 constant domain, for example, may be used.\n\n\n \nV. Biological Activity of Humanized Anti-IL-23\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies having the characteristics identified herein as being desirable in a humanized anti-IL-23 antibody can be screened for inhibitory biologic activity \nin vitro\n or suitable binding affinity. To screen for antibodies that bind to the epitope on human IL-23 (i.e. the p19 subunit) bound by an antibody of interest (e.g., those which block binding of the cytokine to its receptor), a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nANTIBODIES, A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n), can be performed. Antibodies that bind to the same epitope are likely to cross-block in such assays, but not all cross-blocking antibodies will necessarily bind at precisely the same epitope since cross-blocking may result from steric hindrance of antibody binding by antibodies bound at nearby, or even overlapping, epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, epitope mapping, \ne.g\n., as described in \nChampe et al. (1995) J. Biol.Chem. 270:1388-1394\n, can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest. \"Alanine scanning mutagenesis,\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells (1989) Science 244: 1081-1085\n, or some other form of point mutagenesis of amino acid residues in human IL-23 may also be used to determine the functional epitope for an anti-IL-23 antibody of the present invention. Mutagenesis studies, however, may also reveal amino acid residues that are crucial to the overall three-dimensional structure of IL-23 but that are not directly involved in antibody-antigen contacts, and thus other methods may be necessary to confirm a functional epitope determined using this method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitope bound by a specific antibody may also be determined by assessing binding of the antibody to peptides comprising fragments of human IL-23p19 (SEQ ID NO: 39). A series of overlapping peptides encompassing the sequence of IL-23p19 may be synthesized and screened for binding, e.g. in a direct ELISA, a competitive ELISA (where the peptide is assessed for its ability to prevent binding of an antibody to IL-23p19 bound to a well of a microtiter plate), or on a chip. Such peptide screening methods may not be capable of detecting some discontinuous functional epitopes, i.e. functional epitopes that involve amino acid residues that are not contiguous along the primary sequence of the IL-23p19 polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitope bound by antibodies of the present invention may also be determined by structural methods, such as X-ray crystal structure determination (e.g., \n \nWO2005/044853\n \n), molecular modeling and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, including NMR determination of the H―D exchange rates of labile amide hydrogens in IL-23 when free and when bound in a complex with an antibody of interest (\nZinn-Justin et al (1992) Biochemistry 31, 11335-11347\n; \nZinn-Justin et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6884-6891\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to X-ray crystallography, crystallization may be accomplished using any of the known methods in the art (\ne.g.\n \nGiege et al. (1994) Acta Crystallogr. D50:339-350\n; \nMcPherson (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 189:1-23\n), including microbatch \n(e.g.\n \nChayen (1997) Structure 5:1269-1274\n), hanging-drop vapor diffusion (\ne.g.\n \nMcPherson (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251:6300 -6303\n), seeding and dialysis. It is desirable to use a protein preparation having a concentration of at least about 1 mg/mL and preferably about 10 mg/mL to about 20 mg/mL. Crystallization may be best achieved in a precipitant solution containing polyethylene glycol 1000-20,000 (PEG; average molecular weight ranging from about 1000 to about 20,000 Da), preferably about 5000 to about 7000 Da, more preferably about 6000 Da, with concentrations ranging from about 10% to about 30% (w/v). It may also be desirable to include a protein stabilizing agent, e.g. glycerol at a concentration ranging from about 0.5% to about 20%. A suitable salt, such as sodium chloride, lithium chloride or sodium citrate may also be desirable in the precipitant solution, preferably in a concentration ranging from about 1 mM to about 1000 mM. The precipitant is preferably buffered to a pH of from about 3.0 to about 5.0, preferably about 4.0. Specific buffers useful in the precipitant solution may vary and are well-known in the art (Scopes, Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, Third ed., (1994) Springer-Verlag, New York). Examples of useful buffers include, but are not limited to, HEPES, Tris, MES and acetate. Crystals may be grow at a wide range of temperatures, including 2°C, 4°C, 8°C and 26°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody:antigen crystals may be studied using well-known X-ray diffraction techniques and may be refined using computer software such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.; \nsee e.g.\n \nBlundell & Johnson (1985) Meth. Enzymol. 114 & 115, H. W. Wyckoff et al., eds., Academic Press\n; \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0014194\n \n), and BUSTER (\nBricogne (1993) Acta Cryst. D49:37-60\n; \nBricogne (1997) Meth. Enzymol. 276A:361-423, Carter & Sweet, eds\n.; \nRoversi et al. (2000) Acta Cryst. D56:1313-1323\n), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional antibodies binding to the same epitope as an antibody of the present invention may be obtained, for example, by screening of antibodies raised against IL-23 for binding to the epitope, or by immunization of an animal with a peptide comprising a fragment of human IL-23 comprising the epitope sequence. Antibodies that bind to the same functional epitope might be expected to exhibit similar biological activities, such as blocking receptor binding, and such activities can be confirmed by functional assays of the antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody affinities (e.g. for human IL-23) may be determined using standard analysis. Preferred humanized antibodies are those which bind human IL-23p19 with a K\nD\n value of no more than about 1x10\n-7\n; preferably no more than about 1x10\n-8\n; more preferably no more than about 1x10\n-9\n; and most preferably no more than about 1x10\n-10\n M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and fragments thereof useful in the present compositions and methods are biologically active antibodies and fragments. As used herein, the term \"biologically active\" refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Typically, these effects result from the failure of IL-23 to bind its receptor. As used herein, the term \"specific\" refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to IL-23 to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. If the antibody binds to IL-23 at least 10, and preferably 50 times more than to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture then it is considered to be specific. An antibody that \"specifically binds\" to IL-23 does not bind to proteins that do not comprise the II-23-derived sequences, i.e. \"specificity\" as used herein relates to IL-23 specificity, and not any other sequences that may be present in the protein in question. For example, as used herein, an antibody that \"specifically binds\" to IL-23 will typically bind to FLAG-hIL-23, which is a fusion protein comprising IL-23 and a FLAG\n®\n peptide tag, but it does not bind to the FLAG\n®\n peptide tag alone or when it is fused to a protein other than IL-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-23-specific binding compounds of the present invention, such as inhibitory II-23p19 specific antibodies, can inhibit its biological activity in any manner, including but not limited to production of IL-1β and TNF by peritoneal macrophages and IL-17 by T\nH\n17 T cells (see \nLangrish et al. (2004) Immunol. Rev. 202:96-105\n). Anti-IL-23p19 antibodies will also be able to inhibit the gene expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, CCL7, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCR1, and GM-CSF (see \nLangrish et al. (2005) J. Exp. Med. 201:233-240\n). IL-23-specific binding compounds of the present invention, such as anti IL-23p19 antibodies, will also block the ability of IL-23 to enhance proliferation or survival of T\nH\n17 cells. \nCua and Kastelein (2006) Nat. Immunol. 7:557-559\n. The inhibitory activity of engineered anti-IL-23p19 will be useful in the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders. Such disorders are described in PCT patent application publications \n \nWO 04/081190\n \n; \n \nWO 04/071517\n \n; \n \nWO 00/53631\n \n; and \n \nWO 01/18051\n \n, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nVI. Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions including an agonist or antagonist of IL-23, the cytokine analogue or mutein, antibody thereto, or nucleic acid thereof, is admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, see, e.g., \nRentington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and U.S. Pharmacopeia: National Formulary, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1984\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents may be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized powders, slurries, aqueous solutions or suspensions (see, e.g., \nHardman, et al. (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY\n; \nGennaro (2000) Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, New York, NY\n; \nAvis, et al. (eds.) (1993) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications, Marcel Dekker, NY\n; \nLieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Marcel Dekker, NY\n; \nLieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, Marcel Dekker, NY\n; \nWeiner and Kotkoskie (2000) Excipient Toxicity and Safety, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[0100] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody compositions, administered alone or in combination with an immunosuppressive agent, can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, \ne.g\n., for determining the LD\n50\n (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50\n (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50\n and ED\n50\n. Antibodies exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50\n with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mode of administration is not particularly important. Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Administration of antibody used in the pharmaceutical composition or to practice the method of the present invention can be carried out in a variety of conventional ways, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, topical application or cutaneous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intraarterial or intravenous injection. Intravenous administration to the patient is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternately, one may administer the antibody in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody directly into an arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelecting an administration regimen for a therapeutic depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the entity, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the entity, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, an administration regimen maximizes the amount of therapeutic delivered to the patient consistent with an acceptable level of side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular entity and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of antibodies, cytokines, and small molecules are available (see, e.g., \nWawrzynczak (1996) Antibody Therapy, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK\n; \nKresina (ed.) (1991) Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis, Marcel Dekker, New York, NY\n; \nBach (ed.) (1993) Monoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases, Marcel Dekker, New York, NY\n; \nBaert, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:601-608\n; \nMilgrom, et al. (1999) New Engl. J. Med. 341:1966-1973\n; \nSlamon, et al. (2001) New Engl. J. Med. 344:783-792\n; \nBeniaminovitz, et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 342:613-619\n; \nGhosh, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:24-32\n; \nLipsky, et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 343:1594-1602\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[0104] Determination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing an inflammatory, autoimmune, or proliferative response to the reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies, antibody fragments, and cytokines can be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses at intervals of, e.g., one day, one week, or 1-7 times per week. Doses may be provided intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, intraspinally, or by inhalation. A preferred dose protocol is one involving the maximal dose or \ndose\n frequency that avoids significant undesirable side effects. A total weekly dose is generally at least 0.05 µg/kg body weight, more generally at least 0.2 µg/kg, most generally at least 0.5 µg/kg, typically at least 1 µg/kg, more typically at least 10 µg/kg, most typically at least 100 µg/kg, preferably at least 0.2 mg/kg, more preferably at least 1.0 mg/kg, most preferably at least 2.0 mg/kg, optimally at least 10 mg/kg, more optimally at least 25 mglkg, and most optimally at least 50 mg/kg (see, e.g., \nYang, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 349:427-434\n; \nHerold, et al. (2002) New Engl. J. Med. 346:1692-1698\n; \nLiu, et al. (1999) J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. 67:451-456\n; \nPortielji, et al. (20003) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 52:133-144\n). The desired dose of a small molecule therapeutic, e.g., a peptide mimetic, natural product, or organic chemical, is about the same as for an antibody or polypeptide, on a moles/kg basis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"inhibit\" or \"treat\" or \"treatment\" includes a postponement of development of the symptoms associated with autoimmune disease or pathogen-induced immunopathology and/or a reduction in the severity of such symptoms that will or are expected to develop. The terms further include ameliorating existing uncontrolled or unwanted autoimmune-related or pathogen-induced immunopathology symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, and ameliorating or preventing the underlying causes of such symptoms. Thus, the terms denote that a beneficial result has been conferred on a vertebrate subject with an autoimmune or pathogen-induced immunopathology disease or symptom, or with the potential to develop such a disease or symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" or \"effective amount\" refers to an amount of an IL-23p19 specific binding compound, e.g. and antibody, that when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a cell, tissue, or subject is effective to prevent or ameliorate the autoimmune disease or pathogen-induced immunopathology associated disease or condition or the progression of the disease. A therapeutically effective dose further refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms, \ne.g\n., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. An effective amount of therapeutic will decrease the symptoms typically by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for co-administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., a cytokine, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, or radiation, are well known in the art, see, e.g., \nHardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY\n; \nPoole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA\n; \nChabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA\n. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain other immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents. Any suitable immunosuppressive agent can be employed, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (i.e., FK-506), sirolimus, interferons, soluble cytokine receptors (\ne.g\n., sTNRF and sIL-1R), agents that neutralize cytokine activity (\ne.g.,\n inflixmab, etanercept), mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, thalidomide, glatiramer, azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition can also be employed with other therapeutic modalities such as phototherapy and radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical veterinary, experimental, or research subjects include monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, horses, and humans.\n\n\n \nVII. Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of the antibodies of the present invention, the nucleic acids encoding the two chains are isolated and inserted into one or more replicable vectors for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. In one embodiment, both the light and heavy chains of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody of the present invention are expressed from the same vector, e.g. a plasmid or an adenoviral vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be produced by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, antibodies are expressed in mammalian or insect cells in culture, such as chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, mouse myeloma NSO cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, \nSpodoptera frugiperda\n ovarian (Sf9) cells. In one embodiment, antibodies secreted from CHO cells are recovered and purified by standard chromatographic methods, such as protein A, cation exchange, anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Resulting antibodies are concentrated and stored in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are produced in yeast according to the methods described in \n \nWO2005/040395\n \n. Briefly, vectors encoding the individual light or heavy chains of an antibody of interest are introduced into different yeast haploid cells, e.g. different mating types of the yeast \nPichia pastoris\n, which yeast haploid cells are optionally complementary auxotrophs. The transformed haploid yeast cells can then be mated or fused to give a diploid yeast cell capable of producing both the heavy and the light chains. The diploid strain is then able to secret the fully assembled and biologically active antibody. The relative expression levels of the two chains can be optimized, for example, by using vectors with different copy number, using transcriptional promoters of different strengths, or inducing expression from inducible promoters driving transcription of the genes encoding one or both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[0113] In one embodiment, the respective heavy and light chains of a plurality of different anti-IL-23p19 antibodies (the \"original\" antibodies) are introduced into yeast haploid cells to create a library of haploid yeast strains of one mating type expressing a plurality of light chains, and a library of haploid yeast strains of a different mating type expressing a plurality of heavy chains. These libraries of haploid strains can be mated (or fused as spheroplasts) to produce a series of diploid yeast cells expressing a combinatorial library of antibodies comprised of the various possible permutations of light and heavy chains. The combinatorial library of antibodies can then be screened to determine whether any of the antibodies has properties that are superior (e.g. higher affinity for IL-23) to those of the original antibodies. See. e.g., \n \nWO2005/040395\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention are human domain antibodies in which portions of an antibody variable domain are linked in a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 13 kDa. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. Publication No. 2004/0110941\n \n. Such single domain, low molecular weight agents provide numerous advantages in terms of ease of synthesis, stability, and route of administration.\n\n\n \nVIII. Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for using engineered anti-IL-23 for the treatment and diagnosis of inflammatory disorders and conditions, e.g., of the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as autoimmune and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods are provided for the treatment of, e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), including relapsing-remitting MS and primary progressive MS, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a.k.a. ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease), ischemic brain injury, prion diseases, and HIV-associated dementia. Also provided are methods for treating neuropathic pain, posttraumatic neuropathies, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), peripheral polyneuropathy, and nerve regeneration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided are methods for treating or ameliorating one or more of the following features, symptoms, aspects, manifestations, or signs of multiple sclerosis, or other inflammatory disorder or condition of the nervous system: brain lesions, myelin lesions, demyelination, demyelinated plaques, visual disturbance, loss of balance or coordination, spasticity, sensory disturbances, incontinence, pain, weakness, fatigue, paralysis, cognitive impairment, bradyphrenia, diplopia, optic neuritis, paresthesia, gait ataxia, fatigue, Uhtoff's symptom, neuralgia, aphasia, apraxia, seizures, visual-field loss, dementia, extrapyramidal phenomena, depression, sense of well-being, or other emotional symptoms, chronic progressive myelopathy, and a symptom detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including gadolinium-enhancing lesions, evoked potential recordings, or examination of cerebrospinal fluid (see, e.g., \nKenealy et al. (2003) J. Neuroimmunol. 143:7-12\n; \nNoseworthy et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 343:938-952\n; \nMiller et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:15-23\n; \nChang et al. (2002) New Engl. J. Med 346:165-173\n; \nBruck and Stadelmann (2003) Neurol. Sci. 24 Suppl.5:S265-S267\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the present invention provides methods for treating and diagnosing inflammatory bowel disorders, e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Provides are methods for treating or ameliorating one or more of the following symptoms, aspects, manifestations, or signs of an inflammatory bowel disorder: malabsorption of food, altered bowel motility, infection, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, signs of malnutrition, perianal disease, abdominal mass, and growth failure, as well as intestinal complications such as stricture, fistulas, toxic megacolon, perforation, and cancer, and including endoscopic findings, such as, friability, aphthous and linear ulcers, cobblestone appearance, pseudopolyps, and rectal involvement and, in addition, anti-yeast antibodies (see, e.g., Podolsky, \nsupra\n; Hanauer, \nsupra\n; Horwitz and Fisher, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated is treatment of inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and type I diabetes, and proliferative disorders such as cancer (see, e.g., PCT patent applications \n \nWO 04/081190\n \n; \n \nWO 04/071517\n \n; \n \nWO 00/53631\n \n; and \n \nWO 01/18051\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-23p19 binding compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with one or more antagonists of other cytokines (e.g. antibodies), including but not limited to, IL-17A, IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β. See, e.g., \nVeldhoen (2006) Immunity 24:179-189\n; \nDong (2006) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 6(4):329-333\n. In various embodiments, an IL-23p19 binding compound of the invention is administered before, concurrently with, or after administration of the another antagonist or antagonists, such as an anti-IL-17A antibody. In one embodiment, an IL-17A binding compound is used in treatment of the acute early phase of an adverse immune response (e.g. MS, Crohn's Disease) alone or in combination with an IL-23 antagonist antibody of the present invention. In the latter case, the IL-17A binding compound may be gradually decreased and treatment with the antagonist of II,-23 alone is continued to maintain suppression of the adverse response. Alternatively, antagonists to IL-1β, IL-6 and/or TGF-β may be administered concurrently, before or after an IL-23p19 binding compound of the present invention. \nSee\n \nCua and Kastelein (2006) Nat.

The VH subgroups are listed in \nM.-P. Lefranc, \"\nNomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes\n\", Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 18:100-116,2001\n. 6H12 and 7G10 antibodies scored highest against human heavy chain germline DP-14 in subgroup VH1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all non-human antibodies, the VL sequences were of the kappa subclass of VL. The amino acid sequence of the non-human VL domain was compared to a group of four human VL kappa germline amino acid sequences. The group of four is comprised of one representative from each of four established human VL subgroups listed in \nV. Barbie & M.-P. Lefranc, \"\nThe Human Immunoglobulin Kappa Variable (IGKV) Genes and Joining (IGKJ) Segments\n\", Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 15:171-183, 1998\n and \nM.-P. Lefranc, \"\nNomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Kappa (IGK) Genes\n\", Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 18:161-174, 2001\n. The four subgroups also correspond to the four subgroups listed in \nKabat et al. \"\nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n\", U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Pub. 91-3242, 5th Ed., 1991, pp. 103-130\n. 6H12 and 7G10 antibodies scored highest against human light chain germline Z-012 in subgroup VLkI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the target amino acid sequences of the variable heavy and light chains were determined, plasmids encoding the full-length humanized antibody were generated. Starting with a plasmid encoding a humanized anti-IL-10 antibody having VH3 DP-46 and VLkI Z-012 germline frameworks, the plasmids were altered using Kunkel mutagenesis (see, e.g., \nKunkel T A. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 82:488-492\n) to change the DNA sequence to the target humanized 6H12 or 7G10 sequences. Simultaneously, codon optimization was incorporated into the changes to provide for potentially optimal expression. The resulting humanized heavy and light chain sequences, including signal sequences, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 (antibody 6H12) and at SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4 (for antibody 7G10), respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analogous procedure was performed to determine the proper human frameworks for humanization of antibodies 10H11 and 22E9. Antibody 10H11 scored highest against human antibody heavy chain germline DP-46 in subgroup VH3 and light chain germline Z-A27 in subgroup VLkIII. Antibody 22E9 scored highest against human antibody heavy chain germline DP-14 in subgroup VH1 and light chain germline Z-B3 in subgroup VLkIV. The resulting humanized heavy and light chain variable domain sequences are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 90 and 91 (antibody 10H11) and at SEQ ID NOs: 92 and 93 (for antibody 22E9), respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nDetermining the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (K\nD\n) for Humanized Anti-human IL-23 Using KinExA Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nThe equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for anti human IL-23 antibodies were determined using the KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., www.sapidyne.com). KinExA uses the principle of the Kinetic Exclusion Assay method based on measuring the concentration of uncomplexed antibody in a mixture of antibody, antigen and antibody-antigen complex. The concentration of free antibody is measured by exposing the mixture to a solid-phase immobilized antigen for a very brief period of time. In practice, this is accomplished by flowing the solution phase antigen-antibody mixture past antigen-coated particles trapped in a flow cell. Data generated by the instrument are analyzed using custom software. Equilibrium constants are calculated using a mathematical theory based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n1. The binding follows the reversible binding equation for equilibrium: \n \n \n \nk\n \non\n \n \n \nAb\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nAg\n \n \n=\n \n \nk\n \noff\n \n \n \nAbAg\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n2. Antibody and antigen bind 1:1 and total antibody equals antigen-antibody complex plus free antibody.\n\n\n3. Instrument signal is linearly related to free antibody concentration.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n98 micron PMMA particles (Sapidyne, Cat No. 440198) were coated with biotinylated rhIL-23 according to Sapidyne \"Protocol for coating PMMA particles with biotinylated ligands having short or nonexistent linker arms\". For biotinylation of rhIL-23, EZ-link TFP PEO-biotin (Pierce, Cat. No. 21219) was used according to manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce bulletin 0874). All experimental procedures were done according to the KinExA 3000 manual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree forms of the heterodimeric IL-23 protein were used. Native or non-linked human IL-23 comprised of two chains, p19 and p40, that are covalently linked by a disulfide-bond. \"Non-linked\" IL-23 is comprised of human p40 coexpressed in 293T cells with human p19:FLAG-tag peptide and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified non-linked IL-23 showed presence of multimeric IL-23 forms at molecular weights corresponding to dimers, trimers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Elastikine\" IL-23 is a single-chain peptide comprised of FLAG-tag peptide:GLU-tag peptide:human p40:elasti-linker:human p19. The elasti-linker peptide sequence was derived from R&D Systems form of commercial IL-23. Elastikine was expressed in 293T cells and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified elastikine IL-23 showed presence ofmultimeric IL-23 forms at molecular weights corresponding to dimers, trimers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA non-tagged, non-linked form of native human IL-23p19/p40 coexpressed in SF9 cells was purchased from eBioscience (CAT No. 34-8239). By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified eBioscience human IL-23 did not show presence of multimeric IL-23 forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll runs were done in duplicate under the following conditions: Sample volume: 1.5 mL; Sample flow rate: 0.25 mL/min; Label volume: 0.5 mL; Label flow rate: 0.25 mL/min; mAb conc. : 0.1 nM; Highest Ag (hIL-23) conc. : 4.0 nM; Lowest Ag (hIL-23) conc. : 3.91 pM. Two-fold serial dilutions of the antigen were prepared and mixed with the antibody at constant concentration. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr at room temperature to equilibrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows the results of the KinExA analysis.\n\n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \n \nK\nD\n Values Determined by KinExa\n \n \n \nHuman IL-23\n \nAntibody\n \nK\nD\n(pM)\n \n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n6H12\n \n54,48\n \n \n \nnon-linked\n \n6H12\n \n>1200\n \n \n \neBioscience\n \n6H12\n \n>1000, >920\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \nhu6H12\n \n28,36\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n7G10\n \n41,9.2\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \nhu7G10\n \n49, 16\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n39G2\n \n19\n \n \n \nnon-linked\n \n39G2\n \n34\n \n \n \neBioscience\n \n39G2\n \n620\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n35F12\n \n53\n \n \n \neBioscience\n \n35F12\n \n>700\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n13B5\n \n22\n \n \n \neBioscience\n \n13B5\n \n55\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n7D7\n \n2.7\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n3D7\n \n0.84\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n49A10\n \n7.4\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n13F11\n \n11\n \n \n \nelastikine\n \n33B12\n \n6.8\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nDetermining the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (K\nD\n) for Humanized Anti-human IL-23p19 Antibodies Using BIAcore Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nAll ligands (anti-IL-23 mAbs) were immobilized on a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip using standard amine-coupling procedure. All experiments were carried out at 25°C and at a flow-rate of 10 µL/min in PBS. All IL-23 forms were diluted in PBS to produce various concentrations. Kinetic constants for the various interactions were determined using BIAevaluation software 3.1. The K\nD\n was determined using the calculated dissociation and association rate constants. Proteins were used at the following concentrations: anti-IL-23 mAb hu7G10 in PBS at 0.33 mg/mL; anti-IL-23 mAb hu6H12 in PBS at 0.2 mg/mL; bac-wt human IL-23 in PBS at 0.30 mg/mL; eBioscience human IL-23 in PBS at 0.10 mg/mL; N222Q human IL-23 in PBS at 0.33 mg/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the proteins noted above other forms were also used. \"Bac-wt\" human IL-23 is identical to \"elastikine\" human IL-23 in sequence. This IL-23 was expressed in SF9 cells and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified IL-23 did not show presence of multimeric IL-23 forms. \"N222Q\" human IL-23 is identical to \"elastikine\" human IL-23 in sequence except for alteration of Asn222 to Gln in the p40 subunit (GenBank Accession No. P29460). This IL-23 was expressed in SF9 cells and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified N222Q IL-23 did not show presence ofmultimeric IL-23 forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following immobilization and regeneration conditions were used for all experiments: Flow-rate: 5 µL/min; NHS/EDC: 10 µL; Protein: 5 µg/mL in 10 mM NaAcetate, pH 5.0: 10 µL; ethanolamine: 40 µL; regeneration: 5 µL of 50 mM NaOH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 5 provides the K\nD\n values as determined by BIAcore.\n\n \nTable 5\n \n \n \n \n \nK\nD\n Determination by BIAcore\n \n \n \nHuman IL-23\n \nAntibody\n \nK\nD\n(nM)\n \n \n \n \nbac-wt\n \nhu7G10\n \n10\n \n \n \nN222Q\n \nhu7G10\n \n0.3, 1.0\n \n \n \neBioscience\n \nhu7G10\n \n3.2, 9.0\n \n \n \nbac-wt\n \nhu6H12\n \n5.1\n \n \n \nN222Q\n \nhu6H12\n \n0.5\n \n \n \neBioscience\n \nhu6H12\n \n4.1\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nProliferation Bioassays for the Assessment of Neutralizing Anti-IL-23 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a monoclonal antibody to biologically neutralize IL-23 was assessed by the application of short-term proliferation bioassays that employ cells that express recombinant IL-23 receptors. The transfectant Ba/F3-2.2lo cells proliferate in response to human IL-23 and the response can be inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IL-23 antibody. An antibody is titrated against a concentration of IL-23 chosen within the linear region of the dose-response curve, near plateau and above EC50. Proliferation, or lack thereof, is measured by colorimetric means using Alamar Blue, a growth indicator dye based on detection of metabolic activity. The ability of an antibody to neutralize IL-23 is assessed by its IC50 value, or concentration of antibody that induces half-maximal inhibition of IL-23 proliferation.\n\n\n \n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-23 response\n\n\n\n\nHuman, Cyno\n\n\n \n \n \nBa/F3 \ntransfectants\n are maintained in RPMI-1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 50 µg/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 ng/mL mouse IL-3. \"Cyno\" refers to cynomolgus monkey IL-23.\n\n\n \n\n\nProliferation Bioassay Medium\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBa/F3 proliferation bioassays were performed in RPMI-1640 medium,10% fetal calf serum, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 50 µg/mL penicillin-streptomycin.\n\n\n \n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays were performed in 96-well flat bottom plates (Falcon 3072 or similar). All preparations of reagents and cell suspensions utilized the appropriate bioassay medium. The assay volume was 150 µL per well. Titrations of an anti-IL-23 antibody were pre-incubated with IL-23 for 30-60 min at room temperature, during which time cells were prepared. Cells were added to plates following the antibody-cytokine pre-incubation. Bioassay plates were incubated in a humidified tissue culture chamber (37C, 5% CO\n2\n) for 40-48 hr. At the end of the culture time, Alamar Blue (Biosource Cat #DAL1100) was added at 16.5 µL/well and allowed to develop for 5-12 hours. Absorbance was then read at 570 nm and 600 nm (VERSAmax Microplate Reader, Molecular Probes), and an OD\n570-600\n was obtained.

Coordinates were determined for a complex of an Fab fragment of the chimeric form of antibody 7G10 and non-linked human IL-23, which comprises p19 and p40 subunits. The sequence of human IL-23p19 is found at SEQ ID NO: 29 and the sequence of the mature form of human IL-12/IL-23 p40 is found at residues 23-328 of GenBank Accession No. P29460. The chimeric form of antibody 7G10 comprises i) a heavy chain comprising the mouse 7G10 V\nH\n domain (SEQ ID NO: 6) fused to a human heavy chain constant region (residues 135 - 464 of SEQ ID NO: 3), and ii) a light chain comprising the mouse 7G10 V\nL\n domain (SEQ ID NO: 18) fused to a human light chain constant region (residues 130 ― 233 of SEQ ID NO: 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-23 amino acid residues within 4.0Å of residues on antibody 7G10 include E82, G86, S87, D88, T91, G92, E93, P94, S95, H106, P133, S134, Q135, P136, W137, R139, L140. Additional residues K83, F90 and L110 were within 5.0Å. An amino acid residue on IL-23p19 is considered to be within a given distance of the antibody (e.g. 4.0Å or 5.0Å) if the coordinates of any atom of the residue are within the given distance of the coordinates of any atom of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of these contacted residues fall into two main clusters along the primary structure of IL-23p19, with the first cluster comprising residues 82-95 (in which 11 of 14 residues are within 5.0Å of the antibody and 9 of 14 are within 4.0Å) and the second cluster comprising residues 133-140 (in which 7 of 8 residues are within 4.0Å of the antibody). These clusters define epitopes comprising stretches of 8 or more contiguous amino acid residues of IL-23p19 in which 50%, 70% and 85% or more of the residues are within 5.0Å of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies binding to either or both of these clusters would be expected to block binding of antibody 7G10. Given the strong sequence homology between all six CDR sequences (see \nFIGS. 1A\n ― 1C and 2A ― 2C), it is likely that the other antibodies comprising the \"(a) light chain subfamily\" (6H12, 33B12, 13F11, 13B5, 13G1, 11C10, 7E2, 30F11, 34E4, 6H4, 33D2) will also bind to substantially the same epitope in IL-23p19 as antibody 7G10.

Description\n\n\n\n\n CD127 Binding Proteins \n\n\nField of the invention \n\n\nThe present invention relates to antigen binding proteins, in particular immunoglobulins, that specifically bind to the a-chain of the human IL-7 receptor (CD127). The invention also concerns methods of treating diseases or disorders with said proteins, \n\n\npharmaceutical compositions comprising said proteins and methods of their manufacture. Other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the description below. \n\n\nBackground of the invention \n\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system. In MS, it is believed that infiltrating inflammatory immune cells are involved in the destruction of oligodendrocytes, which are the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer, known as the myelin sheath. MS results in the thinning or complete loss of myelin. When the myelin is lost, the neurons can no longer effectively conduct their electrical signals leading to numerous neurologic dysfunctions. Individuals with MS produce autoreactive T cells that participate in the formation of inflammatory lesions along the myelin sheath of nerve fibres. The cerebrospinal fluid of patients with active MS contains activated T cells, which infiltrate the brain tissue and cause characteristic inflammatory lesions, destroying the myelin. While the multiple sclerosis symptoms and course of illness can vary from person to person, there are three principle forms of the disease— relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS, and primary progressive MS. \n\n\nIn the early stages of MS, inflammatory attacks occur over short intervals of acutely heightened disease activity. These episodes are followed by periods of recovery and remission. During the remission period, the local swelling in the nervous system lesion resolves, the immune cells become less active or inactive, and the myelin-producing cells remyelinate the axons. Nerve signalling improves, and the disability caused by the inflammation becomes less severe or goes away entirely. This phase of the disease is called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The lesions do not all heal completely, though. Some remain as \"chronic\" lesions, which usually have a demyelinated core region which lacks immune cells. Over time, the cells in the centre of such lesions mostly die, although \n\n\n l \n\n inflammation often continues at their edges. The brain can adapt well to the loss of some neurons, and permanent disability may not occur for many years. However, more than 50% of patients with MS eventually enter a stage of progressive deterioration, called secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In this stage, the disease no longer responds well to disease-modifying drugs, and patients' disabilities steadily worsen. The destruction of neurons from early in the natural course of MS suggests that the progressive disabilities of SPMS might be the result of an accumulated neuronal loss that eventually overwhelms the brain's compensatory abilities. Primary progressive MS is a type of multiple sclerosis where there are no relapses, but over a period of years, there is gradual loss of physical and cognitive functions. \n\n\nThe goal of treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses (and thereby prevent exacerbations) as well as to prevent or postpone the onset of the progressive phase of the disease. To achieve this goal, in the past especially, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs have been used, but they have never found widespread acceptance owing to limited efficacy and considerable toxicity. For example, large randomized controlled trials have been performed successfully with interferon beta-1 a, interferon beta-1 b, and glatiramer acetate. \n\n\nBoth altered autoimmune T cell responses and dysfunction of the regulatory network of the immune system play an important role in human autoimmune pathologies, such as MS and rheumatoid arthritis (Kuchroo et al., (2002) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 20:101 -123; \n\n\nSospedra and Martin (2005) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 23: 683-747; Toh and Miossec (2007) Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 19:284-288). \n\n\nAlthough the aetiology and pathogenesis of MS remain unknown, it is generally considered an autoimmune pathology in which autoreactive T cells of pathogenic potential, such as T\nH\n1 and T\nH\n17 cells, are thought to play an important role. There is evidence that these effector T cells are activated in vivo during the disease process and are attributable to the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. There is also evidence that these T cells mediate destruction of myelin-expressing cells in lesions of EAE and MS during the active phase of the disease. On the other hand, regulatory T cells (T\nreg\n) that normally keep pathogenic T\nH\n1 and T\nH\n17 cells in check are deficient in patients with MS, further tilting the immune system toward an pro-inflammatory state. \n\n Three separate groups recently reported the results of genome wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) scanning in a total of 17,947 donors with or without MS. After scanning 334,923 SNPs, they found a highly significant association (overall P=2.9x10\n\"7\n) of a nonsynonymous coding SNP in the human IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ra) with MS susceptibility. The SNP corresponds to a change from T to C in exon 6 of CD127 (also known as IL-7Ra). This change enhances the chance of exon 6 skipping during RNA splicing, resulting in a soluble form of CD127. Furthermore, expressions of CD127 and IL- 7 RNAs in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) of MS patients are significantly higher relative to CSFs of patients with other neurological disorders. \n\n\nIL-7 and IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) are known to play an important role in T cell and B cell development and homeostasis mainly in a thymic environment. Indeed, thymic stromal cells, fetal thymus, and bone marrow are sites of IL-7 of production. The IL-7 receptor consists of two subunits, CD127 and a common chain (gamma chain or vc) which is shared by receptors of IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. \n\n\nCD127 is also known as IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Ra) and p90 IL-7R. Human CD127 (Swiss Prot accession number P16871 ) has a total of 459 amino acids (20 signal sequence). It comprises a 219 amino acid extra cellular region, a 25 amino acid transmembrane region and a 195 amino acid intracellular region. The numbering of residues within CD127, as used herein (e.g. for the description of antibody epitopes) is based on the full length protein, including signal sequence residues. CD127 may exist in four isoforms, the isoform H20 (Swissprot accession number P16871 -1 ) has the following amino acid sequence (including signal sequence): \n\n\nMTILGTTFGM VFSLLQVVSG ESGYAQNGDL EDAELDDYSF SCYSQLEVNG SQHSLTCAFE\n\n\nDPDVNTTNLE FEICGALVEV KCLNFRKLQE IYFIETKKFL LIGKSNICVK VGEKSLTCKK\n\n\nIDLTTIVKPE APFDLSVIYR EGANDFWTF NTSHLQKKYV KVLMHDVAYR QEKDENKWTH\n\n\nVNLSSTKLTL LQRKLQPAAM YEIKVRSIPD HYFKGFWSEW SPSYYFRTPE INNSSGEMDP\n\n\nILLTISILSF FSVALLVILA CVLWKKRIKP IVWPSLPDHK KTLEHLCKKP RKNLNVSFNP \n\n ESFLDCQIHR VDDIQARDEV EGFLQDTFPQ QLEESEKQRL GGDVQSPNCP SEDVWTPES\n\n\nFGRDSSLTCL AGNVSACDAP ILSSSRSLDC RESGKNGPHV YQDLLLSLGT TNSTLPPPFS\n\n\nLQSGILTLNP VAQGQPILTS LGSNQEEAYV TMSSFYQNQ (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) \n\n\nCD127 is also found in the receptor of thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin (TSLP). The TSLP receptor is a heterodimer of CD127 and cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2). \n\n\nBinding of IL-7 to the IL-7R activates multiple signalling pathways including the activation of JAK kinases 1 and 3 leading to the phosphorylation and activation of Stat5. This pathway is crucial to the survival of thymic developing T cell precursors because Stat5 activation is required in the induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the prevention of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax entry into the mitochondrion. Another IL-7R mediated pathway is the activation of PI3 kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation of the pro- apoptotic protein Bad and its cytoplasm retention. CD127 is expressed in peripheral resting and memory T cells. The mechanism of IL-7 regulation of T cell survival and homeostasis and the source of IL-7 in the periphery are not completely understood. Furthermore, its potential role in the differentiation and function of pathogenic T cells in autoimmune disease is poorly studied and largely unknown. There are few reports suggesting that IL-7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. \n\n\nRecently, Liu and colleagues (Liu et al, (2010) Nature Medicine 16:191 -197) have described the role of IL-7 in T\nH\n17 survival and expansion. Murine anti-CD127 antibodies (including the anti-CD127 antibodies 1A1 1 and 6A3) and their role in the treatment of MS and other autoimmune diseases have been described in PCT application number PCT/US2009/053136. \n\n\nIt is desirable to isolate and develop further monoclonal antibodies that bind to and/or inhibit the biological effect of human CD127. Such antibodies may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of MS and other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and disorders, particularly those in which pathogenic T\nH\n17 cells have been implicated. \n\n Summary of the Invention \n\n\nThe invention provides antigen binding proteins which specifically bind to CD127.

Other diseases which may be treated by the administration of the antigen binding proteins of the invention are described herein. \n\n\nThe invention also provides an antigen binding protein as described herein for use in the treatment of a subject afflicted with an autoimmune or inflammatory disease; a disease in which pathogenic T\nH\n17 cells are implicated; or a disease associated with up-regulated expression of IL17. \n\n The invention provides the use of an antigen binding protein as described herein in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a subject afflicted with an autoimmune or inflammatory disease; a disease in which pathogenic T\nH\n17 cells are implicated; or a disease associated with up-regulated expression of IL17. \n\n\nOther aspects and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description that follows. \n\n\nBrief description of the drawings \n\n\nFigure 1 shows the complement dependent cytotoxicity of the anti-IL7R mAb 1A1 1 H3L4 on HEK293 cells expressing hlL-7R. \n\n\n Figure 2 shows the antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of the humanised anti- IL7R mAb 1 A1 1 H3L4 and the Fc-disabled anti-IL7R mAb (1 A1 1 H3L4Fc) on HEK293 cells expressing hlL-7R, in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. \n\n\nFigures 3A and 3B show the inhibition of IL-7-induced STAT5 phosphorylation by 1A1 1 H3L4 in human PBMC provided by two separate donors. \n\n\n Figures 4A to 4D show the inhibition of IL-7-induced IL-17 production in differentiated human Th17 cells by 1 A1 1 H3L4 (in four different donors). \n\n\n Figures 5A to 5E show that 1 A1 1 H3L4 does not affect TSLP-induction of TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine). \n\n\nDetailed description \n\n\nIL-7/IL-7R signalling is critically required for survival and expansion of committed T\nH\n17 cells in both mouse and human systems, while its role in T\nH\n17 differentiation is not essential compared to that of IL-6 (Liu et al, (2010) Nature Medicine 16:191 -197). \n\n\nSurprisingly, the in vivo effect on the immune system by IL-7R antagonism is highly selective in EAE, an animal model for multiple sclerosis, affecting T\nH\n17 cells and, to a lesser extent, T\nH\n1 cells predominantly of the memory phenotype, and sparing T\nreg\n cells. This selectivity appears to play an important role in rebalancing the ratio of pathogenic T\nH\n17 cells and T\nreg\n cells by IL-7R antagonism in EAE and is attributable to the treatment efficacy. \n\n The role of IL-7/IL-7R signalling in T\nH\n17 cell survival and expansion supports the treatment efficacy of IL-7R antagonism in human autoimmune diseases, such as MS. IL-7 neutralization or IL-7R antagonism is likely to have unique therapeutic advantages. On one hand, the treatment offers the selectivity that distinguishes pathogenic T\nH\n1 and T\nH\n17 cells from T\nreg\n and unrelated immune cells. On the other hand, additional therapeutic advantages of IL-7R antagonism involve its selective effect on survival and expansion of differentiated T\nH\n17 as opposed to T\nH\n17 differentiation. It is conceivable that targeting in vivo maintenance of committed T\nH\n17 versus T\nH\n17 differentiation is more efficacious in a therapeutic context. Inhibition of IL-7 receptor mediated signalling therefore provides a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. \n\n\nThe term IL-7R mediated signalling, as used herein, means the biological effect instigated by the IL-7 receptor complex when bound by its ligand, IL-7. IL-7R mediated signalling therefore includes, but is not necessarily limited to, one or more, or all, of IL-7 induced phosphorylation of STAT-5, IL-7 induced expansion of T\nH\n17 cells and IL-7 induced survival of T\nH\n17 cells. \n\n\nMurine antibodies 1A1 1 and 6A3 are described in patent application number \n\n\nPCT/US2009/053136 (WO2010/017468). These antibodies specifically bind to the alpha chain of the human IL-7 receptor, CD127 (SEQ ID NO:1 ). The variable domains of these antibodies are described in SEQ ID NO:8 and 9 (V\nH\n, VK 1A1 1 , respectively) and SEQ ID NO:45 and 46 (V\nH\n, VK 6A3, respectively). \n\n\nThe present invention provides antigen binding proteins comprising one or more of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of 1 A1 1 or 6A3, and variants thereof. The antigen binding proteins may bind to and neutralise IL-7R signalling. In one embodiment, the invention provides humanised antibodies, comprising the from one to six of the CDRs from murine antibodies 1 A1 1 or 6A3 (the donor antibody) in an a human acceptor antibody. \n\n\nThe term \"antigen binding protein\" as used herein refers to antibodies, antibody fragments and other protein constructs, such as domains, which are capable of binding to CD127. In an embodiment, the antigen binding protein is an antibody. \n\n The term \"antibody\" is used herein in the broadest sense to refer to molecules with an immunoglobulin-like domain and includes monoclonal, recombinant, polyclonal, chimeric, humanised, bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies; a single variable domain, a domain antibody, antigen binding fragments, immunologically effective fragments, single chain Fv, diabodies, Tandabs™, etc (for a summary of alternative \"antibody\" formats see Holliger and Hudson, Nature Biotechnology, 2005, Vol 23, No. 9, 1 126-1 136). \n\n\nThe phrase \"single variable domain\" refers to an antigen binding protein variable domain (for example, V\nH\n, V\nH\nH, V\nl\n) that specifically binds an antigen or epitope independently of a different variable region or domain. \n\n\nA \"domain antibody\" or \"dAb\" may be considered the same as a \"single variable domain\" which is capable of binding to an antigen. A single variable domain may be a human antibody variable domain, but also includes single antibody variable domains from other species such as rodent (for example, as disclosed in WO 00/29004), nurse shark and Camelid V\nH\nH dAbs. Camelid V\nH\nH are immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides that are derived from species including camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco, which produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chains. Such V\nH\nH domains may be humanised according to standard techniques available in the art, and such domains are considered to be \"domain antibodies\". As used herein V\nH\n includes camelid V\nH\nH domains. \n\n\nAs used herein the term \"domain\" refers to a folded protein structure which has tertiary structure independent of the rest of the protein. Generally, domains are responsible for discrete functional properties of proteins, and in many cases may be added, removed or transferred to other proteins without loss of function of the remainder of the protein and/or of the domain. A \"single variable domain\" is a folded polypeptide domain comprising sequences characteristic of antibody variable domains. It therefore includes complete antibody variable domains and modified variable domains, for example, in which one or more loops have been replaced by sequences which are not characteristic of antibody variable domains, or antibody variable domains which have been truncated or comprise N- or C-terminal extensions, as well as folded fragments of variable domains which retain at least the binding activity and specificity of the full-length domain. A domain can bind an antigen or epitope independently of a different variable region or domain. \n\n An antigen binding fragment may be provided by means of arrangement of one or more CDRs on non-antibody protein scaffolds such as a domain. A non-antibody protein scaffold or domain is one that has been subjected to protein engineering in order to obtain binding to a ligand other than its natural ligand, for example a domain which is a derivative of a scaffold selected from: CTLA-4 (Evibody); lipocalin; Protein A derived molecules such as Z-domain of Protein A (Affibody, SpA), A-domain (Avimer/Maxibody); heat shock proteins such as GroEI and GroES; transferrin (trans-body); ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin); peptide aptamer; C-type lectin domain (Tetranectin); human γ-crystallin and human ubiquitin (affilins); PDZ domains; scorpion toxinkunitz type domains of human protease inhibitors; and fibronectin (adnectin); which has been subjected to protein engineering in order to obtain binding to a ligand other than its natural ligand. \n\n\nCTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4) is a CD28-family receptor expressed on mainly CD4+ T-cells. Its extracellular domain has a variable domain-like Ig fold. Loops corresponding to CDRs of antibodies can be substituted with heterologous sequence to confer different binding properties. CTLA-4 molecules engineered to have different binding specificities are also known as Evibodies. For further details see Journal of Immunological Methods 248 (1 -2), 31 -45 (2001 ). \n\n\nLipocalins are a family of extracellular proteins which transport small hydrophobic molecules such as steroids, bilins, retinoids and lipids. They have a rigid β-sheet secondary structure with a number of loops at the open end of the canonical structure which can be engineered to bind to different target antigens. Anticalins are between 160- 180 amino acids in size, and are derived from lipocalins. For further details see Biochim Biophys Acta 1482: 337-350 (2000), US7250297B1 and US20070224633. \n\n\nAn affibody is a scaffold derived from Protein A of Staphylococcus aureus which can be engineered to bind to an antigen. The domain consists of a three-helical bundle of approximately 58 amino acids. Libraries have been generated by randomisation of surface residues. For further details see Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 17, 455-462 (2004) and \n\n\nEP1641818A1. \n\n\nAvimers are multidomain proteins derived from the A-domain scaffold family. The native domains of approximately 35 amino acids adopt a defined disulphide bonded structure. Diversity is generated by shuffling of the natural variation exhibited by the family of A- \n\n domains. For further details see Nature Biotechnology 23(12), 1556 - 1561 (2005) and Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs 16(6), 909-917 (June 2007). \n\n\nA transferrin is a monomeric serum transport glycoprotein. Transferrins can be engineered to bind different target antigens by insertion of peptide sequences, such as one or more CDRs, in a permissive surface loop. Examples of engineered transferrin scaffolds include the Trans-body. For further details see J. Biol. Chem 274, 24066-24073 (1999). \n\n\nDesigned Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are derived from Ankyrin which is a family of proteins that mediate attachment of integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. A single ankyrin repeat is a 33 residue motif consisting of two a-helices and a β-turn. They can be engineered to bind different target antigens by: randomising residues in the first a- helix and a β-turn of each repeat; or insertion of peptide sequences, such as one or more CDRs. Their binding interface can be increased by increasing the number of modules (a method of affinity maturation). For further details see J. Mol. Biol. 332, 489-503 (2003), PNAS 100(4), 1700-1705 (2003) and J. Mol. Biol. 369, 1015-1028 (2007) and \n\n\nUS20040132028A1 . \n\n\nFibronectin is a scaffold which can be engineered to bind to antigen. Adnectins consists of a backbone of the natural amino acid sequence of the 10th domain of the 15 repeating units of human fibronectin type III (FN3). Three loops at one end of the β-sandwich can be engineered to enable an Adnectin to specifically recognize a therapeutic target of interest. For further details see Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 18, 435-444 (2005), US20080139791 , WO2005056764 and US6818418B1. \n\n\nPeptide aptamers are combinatorial recognition molecules that consist of a constant scaffold protein, typically thioredoxin (TrxA) which contains a constrained variable peptide loop inserted at the active site. For further details see Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 5, 783-797 (2005). \n\n\nMicrobodies are derived from naturally occurring microproteins of 25-50 amino acids in length which contain 3-4 cysteine bridges; examples of microproteins include KalataBI and conotoxin and knottins. The microproteins have a loop which can be engineered to include up to 25 amino acids without affecting the overall fold of the microprotein. For further details of engineered knottin domains, see WO2008098796. \n\n Other binding domains include proteins which have been used as a scaffold to engineer different target antigen binding properties include human γ-crystallin and human ubiquitin (affilins), kunitz type domains of human protease inhibitors, PDZ-domains of the Ras- binding protein AF-6, scorpion toxins (charybdotoxin), C-type lectin domain (tetranectins) are reviewed in Chapter 7 - Non-Antibody Scaffolds from Handbook of Therapeutic Antibodies (2007, edited by Stefan Dubel) and Protein Science 15:14-27 (2006). Binding domains of the present invention could be derived from any of these alternative protein domains and any combination of the CDRs of the present invention grafted onto the domain. \n\n\nAn antigen binding fragment or an immunologically effective fragment may comprise partial heavy or light chain variable sequences. Fragments are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids in length. Alternatively the fragments are at least 15, at least 20, at least 50, at least 75, or at least 100 amino acids in length. \n\n\nThe term \"specifically binds\" as used throughout the present specification in relation to antigen binding proteins means that the antigen binding protein binds to CD127 with no or insignificant binding to other (for example, unrelated) proteins - i.e. the antigen binding proteins and antibodies described herein may specifically bind CD127. The term however does not exclude the fact that the antigen binding proteins may also be cross-reactive with CD127 from other species, such as murine CD127, cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) or marmoset CD127. In an embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to both cynomolgus monkey and marmoset CD127. The antigen binding proteins described herein may bind to human CD127 with at least 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 1000 fold greater affinity than they bind to CD127 from other species. \n\n\nThe binding affinity or equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of the antigen binding protein- CD127 interaction may be 100 nM or less, 10 nM or less, 2 nM or less or 1 nM or less. Alternatively the K\nD\n may be between 5 and 10 nM; or between 1 and 2 nM. The K\nD\n may be between 1 pM and 500 pM; or between 500 pM and 1 nM. The binding affinity of the antigen binding protein is determined by the association rate constant (k\na\n) and the dissociation rate constant (k\nd\n) (K\nD\n = k\nd\n/k\na\n). The binding affinity may be measured by BIAcore™, for example by antigen capture with CD127 coupled onto a CM5 chip by primary amine coupling and antibody capture onto this surface. The BIAcore™ method \n\n described in Example 4 may be used to measure binding affinity. Alternatively, the binding affinity can be measured by FORTEbio, for example by antigen capture with CD127 coupled onto a CM5 needle by primary amine coupling and antibody capture onto this surface. \n\n\nThe k\nd\n may be 1x10\n\"3\n s\n\"1\n or less, 1x10\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n or less, or 1 x10\n\"5\n s\n\"1\n or less. The k\nd\n may be between 1x10\n\"5\n s\n\"1\n and 1x10\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n; or between 1x10\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n and 1x10\n\"3\n s\n'\n A slow k\nd\n may result in a slow dissociation of the antigen binding protein-ligand complex and improved neutralisation of the ligand. \n\n\nIt will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the term \"derived\" is intended to define not only the source in the sense of it being the physical origin for the material but also to define material which is structurally identical to the material but which does not originate from the reference source. Thus \"residues found in the donor antibody\" need not necessarily have been purified from the donor antibody. \n\n\nBy isolated it is intended that the molecule, such as an antigen binding protein, is removed from the environment in which it may be found in nature. For example, the molecule may be purified away from substances with which it would normally exist in nature. For example, the antigen binding protein can be purified to at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, or greater with respect to a culture media containing the antigen binding protein. The antigen binding proteins and antibodies of the present invention may be isolated antigen binding proteins and antibodies. \n\n\nA \"chimeric antibody\" refers to a type of engineered antibody which contains a naturally- occurring variable region (light chain and heavy chains) derived from a donor antibody in association with light and heavy chain constant regions derived from an acceptor antibody. \n\n\nA \"humanised antibody\" refers to a type of engineered antibody having one or more of its CDRs derived from a non-human donor immunoglobulin, the remaining immunoglobulin- derived parts of the molecule being derived from one or more human immunoglobulin(s). In addition, framework support residues may be altered to preserve binding affinity (see, e.g., Queen et al. Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA, 86:10029-10032 (1989), Hodgson et al. \n\n\nBio/Technology, 9:421 (1991 )). A suitable human acceptor antibody may be one selected \n\n from a conventional database, e.g., the KABAT® database, Los Alamos database, and Swiss Protein database, by homology to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the donor antibody. A human antibody characterized by a homology to the framework regions of the donor antibody (on an amino acid basis) may be suitable to provide a heavy chain constant region and/or a heavy chain variable framework region for insertion of the donor CDRs. A suitable acceptor antibody capable of donating light chain constant or variable framework regions may be selected in a similar manner. It should be noted that the acceptor antibody heavy and light chains are not required to originate from the same acceptor antibody. The prior art describes several ways of producing such humanised antibodies, see for example EP-A-0239400 and EP-A-054951 . \n\n\nThe term \"donor antibody\" refers to an antibody which contributes the amino acid sequences of its variable regions, one or more CDRs, or other functional fragments or analogs thereof to a first immunoglobulin partner. The donor therefore provides the altered immunoglobulin coding region and resulting expressed altered antibody with the antigenic specificity and neutralising activity characteristic of the donor antibody. \n\n\nThe term \"acceptor antibody\" refers to an antibody which is heterologous to the donor antibody, which contributes all (or any portion) of the amino acid sequences encoding its heavy and/or light chain framework regions and/or its heavy and/or light chain constant regions to the first immunoglobulin partner. A human antibody may be the acceptor antibody. \n\n\nThe terms \"V\nH\n\" and \"V\nL\n\" are used herein to refer to the heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region respectively of an antigen binding protein. VK is also used to refer to the variable light chain domain. \n\n\n\"CDRs\" are defined as the complementarity determining region amino acid sequences of an antigen binding protein. These are the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. There are three heavy chain and three light chain CDRs (or CDR regions) in the variable portion of an immunoglobulin. Thus, \"CDRs\" as used herein refers to all three heavy chain CDRs, all three light chain CDRs, all heavy and light chain CDRs, or at least two CDRs. \n\n Throughout this specification, amino acid residues in variable domain sequences and full length antibody sequences are numbered according to the Kabat numbering convention, unless otherwise specified. Similarly, the terms \"CDR\", \"CDRL1 \", \"CDRL2\", \"CDRL3\", \"CDRH 1 \", \"CDRH2\", \"CDRH3\" used in the Examples follow the Kabat numbering convention. For further information, see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of \n\n\nImmunological Interest, 4th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (1987). \n\n\nIt will be apparent to those skilled in the art that there are alternative numbering conventions for amino acid residues in variable domain sequences and full length antibody sequences. There are also alternative numbering conventions for CDR sequences, for example those set out in Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342: 877-883. The structure and protein folding of the antibody may mean that other residues are considered part of the CDR sequence and would be understood to be so by a skilled person. \n\n\nTherefore, the term \"corresponding CDR\" is used herein to refer to a CDR sequence using any numbering convention, for example those set out in Table 1 . \n\n\nOther numbering conventions for CDR sequences available to a skilled person include \"AbM\" (University of Bath) and \"contact\" (University College London) methods. The minimum overlapping region using at least two of the Kabat, Chothia, AbM and contact methods can be determined to provide the \"minimum binding unit\". The minimum binding unit may be a sub-portion of a CDR. \n\n\nTable 1 below represents one definition using each numbering convention for each CDR or binding unit. The Kabat numbering scheme is used in Table 1 to number the variable domain amino acid sequence. It should be noted that some of the CDR definitions may vary depending on the individual publication used. \n\n\nTABLE 1: \n\n\n Minimu\n\n\nChothia m \n\n\n Kabat CDR AbM CDR Contact CDR \n\n\n CDR binding unit\n\n\nH1 31-35/35A/35B 26-32/33/34 26-35/35A/35B 30-35/35 A/35 B 31 -32 \n\n\n H2 50-65 52-56 50-58 47-58 52-56 \n\n H3 95-102 95-102 95-102 93-101 95-101\n\n\nL1 24-34 24-34 24-34 30-36 30-34 \n\n\n L2 50-56 50-56 50-56 46-55 50-55 \n\n\n L3 89-97 89-97 89-97 89-96 89-96 \n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"antigen binding site\" refers to a site on an antigen binding protein which is capable of specifically binding to an antigen. This may be a single domain (for example, an epitope-binding domain), or single-chain Fv (ScFv) domains or it may be paired V\nH\n/V\nL\n domains as can be found on a standard antibody. \n\n\nThe term \"epitope\" as used herein refers to that portion of the antigen that makes contact with a particular binding domain of the antigen binding protein. An epitope may be linear, comprising an essentially linear amino acid sequence from the antigen. Alternatively, an epitope may be conformational or discontinuous. For example, a conformational epitope comprises amino acid residues which require an element of structural constraint. A discontinuous epitope comprises amino acid residues that are separated by other sequences, i.e. not in a continuous sequence in the antigen's primary sequence. In the context of the antigen's tertiary and quaternary structure, the residues of a discontinuous epitope are near enough to each other to be bound by an antigen binding protein. \n\n\nFor nucleotide and amino acid sequences, the term \"identical\" or \"sequence identity\" indicates the degree of identity between two nucleic acid or two amino acid sequences, and if required when optimally aligned and compared with appropriate insertions or deletions. \n\n\nThe percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity = number of identical positions/total number of positions times 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm, as described below. \n\n\nThe percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The percent \n\n identity between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:1 1 -17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48:444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. \n\n\nIn one method, a polynucleotide sequence may be identical to a reference polynucleotide sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO: 30-39, SEQ ID NO:76-105), that is be 100% identical, or it may include up to a certain integer number of nucleotide alterations as compared to the reference sequence, such as at least 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 99% identical. Such alterations are selected from at least one nucleotide deletion, substitution, including transition and transversion, or insertion, and wherein said alterations may occur at the 5' or 3' terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among the nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The number of nucleotide alterations is determined by multiplying the total number of nucleotides in the reference polynucleotide sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO: 30-39, SEQ ID NO:76-105), by the numerical percent of the respective percent identity (divided by 100) and subtracting that product from said total number of nucleotides in the reference \n\n\npolynucleotide sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO: 30-39, SEQ ID NO:76-105), or: \n\n\nn\nn\n < x\nn\n - (x\nn\n · y), \n\n\nwherein n\nn\n is the number of nucleotide alterations, x\nn\n is the total number of nucleotides in the reference polynucleotide sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO: 30-39, SEQ ID NO:76-105), and y is 0.50 for 50%, 0.60 for 60%, 0.70 for 70%, 0.75 for 75%, 0.80 for 80%, 0.85 for 85%, 0.90 for 90%, 0.95 for 95%, 0.98 for 98%, 0.99 for 99% or 1.00 for 100%, · is the symbol for the multiplication operator, and wherein any non- integer product of x\nn\n and y is rounded down to the nearest integer prior to subtracting it from x\nn\n. \n\n Similarly, a polypeptide sequence may be identical to a polypeptide reference sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO: 1 -29, SEQ ID NO:40-75) that is be 100% identical, or it may include up to a certain integer number of amino acid alterations as compared to the reference sequence such that the % identity is less than 100%, such as at least 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 99% identical. Such alterations are selected from the group consisting of at least one amino acid deletion, substitution, including conservative and non-conservative substitution, or insertion, and wherein said alterations may occur at the amino- or carboxy-terminal positions of the reference polypeptide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among the amino acids in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The number of amino acid alterations for a given % identity is determined by multiplying the total number of amino acids in the polypeptide sequence encoded by the polypeptide reference sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO: 1-29, SEQ ID NO:40-75) by the numerical percent of the respective percent identity (divided by 100) and then subtracting that product from said total number of amino acids in the polypeptide reference sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO:1 -29, SEQ ID NO:40-75), or: \n\n\nn\na\n < x\na\n - (x\na\n · y), \n\n\nwherein n\na\n is the number of amino acid alterations, x\na\n is the total number of amino acids in the reference polypeptide sequence as described herein (see for example SEQ ID NO:1- 29, SEQ ID NO:40-75), and y is, 0.50 for 50%, 0.60 for 60%, 0.70 for 70%, 0.75 for 75%, 0.80 for 80%, 0.85 for 85%, 0.90 for 90%, 0.95 for 95%, 0.98 for 98%, 0.99 for 99%, or 1.00 for 100%, · is the symbol for the multiplication operator, and wherein any non-integer product of x\na\n and y is rounded down to the nearest integer prior to subtracting it from x\na\n. \n\n\nThe % identity may be determined across the full length of the sequence, or any fragments thereof; and with or without any insertions or deletions. \n\n\nThe terms \"peptide\", \"polypeptide\" and \"protein\" each refers to a molecule comprising two or more amino acid residues. A peptide may be monomeric or polymeric. \n\n\nIt is well recognised in the art that certain amino acid substitutions are regarded as being \"conservative\". Amino acids are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties and substitutions within groups that maintain all or substantially all of the \n\n binding affinity of the antigen binding protein are regarded as conservative substitutions, see Table 2 below: \n\n\nTABLE 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention provides an antigen binding protein which binds to CD 127 and comprises CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO:4; a variant CDRH3 thereof, or a CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO:132 to SEQ ID NO:137.

One definition of each of the methods can be found at Table 1 and can be applied to the reference heavy chain variable domain (SEQ ID NO:8 or SEQ ID NO:45) and the reference light chain variable domain (SEQ ID NO:9 and SEQ ID NO:46) to determine the corresponding CDR. \n\n\nThe present invention also provides an antigen binding protein which binds to CD127, and comprises a binding unit H3 comprising Kabat residues 95-101 of SEQ ID NO:8, or a variant H3.

For example, the variant is a functional variant which binds to CD127. A partial alteration of the CDR amino acid sequence may be by deletion or substitution of one to several amino acids, or by addition or insertion of one to several amino acids, or by a combination thereof (for example by no more than 10 amino acids). The CDR variant or binding unit variant may contain 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions, in any combination, in the amino acid sequence. The CDR variant or binding unit variant may contain 1 , 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions, insertions or deletions, in any combination, in the amino acid sequence. The substitutions in amino acid residues may be conservative substitutions, for example, substituting one hydrophobic amino acid for an alternative hydrophobic amino acid. For example leucine may be substituted with valine, or isoleucine. \n\n\nThe CDRs L1 , L2, L3, H1 , H2 and H3 tend to structurally exhibit one of a finite number of main chain conformations (canonicals). The particular canonical structure class of a CDR is defined by both the length of the CDR and by the loop packing, determined by residues located at key positions in both the CDRs and the framework regions (structurally determining residues or SDRs). Martin and Thornton (1996; J Mol Biol 263:800-815) have generated an automatic method to define the \"key residue\" canonical templates. Cluster analysis is used to define the canonical classes for sets of CDRs, and canonical templates are then identified by analysing buried hydrophobics, hydrogen-bonding residues, and conserved glycines and prolines. The CDRs of antibody sequences can be assigned to canonical classes by comparing the sequences to the key residue templates and scoring each template using identity or similarity matrices. \n\n\nBased on the canonical class of the 1A1 1 H3L4 antibody (SEQ ID NO: 13 (1A1 1 .H3 V\nH\n) or SEQ ID NO:22 (1A1 1 .L4 V\nK\n)), functional antibody binding could be predicted to be maintained in the presence of the following CDR substitutions, where the amino acid before the Kabat number is the original amino acid sequence of and the amino acid sequence at the end of the Kabat number is the substituted amino acid: \n\n CDRH1 canonicals: \n\n\n Y32I, Y32H, Y32F, Y32T, Y32N, Y32C, Y32E, Y32D \n\n\n T33Y, T33A, T33W, T33G, T33L, T33V \n\n\n M34I, M34V, M34W \n\n\n N35E, N35H, N35Q, N35S, N35Y, N35T \n\n\nCDRH2 canonicals: \n\n\n L50R, L50E, L50W, L50Y, L50G, L50Q, L50V, L50N, L50K, N50A \n\n\n 151 L, 151V, I51T, I51 S, 151 N \n\n\n N52D, N52L, N52S, N52Y \n\n\n Y53A, Y53G, Y53S, Y53K, Y53T, Y53N \n\n\n N54S, N54T, N54K, N54D, N54G \n\n\n V56Y, V56R, V56E, V56D, V56G, V56S, V56A \n\n\n S58K, S58N, S58T, S58D, S58R, S58G, S58F, S58Y \n\n\nCDRH3 canonicals: \n\n\n V102Y, V102H, V102I, V102S, V102D, V102G \n\n\nCDRL1 canonicals: \n\n\n S29V \n\n\n M33L \n\n\nCDRL3 canonicals: \n\n\n Q89L \n\n\n E90Q \n\n\n W91Y \n\n\n Y93S, Y93R \n\n\nThus, the antigen binding protein may or may not have any of the above substitutions within the CDR positions. There may be multiple substitutions per variant CDR, per corresponding CDR, per binding unit, per heavy or light chain variable region, per heavy or light chain, and per antigen binding protein, and therefore any combination of substitution may be present in the antigen binding protein of the invention, provided that the canonical structure of the CDR is maintained. \n\n For the avoidance of doubt, the above-described substitutions should not be construed as limiting the possible CDR substitutions which may be performed whilst still retaining a functional anti-CD127 antibody. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein comprising the CDRs, corresponding CDRs, variant CDRs, binding units or variant binding units described, may display a potency for binding to CD127, as demonstrated by EC50, of within 10 fold, or within 5 fold of the potency demonstrated by 1A1 1 c (chimera, V\nH\n - SEQ ID NO:28, V\nK\n - SEQ ID NO:29) or 6A3c (chimera, V\nH\n - SEQ ID NO:74, V\nK\n - SEQ ID NO:75). Potency for binding to CD127, may be demonstrated by various methods, such as binding affinity (e.g. by BIAcore), or EC50 (e.g. by an ELISA assay). \n\n\nAs discussed above, the particular canonical structure class of a CDR is defined by both the length of the CDR and by the loop packing, determined by residues located at key positions in both the CDRs and the framework regions. Thus in addition to the CDRs listed in SEQ ID NO:2-6, variant CDRs, corresponding CDRs, binding units, or variants thereof, substitutions may be made in the framework residues of an antigen binding protein of the invention, based on the canonical class, while retaining a functional antibody. Such may include (using Kabat numbering): \n\n\nHeavy chain: V, I or G at position 2; L or V at position 4; L, I, M or V at position 20; C at position 22; T, A, V, G or S at position 24; G at position 26; I, F, L or S at position 29; W at position 36; W or Y at position 47; I, M, V or L at position 48; I, L, F, M or V at position 69; V, A, R or L at position 71 ; A, L, V, Y or F at position 78; L or M at position 80; Y or F at position 90; C at position 92; and/or R, K, G, S, H or N at position 94; and/or \n\n\nLight chain: I, L or V at position 2; V, Q, L or E at position 3; M or L at position 4; C at position 23; W at position 35; Y, L or F at position 36; S, L, R or V at position 46; Y, H, F or K at position 49; Y or F at position 71 ; C at position 88; and/or F at position 98. \n\n\nAny one, any combination, or all of the framework positions described above may be present in the antigen binding protein of the invention. There may be multiple variant framework canonical positions per heavy or light chain variable region, per heavy or light chain, and per antigen binding protein, and therefore any combination may be present in \n\n the antigen binding protein of the invention, provided that the canonical structure of the framework is maintained. \n\n\nFor example, the heavy chain variable framework may comprise V at position 2, L at position 4, V at position 20, C at position 22, A at position 24, G at position 26, F at position 29, W at position 36, W at position 47, M at position 48, L at position 69, R at position 71 , A at position 78, M at position 80, Y at position 90, C at position 92, and R at position 94, and, for example, the light chain variable framework may comprise I at position 2, L at position 4, C at position 23, W at position 35, Y at position 36, F at position 71 , C at position 88, E at position 90, and Y at position 93. \n\n\nOne or more of the CDRs, corresponding CDRs, variant CDRs or binding units described herein may be present in the context of a human framework, for example as a humanised or chimeric variable domain. \n\n\nThe humanised heavy chain variable domain may comprise the CDRs listed in SEQ ID NO:2-4, or SEQ ID NO:39-41 ; variant CDRs thereof; corresponding CDRs; binding units; or variants thereof, within an acceptor antibody framework having 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, 98% or greater, 99% or greater or 100% identity in the framework regions to the human acceptor variable domain sequence in SEQ ID NO: 1 16. \n\n\nThe humanised light chain variable domain may comprise the CDRs listed in SEQ ID NO: 5-7 or SEQ ID NO:42-44; variant CDRs thereof; corresponding CDRs; binding units; or variants thereof, within an acceptor antibody framework having 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, 98% or greater, 99% or greater or 100% identity in the framework regions to the human acceptor variable domain sequence in SEQ ID NO: 1 17. \n\n\nThe invention also provides an antigen binding protein which binds to CD127 and comprises a heavy chain variable region selected from any one of SEQ ID NO: 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 121 , 123, 125, 127, 129 or 131.

Any of the light chain variable regions of the invention may be combined with a suitable constant region. \n\n\nThe invention also provides an antigen binding protein which specifically binds to CD127 and comprises any the following heavy chain and light chain variable domain combination: 1A1 1.H3.L4 (SEQ ID NO:13 and SEQ ID NO:22), or an antigen binding protein which has a heavy chain variable domain having at least 75% identity to SEQ ID NO:13 and a light chain variable domain having at least 75% identity to SEQ ID NO:22. The antigen binding protein may also neutralise CD127. \n\n\nAntigen binding proteins as described above, for example variants with a partial alteration of the sequence by chemical modification and/or insertion, deletion or substitution of one or more amino acid residues, or those with 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, 98% or greater, or 99% or greater identity to any of the sequences described above, may display a potency for binding to CD127, as demonstrated by EC50 or BIAcore, of within 10 fold, or within 5 fold of the potency \n\n demonstrated by 1A1 1 or 6A3. Potency for binding to CD 127, may be demonstrated by EC50, carried out by an ELISA assay, or by binding affinity, carried out by BIAcore. \n\n\nThe present inventors have also determined experimentally that certain positions within CDRH3 may be substituted resulting in an reduced binding affinity (i.e. stronger binding). Such CDRH3 analogues are set out in Table 4. Substitutions at positions N98 and F100b (Kabat numbering) were seen to be particularly effective in increasing affinity. Particular substitutions include N98D, N98E, F100bE, F100bl and F100bV. CDRH3 sequences representing these substitutions are SEQ ID NO:132, 133, 134, 135, 136 and 137, respectively. \n\n\nThe present invention contemplates the incorporation of such substitutions into any of the antibodies described herein. \n\n\nIn an embodiment, the antibody of the invention has a W (Trp) residue at position 100. \n\n\nIt may be desirable to modify the effector function so of the antigen binding fragment - for instance, to enhance ADCC or CDC, half life, etc. \n\n\nIn an embodiment, the antigen binding proteins of the invention may be Fc disabled. One way to achieve Fc disablement comprises the substitutions of alanine residues at positions 235 and 237 (EU index numbering) of the heavy chain constant region. \n\n\nAlternatively, the antigen binding protein may be Fc enabled and not comprise the alanine substitutions at positions 235 and 237. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein may have a half life of at least 6 hours, at least 1 day, at least 2 days, at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 7 days, or at least 9 days in vivo in humans, or in a murine animal model. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein may be derived from rat, mouse, primate (e.g. cynomolgus, Old World monkey or Great Ape) or human. The antigen binding protein may be a human, humanised or chimeric antibody. The antigen binding protein may comprise a constant region, which may be of any isotype or subclass. The constant region may be of the IgG isotype, for example lgG1 , lgG2, lgG3, lgG4 or variants thereof. The antigen binding protein constant region may be lgG1. \n\n Mutational changes to the Fc effector portion of the antibody can be used to change the affinity of the interaction between the FcRn and antibody to modulate antibody turnover. The half life of the antibody can be extended in vivo. This could be beneficial to patient populations as maximal dose amounts and maximal dosing frequencies could be achieved as a result of maintaining in vivo IC50 for longer periods of time. The Fc effector function of the antibody may be removed, in its entirety or in part, since it may not be desirable to kill those cells expressing CD 127. This removal may result in an increased safety profile. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein comprising a constant region may have reduced ADCC and/or complement activation or effector functionality. The constant domain may comprise a naturally disabled constant region of lgG2 or lgG4 isotype or a mutated lgG1 constant domain. Examples of suitable modifications are described in EP0307434. One way to achieve Fc disablement comprises the substitutions of alanine residues at positions 235 and 237 (EU index numbering) of the heavy chain constant region. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein may comprise one or more modifications selected from a mutated constant domain such that the antibody has enhanced effector functions/ ADCC and/or complement activation. Examples of suitable modifications are described in Shields et al. J. Biol. Chem (2001 ) 276:6591 -6604, Lazar et al. PNAS (2006) 103:4005-4010 and US6737056, WO2004063351 and WO2004029207. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein may comprise a constant domain with an altered glycosylation profile such that the antigen binding protein has enhanced effector functions/ ADCC and/or complement activation. Examples of suitable methodologies to produce an antigen binding protein with an altered glycosylation profile are described in WO2003/01 1878, WO2006/014679 and EP1229125. \n\n\nThe CD127 polypeptide to which the antigen binding protein binds may be a recombinant polypeptide, and may comprise the extracellular domain (ECD), optionally fused to another protein, such as an Fc domain, or may comprise the full length CD127 protein. CD127 may be in solution or may be attached to a solid surface. For example, CD127 may be attached to beads such as magnetic beads. CD127 may be biotinylated. The biotin molecule conjugated to CD127 may be used to immobilize CD127 on a solid surface by coupling biotinstreptavidin on the solid surface. \n\n The present invention also provides a nucleic acid molecule which encodes an antigen binding protein as described herein. The nucleic acid molecule may comprise a sequence encoding (i) one or more CDRHs, the heavy chain variable sequence, or the full length heavy chain sequence; and (ii) one or more CDRLs, the light chain variable sequence, or the full length light chain sequence, with (i) and (ii) on the same nucleic acid molecule. Alternatively, the nucleic acid molecule which encodes an antigen binding protein described herein may comprise sequences encoding (a) one or more CDRHs, the heavy chain variable sequence, or the full length heavy chain sequence; or (b) one or more CDRLs, the light chain variable sequence, or the full length light chain sequence, with (a) and (b) on separate nucleic acid molecules. \n\n\nThe nucleic acid molecule which encodes the heavy chain variable domain may comprise SEQ ID NO:30-36. The nucleic acid molecule which encodes the light chain variable domain may comprise SEQ ID NO:10-1 13. \n\n\nThe nucleic acid molecule which encodes the heavy chain variable domain may comprise SEQ ID NO:75-96. The nucleic acid molecule which encodes the light chain variable domain may comprise SEQ ID NO:97-100. \n\n\nThe present invention also provides an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule as described herein. Also provided is a recombinant host cell comprising an expression vector as described herein. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein described herein may be produced in a suitable host cell. A method for the production of the antigen binding protein as described herein may comprise the step of culturing a host cell as described herein and recovering the antigen binding protein. A recombinant transformed, transfected, or transduced host cell may comprise at least one expression cassette, whereby said expression cassette comprises a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain of the antigen binding protein described herein and further comprises a polynucleotide encoding a light chain of the antigen binding protein described herein. Alternatively, a recombinant transformed, transfected or transduced host cell may comprise at least one expression cassette, whereby a first expression cassette comprises a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain of the antigen binding protein described herein and further comprise a second cassette comprising a polynucleotide \n\n encoding a light chain of the antigen binding protein described herein. A stably transformed host cell may comprise a vector comprising one or more expression cassettes encoding a heavy chain and/or a light chain of the antigen binding protein described herein. For example such host cells may comprise a first vector encoding the light chain and a second vector encoding the heavy chain. \n\n\nThe host cell may be eukaryotic, for example mammalian. Examples of such cell lines include CHO or NSO. The host cell may be a non-human host cell. The host cell may be a non-embryonic host cell. The host cell may be cultured in a culture media, for example serum- free culture media. The antigen binding protein may be secreted by the host cell into the culture media. The antigen binding protein can be purified to at least 95% or greater (e.g. 98% or greater) with respect to said culture media containing the antigen binding protein. \n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising the antigen binding protein and a \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carrier is also provided by the present invention. A kit-of- parts comprising the pharmaceutical composition together with instructions for use is further provided. For convenience, the kit-of-parts may comprise the reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for use. \n\n\nAntibody Structures \n\n\nIntact Antibodies \n\n\nThe light chains of antibodies from most vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two types called Kappa and Lambda based on the amino acid sequence of the constant region. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, human antibodies can be assigned to five different classes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. IgG and IgA can be further subdivided into subclasses, lgG1 , lgG2, lgG3 and lgG4; and lgA1 and lgA2. Species variants exist with mouse and rat having at least lgG2a, lgG2b. \n\n\nThe more conserved portions of the variable region are called Framework regions (FR). The variable domains of intact heavy and light chains each comprise four FR connected by three CDRs. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR \n\n regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies. \n\n\nThe constant regions are not directly involved in the binding of the antibody to the antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation in antibody dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis via binding to Fey receptor, half-life/clearance rate via neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and complement dependent cytotoxicity via the C1 q component of the complement cascade. \n\n\nThe human lgG2 constant region has been reported to essentially lack the ability to activate complement by the classical pathway or to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The lgG4 constant region has been reported to lack the ability to activate complement by the classical pathway and mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity only weakly. Antibodies essentially lacking these effector functions may be termed 'non-lytic' antibodies. It may be desirable to reduce the effector functon of the antibody according to the invention, optionally to the extent that the antibody has essentially no effector function. In an embodiment, the antibody according to the invention is non-lytic. In an embodiment, the antibody according to the invention has essentially no effector function. The antibody may, or may not, be conjugated to another molecule, for instance a molecule intended to modify the effector function such as a cytotoxic moiety or a radioactive moiety. In an embodiment, the antibody is not conjugated to another molecule such as a radiolabel or cytotoxic molecule. In this embodiment, the antibody achieves its functional effect by blocking a natural biological interaction, rather than by a direct cell-killing effect. \n\n\nHuman antibodies \n\n\nHuman antibodies may be produced by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art. Human antibodies can be made by the hybridoma method using human myeloma or mouse-human heteromyeloma cells lines see Kozbor (1984) J. Immunol 133, 3001 , and Brodeur\nA\n Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, 51-63 (Marcel Dekker Inc, 1987). Alternative methods include the use of phage libraries or transgenic mice both of which utilize human variable region repertories (see Winter (1994) Annu. Rev. Immunol 12: 433-455; Green (1999) J. Immunol. Methods 231 : 1 1 -23). \n\n Several strains of transgenic mice are now available wherein their mouse immunoglobulin loci has been replaced with human immunoglobulin gene segments (see Tomizuka (2000) PNAS 97: 722-727; Fishwild (1996) Nature Biotechnol. 14: 845-851 ; Mendez (1997) Nature Genetics, 15: 146-156). Upon antigen challenge such mice are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies from which antibodies of interest can be selected. \n\n\nPhage display technology can be used to produce human antigen binding proteins (and fragments thereof), see McCafferty (1990) Nature 348: 552-553 and Griffiths et al. (1994) EMBO 13: 3245-3260. \n\n\nThe technique of affinity maturation (Marks Bio/technol (1992) 10: 779-783) may be used to improve binding affinity wherein the affinity of the primary human antibody is improved by sequentially replacing the H and L chain variable regions with naturally occurring variants and selecting on the basis of improved binding affinities. Variants of this technique such as \"epitope imprinting\" are now also available, see for example WO 93/06213; Waterhouse (1993) Nucl. Acids Res. 21 : 2265-2266. \n\n\nChimeric and Humanised Antibodies \n\n\nChimeric antibodies are typically produced using recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the antibodies (e.g. cDNA) is isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the H and L chains of the antibody. Hybridoma cells serve as a typical source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA is placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli, COS cells, CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain synthesis of the antibody. The DNA may be modified by substituting the coding sequence for human L and H chains for the corresponding non-human (e.g. murine) H and L constant regions, see for example Morrison (1984) PNAS 81 : 6851. \n\n\nA large decrease in immunogenicity can be achieved by grafting only the CDRs of a non- human (e.g. murine) antibodies (\"donor\" antibodies) onto human framework (\"acceptor framework\") and constant regions to generate humanised antibodies (see Jones et al. (1986) Nature 321 : 522-525; and Verhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239: 1534-1536). \n\n However, CDR grafting per se may not result in the complete retention of antigen-binding properties and it is frequently found that some framework residues (sometimes referred to as \"back mutations\") of the donor antibody need to be preserved in the humanised molecule if significant antigen-binding affinity is to be recovered (see Queen et al. (1989) PNAS 86: 10,029-10,033: Co et al. (1991 ) Nature 351 : 501-502). In this case, human variable regions showing the greatest sequence homology to the non-human donor antibody are chosen from a database in order to provide the human framework (FR). The selection of human FRs can be made either from human consensus or individual human antibodies. Where necessary, key residues from the donor antibody can be substituted into the human acceptor framework to preserve CDR conformations. Computer modelling of the antibody maybe used to help identify such structurally important residues, see WO 99/48523. \n\n\nAlternatively, humanisation maybe achieved by a process of \"veneering\". A statistical analysis of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions revealed that the precise patterns of exposed residues are different in human and murine antibodies, and most individual surface positions have a strong preference for a small number of different residues (see Padlan et al. (1991 ) Mol. Immunol. 28: 489-498; and Pedersen et al. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235: 959-973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by replacing exposed residues in its framework regions that differ from those usually found in human antibodies. Because protein antigenicity may be correlated with surface accessibility, replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render the mouse variable region \"invisible\" to the human immune system (see also Mark et al. (1994) in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology Vol. 1 13: The pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, 105-134). This procedure of humanisation is referred to as \"veneering\" because only the surface of the antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed. Further alternative approaches include that set out in WO04/006955 and the procedure of Humaneering™ (Kalobios) which makes use of bacterial expression systems and produces antibodies that are close to human germline in sequence (Alfenito-M Advancing Protein Therapeutics January 2007, San Diego, California). \n\n\nBispecific antigen binding proteins \n\n A bispecific antigen binding protein is an antigen binding protein having binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Methods of making such antigen binding proteins are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antigen binding proteins is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin H chain-L chain pairs, where the two H chains have different binding specificities, see Millstein et al. (1983) Nature 305: 537-539; WO 93/08829; and Traunecker et al. (1991 ) EMBO 10: 3655- 3659. Because of the random assortment of H and L chains, a potential mixture of ten different antibody structures are produced of which only one has the desired binding specificity. An alternative approach involves fusing the variable domains with the desired binding specificities to heavy chain constant region comprising at least part of the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions. The CH1 region containing the site necessary for light chain binding may be present in at least one of the fusions. DNA encoding these fusions, and if desired the L chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are then co- transfected into a suitable host organism. It is possible though to insert the coding sequences for two or three chains into one expression vector. In one approach, the bispecific antibody is composed of a H chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a H-L chain pair, providing a second binding specificity in the other arm, see WO \n\n\n94/04690. Also see Suresh et al. (1986) Methods in Enzymology 121 : 210. \n\n\nAntigen Binding Fragments \n\n\nFragments lacking the constant region lack the ability to activate complement by the classical pathway or to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Traditionally such fragments are produced by the proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies by e.g. papain digestion (see for example, WO 94/29348) but may be produced directly from \n\n\nrecombinantly transformed host cells. For the production of ScFv, see Bird et al. (1988) Science 242: 423-426. In addition, antigen binding fragments may be produced using a variety of engineering techniques as described below. \n\n\nFv fragments appear to have lower interaction energy of their two chains than Fab fragments. To stabilise the association of the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains, they have been linked with peptides (Bird et al. (1988) Science 242: 423-426; Huston et al. (1988) PNAS 85(16): 5879-5883), disulphide bridges (Glockshuber et al. (1990) Biochemistry 29: 1362-1367) and \"knob in hole\" mutations (Zhu et al. (1997) Protein Sci., 6: 781-788). ScFv fragments can be produced by methods well known to those skilled in the art, see Whitlow et al. \n\n (1991 ) Methods Companion Methods Enzymol, 2: 97-105 and Huston et al. (1993) Int. Rev. Immunol 10: 195-217. ScFv may be produced in bacterial cells such as E. coli or in eukaryotic cells. One disadvantage of ScFv is the monovalency of the product, which precludes an increased avidity due to polyvalent binding, and their short half-life. Attempts to overcome these problems include bivalent (ScFv')\n2\n produced from ScFv containing an additional C-terminal cysteine by chemical coupling (Adams et al. (1993) Can. Res 53: 4026-4034; and McCartney et al. (1995) Protein Eng. 8: 301-314) or by spontaneous site- specific dimerisation of ScFv containing an unpaired C-terminal cysteine residue (see Kipriyanov et al. (1995) Cell. Biophys 26: 187-204). Alternatively, ScFv can be forced to form multimers by shortening the peptide linker to 3 to 12 residues to form \"diabodies\", see Holliger et al. (1993) PNAS 90: 6444-6448. Reducing the linker still further can result in ScFv trimers (\"triabodies\", see Kortt et al. (1997) Protein Eng 10: 423-433) and tetramers (\"tetrabodies\", see Le Gall et al. (1999) FEBS Lett, 453: 164-168). Construction of bivalent ScFv molecules can also be achieved by genetic fusion with protein dimerising motifs to form \"miniantibodies\" (see Pack et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31 : 1579-1584) and \"minibodies\" (see Hu et al. (1996) Cancer Res. 56: 3055-3061 ). ScFv-Sc-Fv tandems ((ScFv)\n2\n) may also be produced by linking two ScFv units by a third peptide linker, see Kurucz et al. (1995) J. Immol. 154: 4576-4582. Bispecific diabodies can be produced through the noncovalent association of two single chain fusion products consisting of V\nH\n domain from one antibody connected by a short linker to the V\nL\n domain of another antibody, see Kipriyanov et al. (1998) Int. J. Can 77: 763-772. The stability of such bispecific diabodies can be enhanced by the introduction of disulphide bridges or \"knob in hole\" mutations as described supra or by the formation of single chain diabodies (ScDb) wherein two hybrid ScFv fragments are connected through a peptide linker see \n\n\nKontermann et al. (1999) J. Immunol. Methods 226:179-188. Tetravalent bispecific molecules are available by e.g. fusing a ScFv fragment to the CH3 domain of an IgG molecule or to a Fab fragment through the hinge region, see Coloma et al. (1997) Nature Biotechnol. 15: 159-163. Alternatively, tetravalent bispecific molecules have been created by the fusion of bispecific single chain diabodies (see Alt et al. (1999) FEBS Lett 454: 90- 94. Smaller tetravalent bispecific molecules can also be formed by the dimerization of either ScFv-ScFv tandems with a linker containing a helix-loop-helix motif (DiBi miniantibodies, see Muller et al. (1998) FEBS Lett 432: 45-49) or a single chain molecule comprising four antibody variable domains (V\nH\n and V\nL\n) in an orientation preventing intramolecular pairing (tandem diabody, see Kipriyanov et al. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293: 41 - 56). Bispecific F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be created by chemical coupling of Fab' fragments \n\n or by heterodimerization through leucine zippers (see Shalaby et al. (1992) J. Exp. Med. 175: 217-225; and Kostelny et al. (1992), J. Immunol. 148: 1547-1553). Also available are isolated V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains (Domantis pic), see US 6,248,516; US 6,291 ,158; and US 6, 172,197. \n\n\nHeteroconiuaate antibodies \n\n\nHeteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies formed using any convenient cross-linking methods. See, for example, US 4,676,980. \n\n\nOther Modifications \n\n\nThe antigen binding proteins of the present invention may comprise other modifications to enhance or change their effector functions. The term \"Effector Function\" as used herein is meant to refer to one or more of Antibody dependant cell mediated cytotoxic activity (ADCC), Complement-dependant cytotoxic activity (CDC) mediated responses, Fc- mediated phagocytosis and antibody recycling via the FcRn receptor. For IgG antibodies, effector functionalities including ADCC and ADCP are mediated by the interaction of the heavy chain constant region with a family of Fey receptors present on the surface of immune cells. In humans these include FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIII (CD16). Interaction between the antigen binding protein bound to antigen and the formation of the Fc/ Fey complex induces a range of effects including cytotoxicity, immune cell activation, phagocytosis and release of inflammatory cytokines. \n\n\nThe interaction between the constant region of an antigen binding protein and various Fc receptors (FcR) is believed to mediate the effector functions of the antigen binding protein. Significant biological effects can be a consequence of effector functionality, in particular, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), fixation of complement (complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC), and half-life/clearance of the antigen binding protein. Usually, the ability to mediate effector function requires binding of the antigen binding protein to an antigen and not all antigen binding proteins will mediate every effector function. \n\n\nEffector function can be measured in a number of ways including for example via binding of the FcyRIII to Natural Killer cells or via FcyRI to monocytes/macrophages to measure \n\n for ADCC effector function. For example an antigen binding protein of the present invention can be assessed for ADCC effector function in a Natural Killer cell assay. \n\n\nExamples of such assays can be found in Shields et al, 2001 The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, p6591 -6604; Chappel et al, 1993 The Journal of Biological \n\n\nChemistry, Vol 268, p25124-25131 ; Lazar et al, 2006 PNAS, 103; 4005-4010. \n\n\nExamples of assays to determine CDC function include that described in 1995 J Imm Meth 184:29-38. \n\n\nSome isotypes of human constant regions, in particular lgG4 and lgG2 isotypes, essentially lack the functions of a) activation of complement by the classical pathway; and b) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Various modifications to the heavy chain constant region of antigen binding proteins may be carried out depending on the desired effector property. lgG1 constant regions containing specific mutations have separately been described to reduce binding to Fc receptors and therefore reduce ADCC and CDC (Duncan et al. Nature 1988, 332; 563-564; Lund et al. J. Immunol. 1991 , 147; 2657-2662; Chappel et al. PNAS 1991 , 88; 9036-9040; Burton and Woof, Adv. Immunol. 1992, 51 ;1 - 84; Morgan et al., Immunology 1995, 86; 319-324; Hezareh et al., J. Virol. 2001 , 75 (24); 12161-12168). \n\n\nVarious modifications to the Fc region of antibodies may be carried out depending on the desired property. For example, specific mutations in the Fc region to render an otherwise lytic antibody, non-lytic are detailed in EP 0629 240 and EP 0307 434 or one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody to increase serum half life see US 5,739,277. Human Fey receptors include FcyR (I), FcyRlla, FcyRllb, FcyRllla and neonatal FcRn. Shields et al. (2001 ) J. Biol. Chem 276: 6591-6604 demonstrated that a common set of lgG1 residues is involved in binding all FcyRs, while FcyRII and FcyRIII utilize distinct sites outside of this common set. One group of lgG1 residues reduced binding to all FcyRs when altered to alanine: Pro-238, Asp-265, Asp-270, Asn-297 and Pro-239. All are in the IgG CH2 domain and clustered near the hinge joining CH1 and CH2. While FcyRI utilizes only the common set of lgG1 residues for binding, FcyRII and FcyRIII interact with distinct residues in addition to the common set. Alteration of some residues reduced binding only to FcyRII (e.g. Arg-292) or FcyRIII (e.g. Glu-293). Some variants showed improved binding to FcyRII or FcyRIII but did not affect binding to the \n\n other receptor (e.g. Ser-267Ala improved binding to FcyRII but binding to FcyRIII was unaffected). Other variants exhibited improved binding to FcyRII or FcyRIII with reduction in binding to the other receptor (e.g. Ser-298Ala improved binding to FcyRIII and reduced binding to FcyRII). For FcyRllla, the best binding lgG1 variants had combined alanine substitutions at Ser-298, Glu-333 and Lys-334. The neonatal FcRn receptor is believed to be involved in both antibody clearance and the transcytosis across tissues (see Junghans (1997) Immunol. Res 16: 29-57; and Ghetie et al. (2000) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 18: 739- 766). Human lgG1 residues determined to interact directly with human FcRn includes Ile253, Ser254, Lys288, Thr307, Gln31 1 , Asn434 and His435. Substitutions at any of the positions described in this section may enable increased serum half-life and/or altered effector properties of the antibodies. \n\n\nOther modifications include glycosylation variants of the antibodies. Glycosylation of antibodies at conserved positions in their constant regions is known to have a profound effect on antibody function, particularly effector functioning such as those described above, see for example, Boyd et al. (1996) Mol. Immunol. 32: 131 1-1318. Glycosylation variants of the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof wherein one or more carbohydrate moiety is added, substituted, deleted or modified are contemplated. \n\n\nIntroduction of an asparagine-X-serine or asparagine-X-threonine motif creates a potential site for enzymatic attachment of carbohydrate moieties and may therefore be used to manipulate the glycosylation of an antibody. In Raju et al. (2001 ) Biochemistry 40: 8868- 8876 the terminal sialyation of a TNFR-lgG immunoadhesin was increased through a process of regalactosylation and/or resialylation using beta-1 , 4-galactosyltransferace and/or alpha, 2,3 sialyltransferase. Increasing the terminal sialylation is believed to increase the half-life of the immunoglobulin. Antibodies, in common with most \n\n\nglycoproteins, are typically produced as a mixture of glycoforms. This mixture is particularly apparent when antibodies are produced in eukaryotic, particularly mammalian cells. A variety of methods have been developed to manufacture defined glycoforms, see Zhang et al. (2004) Science 303: 371 : Sears et al. (2001 ) Science 291 : 2344; Wacker et al. (2002) Science 298: 1790; Davis et al. (2002) Chem. Rev. 102: 579; Hang et al. (2001 ) Acc. Chem. Res 34: 727. The antibodies (for example of the IgG isotype, e.g. lgG1 ) as herein described may comprise a defined number (e.g. 7 or less, for example 5 or less, such as two or a single) of glycoform(s). \n\n The antibodies may or may not be coupled to a non-proteinaeous polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylene. Conjugation of proteins to PEG is an established technique for increasing half-life of proteins, as well as reducing antigenicity and immunogenicity of proteins. The use of PEGylation with different molecular weights and styles (linear or branched) has been investigated with intact antibodies as well as Fab' fragments, see Koumenis et al. (2000) Int. J. Pharmaceut. 198: 83-95. \n\n\nProduction Methods \n\n\nAntigen binding proteins may be produced in transgenic organisms such as goats (see Pollock et al. (1999) J. Immunol. Methods 231 : 147-157), chickens (see Morrow (2000) Genet. Eng. News 20: 1 -55, mice (see Pollock et al.) or plants (see Doran (2000) Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 1 1 : 199-204; Ma (1998) Nat. Med. 4: 601-606; Baez et al. (2000) BioPharm 13: 50-54; Stoger et al. (2000) Plant Mol. Biol. 42: 583-590). \n\n\nAntigen binding proteins may also be produced by chemical synthesis. However, antigen binding proteins are typically produced using recombinant cell culturing technology well known to those skilled in the art. A polynucleotide encoding the antigen binding protein is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector such as a plasmid for further cloning \n\n\n(amplification) or expression. One expression system is a glutamate synthetase system (such as sold by Lonza Biologies), particularly where the host cell is CHO or NS0. \n\n\nPolynucleotide encoding the antigen binding protein is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. oligonucleotide probes). Vectors that may be used include plasmid, virus, phage, transposons, minichromosomes of which plasmids are typically used. Generally such vectors further include a signal sequence, origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter and transcription termination sequences operably linked to the antigen binding protein polynucleotide so as to facilitate expression. Polynucleotide encoding the light and heavy chains may be inserted into separate vectors and introduced (for example by transformation, transfection, electroporation or transduction) into the same host cell concurrently or sequentially or, if desired both the heavy chain and light chain can be inserted into the same vector prior to said introduction. \n\n Codon optimisation may be used with the intent that the total level of protein produced by the host cell is greater when transfected with the codon-optimised gene in comparison with the level when transfected with the wild-type sequence. Several methods have been published (Nakamura et al. (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24: 214-215; W098/34640; W097/1 1086). Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, alternative polynucleotides to those disclosed herein (particularly those codon optimised for expression in a given host cell) may also encode the antigen binding proteins described herein. The codon usage of the antigen binding protein of this invention thereof can be modified to accommodate codon bias of the host cell such to augment transcript and/or product yield (eg Hoekema et al Mol Cell Biol 1987 7(8): 2914-24). The choice of codons may be based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression. \n\n\nSipnal sequences \n\n\nAntigen binding proteins may be produced as a fusion protein with a heterologous signal sequence having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein. The signal sequence should be recognised and processed by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells, the signal sequence may be for example an alkaline phosphatase, \n\n\npenicillinase, or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequences may be for example a yeast invertase leader, a factor leader or acid phosphatase leaders see e.g. WO90/13646. In mammalian cell systems, viral secretory leaders such as herpes simplex gD signal and a native immunoglobulin signal sequence may be suitable. Typically the signal sequence is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antigen binding protein. \n\n\nOrigin of replication \n\n\nOrigin of replications are well known in the art with pBR322 suitable for most gram- negative bacteria, 2μ plasmid for most yeast and various viral origins such as SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV for most mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors but the SV40 may be used since it contains the early promoter. \n\n\nSelection marker \n\n Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline or (b) complement auxiotrophic deficiencies or supply nutrients not available in the complex media or (c) combinations of both. The selection scheme may involve arresting growth of the host cell. Cells, which have been successfully transformed with the genes encoding the antigen binding protein, survive due to e.g. drug resistance conferred by the co-delivered selection marker. One example is the DHFR selection marker wherein transformants are cultured in the presence of methotrexate. Cells can be cultured in the presence of increasing amounts of methotrexate to amplify the copy number of the exogenous gene of interest. CHO cells are a particularly useful cell line for the DHFR selection. A further example is the glutamate synthetase expression system (Lonza Biologies). An example of a selection gene for use in yeast is the trpl gene, see Stinchcomb et al. (1979) Nature 282: 38. \n\n\nPromoters \n\n\nSuitable promoters for expressing antigen binding proteins are operably linked to \n\n\nDNA/polynucleotide encoding the antigen binding protein. Promoters for prokaryotic hosts include phoA promoter, beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, tryptophan and hybrid promoters such as Tac. Promoters suitable for expression in yeast cells include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes e.g. enolase, glyceralderhyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose 6 phosphate isomerase, 3- phosphoglycerate mutase and glucokinase. Inducible yeast promoters include alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, metallothionein and enzymes responsible for nitrogen metabolism or maltose/galactose utilization. \n\n\nPromoters for expression in mammalian cell systems include viral promoters such as polyoma, fowlpox and adenoviruses (e.g. adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus (in particular the immediate early gene promoter), retrovirus, hepatitis B virus, actin, rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter and the early or late Simian virus 40. Of course the choice of promoter is based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression. A first plasmid may comprise a RSV and/or SV40 and/or CMV promoter, DNA encoding light chain variable region (V\nL\n), KC region together with neomycin and ampicillin resistance selection markers and a second plasmid \n\n comprising a RSV or SV40 promoter, DNA encoding the heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n), DNA encoding the constant region, DHFR and ampicillin resistance markers. \n\n\nEnhancer element \n\n\nWhere appropriate, e.g. for expression in higher eukaryotes, an enhancer element operably linked to the promoter element in a vector may be used. Mammalian enhancer sequences include enhancer elements from globin, elastase, albumin, fetoprotein and insulin. Alternatively, one may use an enhancer element from a eukaroytic cell virus such as SV40 enhancer (at bp100-270), cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, polyma enhancer, baculoviral enhancer or murine lgG2a locus (see WO04/009823). The enhancer may be located on the vector at a site upstream to the promoter. Alternatively, the enhancer may be located elsewhere, for example within the untranslated region or downstream of the polyadenylation signal. The choice and positioning of enhancer may be based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression. \n\n\nPolyadenylation/termination \n\n\nIn eukaryotic systems, polyadenylation signals are operably linked to DNA polynucleotide encoding the antigen binding protein. Such signals are typically placed 3' of the open reading frame. In mammalian systems, non-limiting examples include signals derived from growth hormones, elongation factor-1 alpha and viral (eg SV40) genes or retroviral long terminal repeats. In yeast systems non-limiting examples of polydenylation/termination signals include those derived from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH) genes. In prokaryotic system polyadenylation signals are typically not required and it is instead usual to employ shorter and more defined terminator sequences. The choice of polyadenylation/ termination sequences may be based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression. \n\n\nOther methods/elements for enhanced yields \n\n\nIn addition to the above, other features that can be employed to enhance yields include chromatin remodelling elements, introns and host-cell specific codon modification. \n\n\nHost cells \n\n Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing vectors encoding antigen binding proteins are prokaroytic, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotic cells include eubacteria e.g. enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia e.g. E. coli (for example ATCC 31 ,446; 31 ,537; 27,325), Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella Proteus, Salmonella e.g. Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia e.g. Serratia marcescans and Shigella as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (see DD 266 710), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa and Streptomyces. Of the yeast host cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces (e.g. ATCC 16,045; 12,424; 24178; 56,500), yarrowia (EP402, 226), Pichia pastoris (EP 183 070, see also Peng et al. (2004) J. Biotechnol. 108: 185- 192), Candida, Trichoderma reesia (EP 244 234), Penicillin, Tolypocladium and \n\n\nAspergillus hosts such as A. nidulans and A. niger are also contemplated. \n\n\nHigher eukaryotic host cells include mammalian cells such as COS-1 (ATCC No.CRL 1650) COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651 ), human embryonic kidney line 293, baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) (ATCC CRL.1632), BHK570 (ATCC NO: CRL 10314), 293 (ATCC NO.CRL 1573), Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO (e.g. CHO-K1 , ATCC NO: CCL 61 , DHFR-CHO cell line such as DG44 (see Urlaub et al. (1986) Somatic Cell Mol. Genet.12: 555-556), particularly those CHO cell lines adapted for suspension culture, mouse Sertoli cells, monkey kidney cells, African green monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1587), HELA cells, canine kidney cells (ATCC CCL 34), human lung cells (ATCC CCL 75), Hep G2 and myeloma or lymphoma cells e.g. NS0 (see US 5,807,715), Sp2/0, Y0. \n\n\nSuch host cells may also be further engineered or adapted to modify quality, function and/or yield of the antigen binding protein. Non-limiting examples include expression of specific modifying (e.g. glycosylation) enzymes and protein folding chaperones. \n\n\nCell Culturinq Methods \n\n\nHost cells transformed with vectors encoding antigen binding proteins may be cultured by any method known to those skilled in the art. Host cells may be cultured in spinner flasks, roller bottles or hollow fibre systems but for large scale production that stirred tank reactors are used particularly for suspension cultures. The stirred tankers may be adapted for aeration using e.g. spargers, baffles or low shear impellers. For bubble columns and airlift reactors direct aeration with air or oxygen bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells \n\n are cultured in a serum free culture media, the media is supplemented with a cell protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to help prevent cell damage as a result of the aeration process. Depending on the host cell characteristics, either microcarriers maybe used as growth substrates for anchorage dependent cell lines or the cells maybe adapted to suspension culture (which is typical). The culturing of host cells, particularly invertebrate host cells may utilise a variety of operational modes such as fed-batch, repeated batch processing (see Drapeau et al. (1994) Cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch process or perfusion culture. Although recombinantly transformed mammalian host cells may be cultured in serum-containing media such as fetal calf serum (FCS), for example such host cells are cultured in synthetic serum -free media such as disclosed in Keen et al. (1995) Cytotechnology 17: 153-163, or commercially available media such as ProCHO- CDM or UltraCHO™ (Cambrex NJ, USA), supplemented where necessary with an energy source such as glucose and synthetic growth factors such as recombinant insulin. The serum-free culturing of host cells may require that those cells are adapted to grow in serum free conditions. One adaptation approach is to culture such host cells in serum containing media and repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for the serum-free media so that the host cells learn to adapt in serum free conditions (see e.g. Scharfenberg et al. (1995) in Animal Cell Technology: Developments towards the 21 st century (Beuvery et al. eds, 619-623, Kluwer Academic publishers). \n\n\nAntigen binding proteins secreted into the media may be recovered and purified using a variety of techniques to provide a degree of purification suitable for the intended use. For example the use of antigen binding proteins for the treatment of human patients typically mandates at least 95% purity, more typically 98% or 99% or greater purity (compared to the crude culture medium). Cell debris from the culture media is typically removed using centrifugation followed by a clarification step of the supernatant using e.g. microfiltration, ultrafiltration and/or depth filtration. A variety of other techniques such as dialysis and gel electrophoresis and chromatographic techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA), affinity chromatography (optionally involving an affinity tagging system such as polyhistidine) and/or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC, see US 5, 429,746) are available. The antibodies, following various clarification steps, can be captured using Protein A or G affinity chromatography. Further chromatography steps can follow such as ion exchange and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size exclusion chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation. Various virus removal steps may also be employed (e.g. nanofiltration using e.g. a DV-20 filter). Following these various steps, a purified (for \n\n example a monoclonal) preparation comprising at least 75mg/ml or greater, or 100mg/ml or greater, of the antigen binding protein is provided. Such preparations are substantially free of aggregated forms of antigen binding proteins. \n\n\nBacterial systems may be used for the expression of antigen binding fragments. Such fragments can be localised intracellularly, within the periplasm or secreted extracellularly. Insoluble proteins can be extracted and refolded to form active proteins according to methods known to those skilled in the art, see Sanchez et al. (1999) J. Biotechnol. 72: 13- 20; and Cupit et al. (1999) Lett Appl Microbiol 29: 273-277. \n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions \n\n\nThe terms diseases, disorders and conditions are used interchangeably. Purified preparations of an antigen binding protein as described herein may be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions for use in the treatment of the human diseases described herein. The pharmaceutical composition can be used in the treatment of diseases where IL-7 contributes to the disease or where inhibition/neutralisation of IL-7R-mediated signalling will be beneficial. The pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of the antigen binding protein described herein. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutical preparation may comprise an antigen binding protein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The antigen binding protein may be administered alone, or as part of a pharmaceutical composition. \n\n\nTypically such compositions comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as known and called for by acceptable pharmaceutical practice, see e.g. Remingtons \n\n\nPharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition (1980) Mack Publishing Co. Examples of such carriers include sterilised carriers such as saline, Ringers solution or dextrose solution, optionally buffered with suitable buffers to a pH within a range of 5 to 8. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions may be administered by injection or continuous infusion (e.g. intravenous, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraportal). Such compositions are suitably free of visible particulate matter. Pharmaceutical compositions may comprise between 1 mg to 10g of antigen binding protein, for example \n\n between 5mg and 1 g of antigen binding protein. Alternatively, the composition may comprise between 5mg and 500mg, for example between 5mg and 50mg. \n\n\nMethods for the preparation of such pharmaceutical compositions are well known to those skilled in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions may comprise between 1 mg to 10g of antigen binding protein in unit dosage form, optionally together with instructions for use. Pharmaceutical compositions may be lyophilised (freeze dried) for reconstitution prior to administration according to methods well known or apparent to those skilled in the art. Where antibodies have an lgG1 isotype, a chelator of copper, such as citrate (e.g. sodium citrate) or EDTA or histidine, may be added to the pharmaceutical composition to reduce the degree of copper-mediated degradation of antibodies of this isotype, see EP0612251. Pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise a solubiliser such as arginine base, a detergent/anti-aggregation agent such as polysorbate 80, and an inert gas such as nitrogen to replace vial headspace oxygen. \n\n\nEffective doses and treatment regimes for administering the antigen binding protein are generally determined empirically and may be dependent on factors such as the age, weight and health status of the patient and disease or disorder to be treated. Such factors are within the purview of the attending physician. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses may be found in e.g. Smith et al (1977) Antibodies in human diagnosis and therapy, Raven Press, New York. Thus the antigen binding protein of the invention may be administered at a therapeutically effective amount. \n\n\nThe dosage of antigen binding protein administered to a subject is generally between 1 μg/kg to 150 mg/kg, between 0.1 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, between 0.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, between 1 and 25 mg/kg or between 1 and 10 mg/kg of the subject's body weight. For example, the dose may be 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 60 mg/kg. The antigen binding protein may be administered parenterally, for example subcutaneously, intravenously or intramuscularly. \n\n\nIf desired, the effective daily dose of a therapeutic composition may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals, optionally, in unit dosage forms. For example, the dose may be administered subcutaneously, once every 14 or 28 days in the form of multiple sub-doses on each day of administration. \n\n The administration of a dose may be by intravenous infusion, typically over a period of from 15 minutes to 24 hours, such as from 2 to 12 hours, or from 2 to 6 hours. This may result in reduced toxic side effects. \n\n\nThe administration of a dose may be repeated one or more times as necessary, for example, three times daily, once every day, once every 2 days, once a week, once a fortnight, once a month, once every 3 months, once every 6 months, or once every 12 months. The antigen binding proteins may be administered by maintenance therapy, for example once a week for a period of 6 months or more. The antigen binding proteins may be administered by intermittent therapy, for example for a period of 3 to 6 months and then no dose for 3 to 6 months, followed by administration of antigen binding proteins again for 3 to 6 months, and so on in a cycle. \n\n\nThe dosage may be determined or adjusted by measuring the amount of IL-17 in a biological sample. Other means of determining or adjusting dosage may be utilized, including but not limited to biologic markers ('biomarkers') of pharmacology, measures of muscle mass and/or function, safety, tolerability, and therapeutic response. The antigen binding protein can be administered in an amount and for a duration effective to down- regulate IL-7 mediated signalling activity in the subject. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein may be administered to the subject in such a way as to target therapy to a particular site. For example, the antigen binding protein may be injected locally into muscle, for example skeletal muscle. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein may be used in combination with one or more other therapeutically active agents, for example: immunomodulators such as interferon beta (IFN3-1 a or IFN3-1 b) and glatiramer acetate, immunosuppresants such as \n\n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, cladribine, cydosporine and mitoxantrone, other immune therapies such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), plasma replacement and sulphasalazine. The additional therapeutic may be administered as in a manner (dosage, timing, mechanism) as prescribed by a physician. In an embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously or sequentially or separately from the antigen binding protein of the present invention. In an embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent and the antigen binding protein are administered such \n\n that their pharmacological effects on the patient overlap; in other words, they exert their biological effects on the patient at the same time. \n\n\nWhen the antigen binding protein is used in combination with other therapeutically active agents, the individual components may be administered either together or separately, sequentially or simultaneously, in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations, by any appropriate route. If administered separately or sequentially, the antigen binding protein and the therapeutically active agent(s) may be administered in any order. \n\n\nThe combinations referred to above may be presented for use in the form of a single pharmaceutical formulation comprising a combination as defined above optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. \n\n\nWhen combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the components must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the formulation and may be formulated for administration. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient formulation, for example in such a manner as known for antigen binding proteins in the art. \n\n\nWhen in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease, the dose of each component may differ from that when the antigen binding protein is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein and the therapeutically active agent(s) may act synergistically. In other words, administering the antigen binding protein and the therapeutically active agent(s) in combination may have a greater effect on the disease, disorder, or condition described herein than the sum of the effect of each alone. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition may comprise a kit of parts of the antigen binding protein together with other medicaments, optionally with instructions for use. For convenience, the kit may comprise the reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for use. \n\n\nThe terms \"individual\", \"subject\" and \"patient\" are used herein interchangeably. The subject is typically a human. The subject may also be a mammal, such as a mouse, rat or primate (e.g. a marmoset or monkey). The subject can be a non-human animal. The \n\n antigen binding proteins may also have veterinary use. The subject to be treated may be a farm animal for example, a cow or bull, sheep, pig, ox, goat or horse or may be a domestic animal such as a dog or cat. The animal may be any age, or a mature adult animal. \n\n\nTreatment may be therapeutic, prophylactic or preventative. The subject may be one who is in need thereof. Those in need of treatment may include individuals already suffering from a particular medical disease in addition to those who may develop the disease in the future. \n\n\nThus, the antigen binding protein described herein can be used for prophylactic or preventative treatment. In this case, the antigen binding protein described herein is administered to an individual in order to prevent or delay the onset of one or more aspects or symptoms of the disease. The subject can be asymptomatic. The subject may have a genetic predisposition to the disease. A prophylactically effective amount of the antigen binding protein is administered to such an individual. A prophylactically effective amount is an amount which prevents or delays the onset of one or more aspects or symptoms of a disease described herein. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein described herein may also be used in methods of therapy. The term \"therapy\" encompasses alleviation, reduction, or prevention of at least one aspect or symptom of a disease. For example, the antigen binding protein described herein may be used to ameliorate or reduce one or more aspects or symptoms of a disease described herein. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein described herein is used in an effective amount for therapeutic, prophylactic or preventative treatment. A therapeutically effective amount of the antigen binding protein described herein is an amount effective to ameliorate or reduce one or more aspects or symptoms of the disease. The antigen binding protein described herein may also be used to treat, prevent, or cure the disease described herein. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein described herein may have a generally beneficial effect on the subject's health, for example it can increase the subject's expected longevity. \n\n\nThe antigen binding protein described herein need not affect a complete cure, or eradicate every symptom or manifestation of the disease to constitute a viable therapeutic \n\n treatment. As is recognised in the pertinent field, drugs employed as therapeutic agents may reduce the severity of a given disease state, but need not abolish every manifestation of the disease to be regarded as useful therapeutic agents. Similarly, a prophylactically administered treatment need not be completely effective in preventing the onset of a disease in order to constitute a viable prophylactic agent. Simply reducing the impact of a disease (for example, by reducing the number or severity of its symptoms, or by increasing the effectiveness of another treatment, or by producing another beneficial effect), or reducing the likelihood that the disease will occur (for example by delaying the onset of the disease) or worsen in a subject, is sufficient. \n\n\nThe antigen binding proteins of the present invention may be used in the therapy of multiple sclerosis and in other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, particularly those in which pathogenic T\nH\n17 cells are implicated. Such diseases are associated with high levels of IL-17 expression. Elevated levels of IL-17 have been reported in serum and CSF of MS patients (Matusevicius, D. et al.; Mult. Scler. 5, 101-104; 1999) and in the synovial fluid obtained from rheumatoid arthritis patients. IL-17 has also been implicated in psoriasis (Homey et al.; J. Immunol. 164(12):6621 -32; 2000), while Hamzaoui et al reported high levels of IL-17 in Behcet's disease (Scand. J. Rhuematol.; 31 :4, 205-210; 2002). Elevated IL-17 levels have also been observed in systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE) (Wong et al.; Lupus 9(8):589-93; 2000). \n\n\nInhibition of IL-7 receptor mediated signalling may also be useful in the treatment of inflammatory (non-autoimmune) diseases in which elevated IL-17 has been implicated, such as asthma. \n\n\nAccordingly, inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases of the invention include inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis; systemic \n\n\nscleroderma and sclerosis; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); Crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; ischemic reperfusion disorders including surgical tissue reperfusion injury, myocardial ischemic conditions such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, reperfusion after cardiac surgery and constriction after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysms; cerebral edema secondary to stroke; cranial trauma, hypovolemic shock; asphyxia; adult respiratory distress syndrome; acute-lung injury; Behcet's Disease; dermatomyositis; polymyositis; multiple sclerosis (MS); dermatitis; meningitis; encephalitis; uveitis; osteoarthritis; lupus nephritis; \n\n autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjorgen's syndrome, vasculitis; diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis; central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorder, multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicaemia or trauma; alcoholic hepatitis; bacterial pneumonia; antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases including glomerulonephritis; sepsis; sarcoidosis; immunopathologic responses to tissue/organ transplantation; inflammations of the lung, including pleurisy, alveolitis, vasculitis, pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and cystic fibrosis; psoriatic arthritis; neuromyelitis optica, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), COPD, type 1 diabetes, etc. \n\n\nIn particular, the antagonists of the present invention may be useful in the therapy of multiple sclerosis, in all its forms, including neuromyelitis optica. Treatment with an antagonist of the present invention is predicted to be most efficacious when administered in the context of active inflammatory disease, i.e. when used in the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome or relapsing forms of MS. These stages of disease can be defined clinically and/or by imaging criteria such as gadolinium enhancement or other more sensitive techniques, and/or other as yet undefined biomarkers of active disease. \n\n\nParticularly, the antagonists of the invention can be used to treat RRMS (via intravenous, subcutaneous, oral or intramuscular delivery) when the patients are entering or are in relapse. In an embodiment, the antagonist of the invention is administered to the patient at the onset of relapse, or within 1 hr, 2hrs, 3hrs, 6hrs, 12hrs, 24hrs, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days or 10 days from the onset of relapse. \n\n\nThe antigen binding proteins of the invention are capable of binding to CD127. In an embodiment the antigen binding proteins of the invention are capable of antagonising the biological effect of the IL-7 receptor. In an embodiment, the antigen binding proteins are capable of antagonising at least one of: IL-7 receptor mediated T\nH\n17 expansion, and IL-7 receptor mediated T\nH\n17 survival. \n\n\nThe term inhibit, antagonise and neutralise are used herein synonymously. No term is intended to suggest the requirement of total neutralisation; partial neutralisation - corresponding to a reduction but not complete abolition of the biological effect - is also contemplated. \n\n IL-7 receptor mediated T\nH\n17 expansion and/or survival can be observed at a cellular level by an increase or maintenance of T\nH\n17 cell count, or by an increase in the ratio of T\nH\n17 cell numbers compared to the numbers of other CD4+ T cells, or more specifically by an increase in the ratio of T\nH\n17:T\nH\n1 cells, the ratio of T\nH\n17:T\nre\ng cells, the ratio of (T\nH\n17 plus T\nH\n1 ):T\nre\ng cells, and/or the ratio of T\nH\n17:(T\nH\n1 plus T\nreg\n) cells. \n\n\nAt a molecular level, T\nH\n17 expansion and/or survival can be observed by an increase in IL-17 production by a population of CD4+ T cells (or by a population of T\nH\n17 cells). In an embodiment, therefore, the antigen binding proteins of the invention reduce IL-17 production by a population of CD4+ T cells. IL-7 receptor mediated T\nH\n17 expansion and survival can also be observed by an increase in IFN-γ production by a population of CD4+ T cells (or by a population of T\nH\n17 cells). Thus, in an embodiment, the antigen binding proteins of the invention antagonise (reduce) IFN-γ production by a population of CD4+ T cells. At a molecular level, the antigen binding proteins of the invention may inhibit IL-7 receptor mediated STAT-5 phosphorylation. \n\n\nAt the molecular level, one can observe and measure the blocking effect of the antigen binding proteins of the invention by assays such as IL-7-induced P-STAT5 or Bcl-2. At the cellular level, one can observe and measure the blocking effect by assays such as Th17 secretion of IL-17 or IFNy. Exemplary assays are described in PCT application number PCT/US2009/053136 (WO2010/017468). \n\n\nIn an exemplary pSTAT-5 assay, PBMCs are stimulated with IL-7 in the presence and absence of a test agent. Cells are subsequently assessed quantitatively for the level of pSTAT-5, e.g. by staining for pSTAT-5 (e.g. with a labelled anti-pSTAT-5 antibody, such as Alexa Fluor® 647 Mouse Anti-Stat5 (pY694, BD [#612599])) followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting. The levels of phosphorylated STAT-5 could also be determined by ELISA. Those agents which reduce the level of phosphorylated STAT-5 may be potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune disease. \n\n\nThe antagonist may be capable of reducing levels of phosphorylated STAT-5 by at least 20%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% when compared to STAT-5 levels in the absence of the antagonist, or when compared to a negative control, or untreated cells. The antagonist may have an IC\n5\no of 50μg/ml, 25μg/ml or less, ^g/ml or less, 5μg/ml or less, or 2μg/ml or less. In an embodiment, the antagonist has an IC\n50\n of less than or equal \n\n to 1 μς/ηιΙ, less than or equal to Ο./δμς/ηιΙ, less than or equal to 0^g/ml, less than or equal to 0.25μ9/ηΊΐ, or less than or equal to 0.1 μς/ηιΙ. \n\n\nThe antagonists of the invention are particularly effective in inhibiting the expansion of T\nH\n17 cells. Expansion of T\nH\n17 cells can be determined in a T\nH\n17 expansion assay, which comprises stimulating a population of naive T cells to expand in the presence and absence of a test agent, followed by stimulating the cells to produce IL-17 and assessing the level of IL-17 produced by the cells in the presence and absence of the test agent. \n\n\nIn an exemplary assay, human CD4+ T cells are differentiated into T\nH\n17 by stimulation with T cell receptor activation in the presence of IL-1 , IL-6, and IL-23. After 5 days of differentiation, CCR6+ cells are sorted out to produce an enriched T\nH\n17 population. This population is then stimulated with human IL-7 and the increase in IL-17 and IFN-γ in the supernatant are determined. The ability of a test agent, such as an antigen binding fragment of the present invention to block the interaction between the IL-7 and CD 127 can be determined as the presence of an antagonist of this interaction during the incubation period should prevent the expansion of the T\nH\n17 cells leading to the reduction of IL-17 and IFN-γ production. \n\n\nThe antigen binding proteins of the invention may be capable of from 20% or more inhibition of IL-17 secretion in such an assay, versus a negative control. More typically, the antigen binding protein is capable of from 50%, from 75%, from 85% or from 90% or more inhibition of IL-17 secretion versus the control. The antigen binding fragment may, in some embodiments, exhibit an IC\n50\n of less than or equal to 50μg/ml in the assay. In other embodiments, the IC\n50\n may be less than or equal to 20μg/ml, 10μg/ml or 5μg/ml. \n\n\nThus, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for the treatment of an autoimmune disease or inflammatory disorder, comprising administering to a patient an antigen binding protein of the invention in an amount sufficient to reduce the T\nH\n17 cell count in the patient. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for the treatment of an autoimmune disease in a human subject, comprising administering to the subject an antigen binding protein in an amount sufficient to reduce IL-7 receptor mediated STAT-5 phosphorylation. \n\n In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating multiple sclerosis in a patient comprising administering an antigen binding protein of the invention to the patient, wherein the patient is suffering from relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating an autoimmune or inflammatory disease in a human subject, comprising administering to the subject an antigen binding protein of the invention to the patient in an amount effective to reduce the ratio of T\nH\n17 cells relative to T\nH\n1 cells. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating an autoimmune or inflammatory disease in a human subject, comprising administering to the subject an antigen binding protein of the invention to the patient in an amount effective to reduce the ratio of T\nH\n cells relative to (Foxp3+) T\nreg\n cells. \n\n\nDiagnostic methods of use \n\n\nThe antigen binding proteins described herein may be used to detect CD127 in a biological sample in vitro or in vivo for diagnostic purposes. For example, the anti-CD127 antigen binding proteins can be used to detect CD127 in cultured cells, in a tissue or in serum. The tissue may have been first removed (for example a biopsy) from a human or animal body. Conventional immunoassays may be employed, including ELISA, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, or immunoprecipitation. \n\n\nThe antigen binding proteins may be provided in a diagnostic kit comprising one or more antigen binding proteins, a detectable label, and instructions for use of the kit. For convenience, the kit may comprise the reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for use. \n\n\nGene therapy \n\n\nNucleic acid molecules encoding the antigen binding proteins described herein may be administered to a subject in need thereof. The nucleic acid molecule may express the CDRs in an appropriate scaffold or domain, the variable domain, or the full length antibody. The nucleic acid molecule may be comprised in a vector which allows for expression in a human or animal cell. The nucleic acid molecule or vector may be \n\n formulated for administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and/or one or more therapeutically active agents as discussed above. \n\n\nExamples \n\n\n1.0 Humanization of 1 A1 1 \n\n\n1.1 1 A1 1 Cloning of the hybridoma variable regions \n\n\nTotal RNA was prepared from a cell pellets of the 1 A1 1 hybridomas and RT-PCR performed to generate cDNA of the variable regions.

The germline V region was combined in silico with a suitable FR4, in this case the J-region kappa 2 minigene (Kabat Vol. II) based on sequence similarity. The first two residues of the JK-2 minigene residues fall within the CDR3 region and are identical to the last two residues in the mouse 6A3 light chain CDR3.

These modifications render the molecule less able to recruit immune effector cells or complement. The resulting VH construct is identified as 1 A1 1 H3-Fc, and has a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:1 18 (encoded by a polynucleotide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 19). The antibody comprising 1A1 1 H3-Fc and the 1A1 1.L4 light chain (1A1 1 H3L4Fc) was further analysed as described in Example 4 below. \n\n\n2.6 Affinity Maturation of 1 A1 1 H3L4 \n\n\n2.6.1 Construction of recombinant anti-IL7R 1 A1 1 H3L4 CDRH3 variants \n\n\nA number of variants of the humanised anti-IL7R monoclonal antibody 1A1 1 H3L4 were produced. These all differed by only one amino acid substitution in the CDRH3 region of the heavy chain of the antibody having the heavy chain amino acid sequence set out in \n\n SEQ ID NO:1 14 (H3), and the light chain amino acid sequence set out in SEQ ID NO:1 15 (L4). \n\n\nHumanised CDRH3 variants of 1 A1 1 H3L4 within the pLEFD mammalian expression vector were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. \n\n\n2.6.2 Small scale antibody expression in HEK 293 6E cells pLEFN and pLEFD plasmids encoding the light and heavy chains of 1 A1 1 H3L4 and CDRH3 variants respectively were transiently co-transfected into HEK 293 6E cells at 96- well scale (500μΙ expression volume) using 293fectin (Invitrogen, 12347019). \n\n\nSupernatants were harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 1500rpm. The supernatants containing antibody were then filtered using a 0.45μηη filtration plate. \n\n\nAntibodies were assessed directly from the tissue culture supernatant. \n\n\n2.6.3 Proteon analysis of anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 CDRH3 variants \n\n\nThe initial screen to determine the binding affinity of the CDRH3 antibody variants (which were derived from small scale antibody expressions in HEK 293 6E cells and assessed directly from the tissue culture supernatant, as described in Example 2.6.2) was carried out on the ProteOn XPR36 (Biorad). The method was as follows; Protein A was immobilised on a GLC chip by primary amine coupling, CDRH3 mutant antibodies were then captured on this surface and IL7R passed over at 256, 64, 16, 4, 1 nM with a OnM injection (i.e. buffer alone) used to double reference the binding curves. 50mM NaOH was used to regenerate the capture surface, removing the bound CDRH3 mutant antibodies ready for another cycle of capture and analyte injection. The data was fitted to the 1 :1 model using the analysis software inherent to the machine. Binding analysis for mutant antibodies was carried out directly from tissue culture supernatants. \n\n\nThe screen identified several antibodies that appeared to have better kinetic profiles than the parental molecule (1 A1 1 H3L4). The data obtained from this analysis is shown in 4.2.3, showing that several CDRH3 mutations at the N98 and F100b residues appeared to improve the binding affinity to IL7R. From this data set, six molecules were selected for further analysis (Example 2.6.4). \n\n2.6.4 Larger scale antibody expression in HEK 293 6E cells \n\n\nThe data highlighted that several CDRH3 mutations at the N98 and F100b residues appeared to improve the binding affinity to IL7R (data shown in 4.2.3). Therefore, purified antibody was produced for these six CDRH3 variants. Constructs encoding the heavy and light chain of 1 A1 1 H3L4 CDRH3 variants were sub-cloned from the pLEFD and pLEFN plasmids into the pTT vector for optimal large scale HEK 293 6E expression. Plasmids were transiently co-transfected into 50-100ml of HEK 293 6E (plasmid details summarised in Table 7) using 293fectin (Invitrogen, 12347019). A tryptone feed was added to the cell culture after 24 hours and the cells were harvested after a further 72 hours. Antibody was then affinity purified using immobilised Protein A columns and quantified by reading the absorbance at 280nm. \n\n\n3.0 Construction of humanised vectors \n\n\n The DNA sequences of the humanised variable regions were sequence optimised using the LETO 1.0 software (Entelechon GmbH) and synthesised de novo by build up of overlapping oligonucleotide and PCR amplification. Primers included restriction sites for cloning into mammalian expression vectors and human immunoglobulin signal sequences for secretion. The humanised variable heavy regions were cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing the human gamma 1 constant region using Age1/Kas1 . In parallel, the humanised variable light regions were cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing the human kappa constant region using Hindi 11 and BsiWI. \n\n\n4.0 Characterisation of humanised antibodies \n\n\n4.1 Determination of binding kinetics of 1A1 1 and 6A3 constructs: BIAcore™ 3000 \n\n\nThe binding kinetics of the anti-CD127 antibodies for human CD127 ECD was assessed using a BIAcore 3000 device (GE Healthcare). Humanised 6A3 or 1A1 1 constructs were captured on a CM5 biosensor chip which was already immobilized BIAcore (GE \n\n\nHealthcare cat# BR-1008-39) anti-human IgG (Fc specific) monoclonal antibody using supplied coupling buffer. A range of human CD127 ECD concentrations (512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16nM) were injected for 240s at a flow rate of 30ul/min. \n\n\n1 ) Capture MAb of interest \n\n 2) Association of Analyte to captured MAb \n\n\n 3) Dissociation of Analyte (buffer) \n\n\n 4) Regenerate with BIAcore optimized buffer.

Kinetics were determined by global fitting of data to the 1 :1 Langmuir model using BIAevaluation software. Results are shown in Example 4.2.1 (1A1 1 ) and 4.2.2 (6A3). \n\n\n4.1 .1 Determination of binding kinetics of selected 1 A1 1 H3L4 CDRH3 variants \n\n\nBIAcore™ analysis was used to determine the binding affinity of the purified CDRH3 mutant antibodies (which were derived from larger scale antibody expressions in HEK 293 6E cells, as described in Example 2.6.4). \n\n\n4.1 .1 .1 Method 1 : BIAcore™ T100 \n\n\nAn anti-human IgG (GE Healthcare/BIAcore™ BR-1008-39) was immobilised on a CM3 chip by primary amine coupling to a level of -1300 resonance units (RU's), CDRH3 mutant antibodies were then captured on this, all the antibodies were captured to a similar level (44-56 RU's) and IL-7R passed over at 256, 64, 16, 4, 1 nM with a OnM injection (i.e. buffer alone) used to double reference the binding curves, regeneration of this surface was achieved using 3M MgCI\n2\n. The binding data was fitted to the 1 :1 model inherent to the BIAcore™ T100 analysis software. The run was carried out using HBS-EP as running buffer and carried out at 25°C on the BIAcore™ T100. Results are shown in 4.2.4. \n\n\n4.1 .1 .2: Method 2: BIAcore™ 3000 \n\n\nAn anti-human IgG (GE Healthcare/BIAcore™ BR-1008-39) was immobilised on a CM5 chip by primary amine coupling to a level of -5400 resonance units (RU's), CDRH3 mutant antibodies were then captured on this surface, all the antibodies were captured to a similar level (175-205 RU's) and IL7R passed over at 64, 16, 4, 1 nM with a OnM injection (i.e. buffer alone) used to double reference the binding curves, regeneration of this surface was achieved using 3M MgCI\n2\n. The binding data was fitted to the 1 :1 model \n\n inherent to the BIAcore™ 3000 analysis software. The run was carried out using HBS-EP as running buffer and carried out at 25°C on the BIAcore™ 3000. Results are shown in 4.2.5. \n\n\n4.1 .2 Determination of species cross-reactivity of 1A1 1 H3L4 in Cvnomolqus and Marmoset \n\n\nThe binding kinetics of 1 A1 1 H3L4 for Cynomolgus and Marmoset CD127 ECD was assessed using a Biacore 3000. 1 A1 1 H3L4 was captured on a CM5 biosensor chip which was already immobilized BIAcore (GE Healthcare cat# BR-1008-39) anti-human IgG (Fc specific) monoclonal antibody. The antibody surfaces were regenerated with 3 M MgCI\n2\n. Kinetics was determined by global fitting of data to the 1 :1 Langmuir model using \n\n\nBIAevaluation software. Results are shown in 4.3. \n\n\n4.1 .3 IL7 Receptor inhibition assay \n\n\nBIAcore™ analysis was also used to demonstrate that the purified CDRH3 mutant antibodies (which were derived from larger scale antibody expressions in HEK 293 6E cells, as described in Example 2.6.4) were able to inhibit the interaction between IL7 and IL7R. \n\n\nIL7 (R&D Systems) was immobilised on a CM5 chip by primary amine coupling; the surface was conditioned with 10mM glycine, pH3.0 to provide a stable surface for the neutralisation assay. IL7R at 64nM was incubated with the test antibodies at \n\n\nconcentrations of 256nM, 128nM, 64nM, 16nM, 8nM, 4nM, 2nM and 1 nM in run 1 and of 256nM, 128nM, 64nM, 16nM, 8nM, 4nM, 2nM, 1 nM, 0.5nM and 0.25nM in run 2. Samples were then incubated at room temperature for 3hrs before being run over the IL7/CM5 chip, 10mM glycine, pH3.0 was used to regenerate the surface for the next interaction. IC\n50\n values were calculated using Robosage, whereby the binding signals were converted into percentage values based around the maximum signal achieved using IL7R at 64nM with OnM antibody.

This is likely to be due to the fact that IL7R is a homodimer and therefore the amount of avidity and cross linking of the antibodies with the antigen may increase or decrease dependent on the different densities of IL7R immobilised by the different capture surfaces used in the two assays. Despite the different affinities seen between the two runs the ranking in the two experiments shows that BPC4398 (1 A1 1 H3L4 N98D) has an improved affinity over the parental molecule 1A1 1 H3L4. \n\n 4.3 Species cross-reactivity \n\n\n1A1 1 H3L4 (wild type) was observed to cross react with marmoset and cynomolgus IL-7R tested at a comparable level by Biacore system (Table 10). \n\n\nTABLE 10: 1A11 H3L4 with Human IL7R, Mouse IL7R and Cynomolgus IL7R Comparison \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Epitope binding by X-ray crystallography \n\n\n Using a 1 A1 1 H3L4 Fab, X-ray crystallography coupled with in silico modelling was used to predict binding interfaces for the mAbs to help provide mechanistic insight into the functional neutralization observed, and to make rational choices for antibody maturation. A high resolution (2.08A) structure of 1A1 1 H3L4 Fab/human IL7 receptor complex was established. Human IL7 Receptor extracellular domain and 1A1 1 H3L4 were expressed in CHO lec cells and purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The Fab fragment of 1 A1 1 H3L4 was generated by papain cleavage. Fab1 A1 1 H3L4/IL7R ECD complex was generated by mixing 1 :1.2 molar ratio of Fab1 A1 1 H3L4 with \n\n\nIL7Receptor ECD. Proteins were concentrated and crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source in the Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were indexed and scaled using the HKL2000 software. The structure was determined by molecular replacement in the program X-PLOR. The initial molecular replacement solution was subject to multiple rounds of molecular dynamics refinement in CNX and rebuilding with the program \n\n\nWinCoot. \n\n\n Based on the high resolution 2.08A crystal structure, it is predicted that 1A1 1 H3L4 binds IL7 Receptor at 4 of the IL-7R extracellular loops, thereby blocking IL7-ligand binding: \n\n\n Loop 2: 55Gly 56Ala 57Leu 58Val 59Glu 60Val 61 Lys \n\n\n Loop 3: 80Leu 81 Leu 82lle 83Gly 84Lys 100Lys \n\n Loop 4: 138Lys 139Tyr 142Val \n\n\n Loop5: 192Tyr 193Phe \n\n\nThese findings are consistent with the observed competition for binding to hi L7 observed between 1A1 1 and 6A3. \n\n\n4.5 Analysis of Effector Functions \n\n\n 4.5.1 1A1 1 H3L4 lacks complement-mediate cytotoxicity \n\n\nA total of six separate experiments showed that 1 A1 1 H3L4 (wild type) had no measurable complement-mediated cytotoxicity. These experiments were performed with a hlL-7r BacMam transduced HEK 293 MSR II cell line used as the target. These cells were transduced (moi 75) for -21 hours at 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n in T175 culture flasks. The adherent cells were then removed from the flasks using TrypLE and washed several times before plating at 1x10\n5\n cells/50ul/well into a 96-well plate. 25μΙ of antibody was added for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n. Following this incubation, 20μΙ of rabbit complement was added and the plate and then returned to the incubator for 2 hours. An assessment of cell viability was carried out by adding 10ΟμΙ of CellTiter-Glo to each well with gentle mixing using a multichannel pipet. The plate was then read for luminescence signal on a Victor V plate reader (viable cells have increased signal). An example of one of those experiments is shown in Figure 1 . \n\n\nThe positive control antibody (Grits 32092) used in the above experiment was specific towards a cell-surface receptor for HER3 that was co-expressed on the same target cell which expressed the hlL-7Ra. This control antibody was used at the same concentration as 1A1 1 H3L4 (10 μg/ml), and was combined with the same two sources of rabbit complement (Calbiochem and Invitrogen). These results showed that both the target cells and complement which were used in the assay were able to induce complement dependent cytotoxicity. \n\n\n4.5.2 1 A1 1 H3L4Fc has reduced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) \n\n\nPurified peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seven human donors were profiled as effector cells in an ADCC assay. These experiments were performed with a hlL-7r BacMam transduced HEK 293 MSR II cell line used as the target cell. These cells were transduced (moi 75) for -21 hours at 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n in T175 culture flasks. These adherent cells were then removed from the flasks using Tryple and washed several times \n\n before \"loading\" with europium. These loaded cells were combined into a 96-well plate (2x10\n4\n cells/25ul/well) which contained anti-IL-7R antibody for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n. After incubation, effector cells were added at ratios of 200, 100, 50 and 25:1 (1 ΟΟμΙ/well) and returned to 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n for 2 hours. Following this incubation, 25μΙ of supernatant was removed and added to a 96-well plate containing Ι ΟΟμΙ/well of Delfia enhancement solution. The plate was then incubated on a room temperature plate shaker for 5 minutes and then read in a Victor V plate reader. Any europium released by lysed cells into the surrounding supernatant (cell cytotoxicity) was measured as fluorescent units. \n\n\nThese assays compared the ability of \"wild-type\" 1 A1 1 H3L4 and the Fc-disabled molecule 1 A1 1 H3L4Fc to bind human effector cells via their Fc receptors, and kill IL-7 receptor positive target cells. The overall results from these experiments showed that the Fc-disabled 1 A1 1 H3L4Fc was at least 2-fold less potent in initiating antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity than \"wild-type\" 1 A1 1 H3L4. These results also showed that in six out of seven donors the disabled antibody was capable of inducing some level of ADCC activity (one donor showed little activity with both wild-type and disabled 1 A1 1 H3L4). The results are shown in Figure 2. \n\n\n4.5.3 Fc receptor binding \n\n\n1 A1 1 H3L4 and 1 A1 1 H3L4Fc were assessed for their ability to bind to multiple Fc effector receptors (Fc Gamma I, lla and Ilia), and FcRn of numerous species and compared to control wild-type and Fc disabled antibodies. The work was carried out on the ProteOn XPR36 surface plasmon resonance machine (BioRad). The antibodies to be tested were coupled to a GLM biosensor chip by primary amine coupling. The various Fey receptors were used as analytes at 2048nM, 512nM, 128nM, 32nM and 8nM using HBS- EP (pH7.4) as running buffer. For FcRn receptor binding, human, cyno, mouse and rat FcRn were used as analyte at 2048nM, 512nM, 128nM, 32nM and 8nM, with the run being carried out at pH6.0 and pH7.4. All binding sensograms were double referenced with a OnM injection (i.e. buffer alone). The data was fitted to the Equilibrium model inherent to the ProteOn analysis software. \n\n\nTable 1 1 shows the affinities generated for the antibody binding to the various Fc receptors assessed in this study, and shows that 1A1 1 H3L4 and 1A1 1 H3L4Fc behaved \n\n in a comparable manner to their control antibody counterparts. The disabled Fc antibodies (1 A1 1 H3L4Fc) showed either no binding or a much reduced binding for Fey receptors and hence accurate analysis could not be carried out. The data for FcRn binding showed that the Fc disabled and Fc wild type had similar affinities for all species tested, the data in the table is for the pH6.0 assay, binding was either absent or much reduced at pH7.4 as expected. \n\n\nTable 11: Binding affinities of 1A11 H3L4 (Fc disabled and wt Fc) to Fc Receptors (nM) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 In vitro potency assays \n\n\n4.6.1 Inhibition of IL-7 stimulated STAT5 phosphorylation by 1A1 1 and 1A1 1 H3L4 \n\n\n For screening functional antibody to IL-7Ra, hybridoma culture medium, positive control antibody or testing supernatant samples were incubated with PBMC cells for 30mins before stimulating with IL-7. The untreated cells were analyzed as the background signal, while IL-7 treated cells were set as negative control. After 30mins incubation with the controls or testing samples, the cells were stimulated with IL-7 for 15mins at 37°C. Cells then were fixed 1 .6% of paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10min at 37°C and were \n\n\n permeabilized in 100% methanol for 20-30 mins. Cells then were washed twice in stain buffer (1 % BSA in PBS) and stained with Alexa-647 labelled anti-pStat5 antibody (BD Biosciences Inc #612599) for 1 hr. Samples were analyzed on BD LSR II FACS instrument. \n\n The parental 1 A1 1 monoclonal antibody blocks I L-7 induction of STAT5 phosphorylation in human PBMC with an IC50 of 0.088 ug/ml (data not shown). 1 A1 1 H3L4 was tested in the same assay using PBMCs from two donors at two human I L-7 concentrations (0.1 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml). 1A1 1 H3L4 demonstrated a very similar IC50 (average=0.087 ug/ml) compared to 1A1 1 indicating that the humanization process did not affect the ability of the antibody to inhibit IL-7-induced pSTAT5 (Figure 3A and 3B). \n\n\n4.6.2 Inhibition of I L-7-induced I L-17 production by 1A1 1 H3L4 \n\n\n1A1 1 H3L4 was assayed according to the following protocol, to determine its ability to inhibit Th17 expansion. CD4+ cells were isolated according to the manual (#130-091 -155, Miltenyi). Approximately 1 x10\n6\n/ml of the CD4+ cells in 100 μΙ were mixed with equal volume of a 2x concentration of Th17 differentiation medium (2 g/m\\ anti-CD28 + 10μg/ml anti-I FN-Y +\n\n\n anti-I L-4 + 12.5ng/ml I L-1 β + 20ng/ml I L-23 + 50ng/ml IL-6) and cultured in 37°C with 5% C0\n2\n for 5 days. Treatment by the various cytokines and growth factors in the Th17 medium preferentially differentiated the CD4+ cells into Th 17 cells. CCR6+ cells from the differentiated cultured cells at day 5 were sorted using BD FACS SORP Aria II . The CCR6+ cells were then adjusted to 2 x10\n6\n/ml for the I L-17 production assay. \n\n\nTo measure I L-17 and IFN-γ level, 100μΙ of CCR6+ cells were pre-incubated with testing antibody for 1 h at 37°C, and then mixed with 100μΙ of 10ng/ml IL-7. The cells were cultured for 24-40 hours in 37°C with supplement of 5% C0\n2\n. I FN-γ and I L-17 levels in 100 μΙ of culture supernatant were measured by FlowCytomix (Bender MedSystems) at 24 h and 40 h, respectively. \n\n\n1 A1 1 H3L4 was tested in the Th17 expansion assay in a total of four human CD4+ cell samples (Figures 4A-D). The humanized antibody demonstrated significant inhibition of I L-17 production in two samples and trends of inhibition in the other two samples. Given the donor-to-donor variation in this assay, we conclude that 1 A1 1 H3L4 is able to block I L- 7-mediated Th 17 cell expansion. \n\n\n4.6.3 Effects on TSLP signalling \n\n The IL-7Ra subunit is shared by both the IL-7R and the TSLP receptor complex (TSLPR). The effect of 1 A1 1 H3L4 on TSLP signaling was tested in an in vitro assay based on TSLP-induction of TARC production by human blood monocytes. A commercial anti IL- 7Ra antibody, R34.34, was used as a positive control for blocking TSLP-induction of TARC. Furthermore an Fc-disabled humanized lgG1 (HulgGI ; GRITS39633) was also used as a negative control. Monocytes from 5 donors were used, with TSLP used at 1 ng/ml, 1A1 1 H3L4 and HulgGI used at doses of 0.001-30Mg/ml, and R34.34 used at 0.4, 2, and 10 μg/ml. Cell survival was also assessed by cell counting. \n\n\n1 A1 1 H3L4 did not affect TSLP-induction of TARC as shown in Figures 5A-E, whilst for the same 5 donors, R34.34 substantially inhibited TARC production. The humanized negative control antibody had no effect on TARC production. This data set shows that 1A1 1 H3L4 does not neutralize TSLP signaling in human monocytes. Therefore it is anticipated that 1 A1 1 H3L4 is specific for neutralization of IL-7 signaling through IL-7R and does not impact upon TSLP signaling through TSLPR. \n\n\n4.7 IL7 Receptor inhibition assay \n\n\n Table 12A shows the IC\n50\n values obtained in run 1 and shows that all of the constructs had better IC\n50\n values than the best value obtained for the parental 1 A1 1 H3L4 molecule and that the top two molecules were BPC4401 (Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 F100bH) and BPC4398 (1 A1 1 VH3 N98D L4). Table 12B shows the IC\n50\n values obtained in run 2, and also shows that both the constructs, BPC4401 (Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 F100bH) and BPC4398 (1 A1 1 VH3 N98D L4) had better IC\n50\n values than the best value obtained for the parental 1 A1 1 H3L4 molecule. Runs 1 and 2 were carried out on separate IL7R/CM5 surfaces. \n\n\nTABLE 12A: IC50s Receptor inhibition assay (Run1) \n\n\nMolecule identifier/number Molecule description IC50 (nM) \n\n\n BPC1 142(GRITS37988) Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 19.42 \n\n\n Replicate 1 \n\n\n BPC4398 Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 N98D 14.94 \n\n\n (CDRH3 variant) \n\n\n BPC4399 Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 N98E 15.8 \n\n\n (CDRH3 variant) \n\n BPC4400 Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 F100bE 15.33 \n\n\n (CDRH3 variant) \n\n\n BPC4401 Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 F100bH 14.75 \n\n\n (CDRH3 variant) \n\n\n BPC4402 Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 F100bl 15.23 \n\n\n (CDRH3 variant) \n\n\n BPC4403 Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 F100bV 15.54 \n\n\n (CDRH3 variant) \n\n\n BPC1 142 (HEK1029) Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 16.21\n\n\nBPC1 142(GRITS37988) Anti-IL7R 1A1 1 H3L4 17.23 Replicate 2 \n\n\n The parental molecule (BPC1 142-anti-IL7R 1 A1 1 H3L4) was run multiple times within the experiment using CHO expressed material (GRITS37988) and HEK expressed material (HEK1029). \n\n\nTABLE 12B: IC50s Receptor inhibition assay (Run 2) \n\n\n \n\n 4.8 IL-7R Polymorph binding assay \n\n\n IL-7R exists as two polymorphic forms, variant 1 : Thr66-lle128, variant 2: Ile66-Thr128. Binding of 1 A1 1 H3L4 to both polymorphic forms was assayed. An anti-human IgG (GE Healthcare/BIAcore™ BR-1008-39) was immobilised on a CM5 chip by primary amine coupling to a level of -9000 resonance units (RU's), 1 A1 1 H3L4 was then captured on this surface, and IL7R passed over at 512n, 256n, 128n, 64nnM, 32nM and 16nM with a OnM injection (i.e. buffer alone) used to double reference the binding curves, regeneration of this surface was achieved using 3M MgCI2. The binding data was fitted to the 1 :1 model inherent to the BIAcore™ 3000 analysis software. The run was carried out using HBS-EP as running buffer and carried out at 25°C on the BIAcore™ 3000. Table 13 shows the data obtained and showed that 1 A1 1 H3L4 had the same or similar binding affinity to both polymorphic variants (i.e. it binds to both polymorphs). \n\n\nTABLE 13: IL-7R polymorph binding \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this specification the invention has been described, with reference to embodiments, in a way which enables a clear and concise specification to be written.

Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nTRIAZOLE BETA CARBOLINE DERIVATIVES AS ANTIDIABETIC COMPOUNDS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION The instant invention is concerned with substituted beta-carboline derivatives, which are selective antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) which are useful for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, obesity, lipid disorders, and hypertension. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of depression and anxiety,\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDiabetes is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. Ln type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced by islet cells in the pancreas. Patients having Type 2 diabetes have a resistance to the effects of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, including muscle, liver and adipose tissues. These patients often have normal levels of insulin, and may have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels), as they compensate for the reduced effectiveness of insulin by secreting increased amounts of insulin (Polonsky, Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 24 Suppl 2:S29-31, 2000). The beta cells within the pancreatic islets initially compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Insulin resistance is not primarily caused by a diminished number of insulin receptors but rather by a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet completely understood. This lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle, and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver. Eventually, a patient may be become diabetic due to the inability to properly compensate for insulin resistance. In humans, the onset of Type 2 diabetes due to insufficient increases (or actual declines) in beta cell mass is apparently due to increased beta cell apoptosis relative to non-diabetic insulin resistant individuals (Butler et ah, Diabetes 52:102-110, 2003).\n\n\nPersistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs with diabetes is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. \n\n Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, effective therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nPatients who have insulin resistance often exhibit several symptoms that together are referred to as syndrome X or Metabolic Syndrome. According to one widely used definition, a patient having Metabolic Syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity, (2) hypertriglyceridemia, (3) low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), (4) high blood pressure, and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the Third Report of the . National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III), National Institutes of Health, 2001 , NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with Metabolic Syndrome, whether they have or develop overt diabetes mellitus, have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that occur with Type 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.\n\n\nThere are several available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, each of which has its own limitations and potential risks. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories often dramatically improves the diabetic condition and are the usual recommended first-line treatment of Type 2 diabetes and of pre-diabetic conditions associated with insulin resistance. Compliance with this treatment is generally very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of fat and carbohydrates. Pharmacologic treatments have largely focused on three areas of pathophysiology: (1) hepatic glucose production (biguanides), (2) insulin resistance (PPAR agonists), (3) insulin secretion (sulfonylureas); (4) incretin hormone mimetics (GLP-I derivatives and analogs, such as exenatide and luraglitide); and (5) inhibitors of incretin hormone degradation (DPP-4 inhibitors). The biguanides belong to a class of drugs that are widely used to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nPhenformin and metformin are the two best known biguanides and do cause some correction of hyperglycemia. The biguanides act primarily by inhibiting hepatic glucose production, and they also are believed to modestly improve insulin sensitivity. The biguanides can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs, such as insulin or insulin secretagogues, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, phenformin and metformin can induce lactic acidosis, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Metformin has a lower risk of side effects than phenformin and is widely prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. \n\n The glitazones (e.g., 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a class of compounds that can ameliorate hyperglycemia and other symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. The glitazones that are currently marketed (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype. The PPAR-gamma agonists substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of elevated plasma glucose levels without the occurrence of hypoglycemia. PPAR-gamma agonism is believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed in human patients who are treated with the glitazones. New PPAR agonists are currently being developed. Many of the newer PPAR compounds are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes. The currently marketed PPAR gamma agonists are modestly effective in reducing plasma glucose and hemoglobinAlC. The currently marketed compounds do not greatly improve lipid metabolism and may actually have a negative effect on the lipid profile. Thus, the PPAR compounds represent an important advance in diabetic therapy. Another widely used drug treatment involves the administration of insulin secretagogues, such as the sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide, glipizide, and glimepiride). These drugs increase the plasma level of insulin by stimulating the pancreatic β-cells to secrete more insulin. Insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell is under strict regulation by glucose and an array of metabolic, neural and hormonal signals. Glucose stimulates insulin production and secretion through its metabolism to generate ATP and other signaling molecules, whereas other extracellular signals act as potentiators or inhibitors of insulin secretion through GPCR's present on the plasma membrane. Sulfonylureas and related insulin secretagogues act by blocking the ATP-dependent K+ channel in β-cells, which causes depolarization of the cell and the opening of the voltage- dependent Ca2+ channels with stimulation of insulin release. This mechanism is non-glucose dependent, and hence insulin secretion can occur regardless of the ambient glucose levels. This can cause insulin secretion even if the glucose level is low, resulting in hypoglycemia, which can be fatal in severe cases. The administration of insulin secretagogues must therefore be carefully controlled. The insulin secretagogues are often used as a first-line drug treatment for Type 2 diabetes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin) provide a new route to increase insulin secretion in response to food consumption. Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-I) levels increase in response to the increases in glucose present after eating and glucagon stimulates the production of insulin. The serine proteinase enzyme DPP-4 which is present on many cell surfaces degrades GLP-I . DPP-4 inhibitors reduce degradation of GLP-I , thus potentiating its action and allowing for greater insulin production in response to increases in glucose through eating. \n\n There has been a renewed focus on pancreatic islet-based insulin secretion that is controlled by glucose-dependent insulin secretion. This approach has the potential for stabilization and restoration of β-cell function. In this regard, the present application claims compounds that are antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) as a means to increase insulin secretion in response to rises in glucose resulting from eating a meal. These compounds may also be used as ligands for imaging (e.g., PET, SPECT) for assessment of beta cell mass and islet function. A decrease in β-cell mass can be determined with respect to a particular patient over the course of time.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to compounds of structural formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese bicyclic beta-carboline derivatives are effective as antagonists of SSTR3.

(Lahlou et al, Ann. KY. Acad, ScL /0/4:121-131, 2004, Reisine ef α/., Endocrine Review 16 :427-442, 1995.) The predominant active forms of somatostatin are somatostatin- 14 and somatostatin-28. Somatostatin- 14 is a cyclic tetradecapeptide. Somatostatin-28 is an extended form of somatostatin- 14.\n\n\nSomatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) is the third of five related G-protein receptor subtypes responding to somatostatin. The other receptors are the somatostatin subtype receptor 1 (SSTRl ), somatostatin subtype receptor 2 (SSTR2), somatostatin subtype receptor 4 (SSTR4) \n\n and somatostatin subtype receptor 5 (SSTR5). The five distinct subtypes are encoded by separate genes segregated on different chromosomes. (Patel et al, Neuroendocrinal. 20:157-198, 1999). All five receptor subtypes bind somatostatin- 14 and somatostatin-28, with low nanomolar affinity. The Hgand binding domain for somatostatin is made up of residues in TMs III- VII with a potential contribution by the second extracellular loop. Somatostatin receptors are widely expressed in many tissues, frequently as multiple subtypes that coexist in the same cell.\n\n\nThe five different somatostatin receptors all functionally couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase by a pertussin-toxin sensitive protein (Gαil-3). (Lahlou et al, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.\n\n\n1014:121-131, 2004.) Somatostatin-induced inhibition of peptide secretion results mainly from a decrease in intracellular Ca^\n+\n.\n\n\nAmong the wide spectrum of somatostatin effects, several biological responses have been identified with different receptor subtypes selectivity. These include growth hormone (GH) secretion mediated by SSTR2 and SSTR5, insulin secretion mediated by SSTRl and SSTR5, glucagon secretion mediated by SSTR2, and immune responses mediated by SSTR2. (Patel et al, Neuroendocrinal. 20:157-198, 1999; Crider et al., Expert Opin, Ther. Patents 73:1427-1441, 2003.)\n\n\nDifferent somatostatin receptor sequences from different organisms are well known in the art. (See for example, Reisine et al, Endocrine Review 16 :427-442\n}\n 1995.) Human, rat, and murine SSTR3 sequences and encoding nucleic acid sequences are provided in SEQ ID NO: 3 (human SSTR3 cDNA gi|44890055|ref|NM J)OlOS 1.2| CDS 526..1782); SEQ ID NO: 4 (human SSTR3 AA gi|4557861 MlNPJ)01042. Ij); SEQ ID NO: 5 (mouse SSTR3 cDNA gi|6678040 ref|NM_009218.1| CDS 1..1287); SEQ ID NO: 6 (mouse SSTR3 AA gi|6678041 ref|NP_033244.1|); SEQ ID NO: 7 (rat SSTR3 cDNA gi|19424167|reflNMJ33522.1|\n\n\nCDS 656..1942); SEQ ID NO: 8 (rat SSTR3 A giil9424168jret]NP_598206.1|). SSTR3 antagonists can be identified using SSTR3 and nucleic acid encoding for SSTR3.\n\n\nSuitable assays include detecting compounds competing with a SSTR3 agonist for binding to SSTR3 and determining the functional effect of compounds on a SSTR3 cellular or physiologically relevant activity. SSTR3 cellular activities include cAMP inhibition, phospholipase C increase, tyrosine phsophatases increase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) decrease, K\n+\n channel increase, Na\n+\n/H\n+\n exchange decrease, and ERK decrease. (Lahlou et al, Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 1014:121 -131, 2004.) Functional activity can be determined using cell lines expressing SSTR3 and determining the effect of a compound on one or more SSTR3 activities (e.g., Poitout et al, J. Med. Chem. ¥4:29900-3000, 2001; Hocart et al, J. Med. Chem. 41:1146-1154, 1998). SSTR3 binding assays can be performed by labeling somatostatin and determining the ability of a compound to inhibit somatostatin binding. (Poitout et al, J. Med. Chem. 44:29900- \n\n 3000, 2001 ; Hocart et al, J. Med Chem. 4h\\ 146-1154, 1998.) Additional formats for measuring binding of a compound to a receptor are well-known in the art.\n\n\nA physiologically relevant activity for SSTR3 inhibition is stimulating insulin secretion. Stimulation of insulin secretion can be evaluated in vitro or in vivo. SSTR3 antagonists can be identified experimentally or based on available information. A variety of different SSTR3 antagonists are well known in the art. Examples of such antagonists include peptide antagonists, β-carboline derivatives, and a decahydroisoquinoline derivative. (Poitout et al, J Med. Chem. 44:29900-3000, 2001, Hocart et al, J. Med Chem. 47:1146-1154, 1998, Reubi et al, PNAS 97:13973-13978, 2000, Banziger et al, Tetrahedron: Assymetry /4\n:\n3469-3477, 2003, Crider et al, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 75:1427-1441, 2003, Troxler et al, international Publication No. WO 02/081471, International Publication Date October 17, 2002).\n\n\nAntagonists can be characterized based on their ability to bind to SSTR3 (Ki) and effect SSTR3 activity (IC50), and to selectively bind to SSTR3 and selectively affect SSTR3 activity. Preferred antagonists strongly and selectively bind to SSTR3 and inhibit SSTR3 activity.\n\n\nIn different embodiments concerning SSTR3 binding, the antagonist has a Ki (nM) less than 100, preferably less than 50, more preferably less than 25 or more preferably less than 10. Ki can be measured as described by Poitout et al, J. Med. Chem. 44:29900-3000, 2001 and described herein. A selective SSTR3 antagonist binds SSTR3 at least 10 times stronger than it binds\n\n\nSSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5. In different embodiments concerning selective SSTR3 binding, the antagonist binds to each of SSTRl\n5\n SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5 with a Ki greater than 1000, or preferably greater than 2000 nM and/or binds SSTR3 at least 40 times, more preferably at least 100 times, or more preferably at least 500 times, greater than it binds to SSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5.\n\n\nIn different embodiments concerning SSTR3 activity, the antagonist has an IC50 (nM) less than 500, preferably less than 100, more preferably less than 50, or more preferably less than 10 nM. IC 50 can be determined by measuring inhibition of somatostatin- 14 induced reduction of cAMP accumulation due to forskolin (1 μM) in CHO-Kl cells expressing SSTR3, as described by Poitout et al, J Med. Chem. 44:29900-3000, 2001.\n\n\nPreferred antagonists have a preferred or more preferred Ki, a preferred or more preferred IC50, and a preferred or more preferred selectivity. More preferred antagonists have a Ki (nM) less than 25; are at least 100 times selective for SSTR3 compared to SSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4 and SSTR5; and have a IC50 (nM) less than 50. US Patent No. 6,586,445 discloses β-carboline derivatives as somatostatin receptor antagonists and sodium channel blockers denoted as being useful for the treatment of numerous diseases. \n\n US Patent No. 6,861,430 also discloses β-carboline derivatives as SSTR3 antagonists for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders.\n\n\nAnother set of examples are imidazolyl tetrahydro- β-carboline derivatives based on the compounds provided in Poitout et at, J, Med.

The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural formula I. Compounds of structural formula I may be separated into their individual diastereoisomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof, or via chiral chromatography using an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.\n\n\nAlternatively, any stereoisomer of a compound of the general structural formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.\n\n\nIf desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography, such as chiral chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.\n\n\nSome of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\nSome of the compounds described herein may exist as taulomers which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention. Examples of tautomers which are intended to be encompassed within the compounds of the present invention are illustrated below: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSalts:\n\n\nIt will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of structural formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally. The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\nWhen treating or controlling diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 1 milligram to about 500 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 mg. In some cases, the daily dose may be as high as one gm. The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response. Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets or capsules. Examples of doses in tablets and capsules are 0.1 mg\n5\n 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg\ns\n 25 mg, 50 \n\n nag, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 rag, 400 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg. Other oral forms may also have the same or similar dosages.\n\n\nCompositions: Another aspect of the present invention provides compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered.\n\n\nThe compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nIn practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions as oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalHne cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective \n\n dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.\n\n\nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.\n\n\nIn some instances, depending on the solubility of the compound or salt being administered, it may be advantageous to formulate the compound or salt as a solution in an oil such as a triglyceride of one or more medium chain fatty acids, a lipophilic solvent such as triacetin, a hydrophilic solvent (e.g. propylene glycol), or a mixture of two or more of these, also optionally including one or more ionic or nonionic surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate 80, polyethoxylated triglycerides, and mono and/or diglycerides of one or more medium chain fatty acids. Solutions containing surfactants (especially 2 or more surfactants) will form emulsions or microemulsions on contact with water. The compound may also be formulated in a water soluble polymer in which it has been dispersed as an amorphous phase by such methods as hot melt extrusion and spray drying, such polymers including hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose acetate (HPMCAS), hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose (HPMCS), and polyvinylpyrrolidinones, including the homopolymer and copolymers. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\nCompounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant or mixture of surfactants such as hydroxypropylcellulose, polysorbate 80, and mono and diglycerides of medium and long chain fatty acids. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. \n\n Combination Therapy:\n\n\nCompounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drags that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. In the treatment of patients who have Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome \nj\n and co-morbidities that accompany these diseases, more than one drug is commonly administered. The compounds of this invention may generally be administered to a patient who is already taking one or more other drugs for these conditions. Often the compounds will be administered to a patient who is already being treated with one or more antidiabetic compound, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or PPAR agonists, when the patient's glycemic levels are not adequately responding to treatment.\n\n\nWhen a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nExamples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n(a) PPAR gamma agonists and partial agonists, including both glitazones and non- glitazones (e.g. troglitazone, pioglitazone, englitazone, MCC-555, rosiglitazone, balaglitazone, netoglitazone, T-131, LY-300512, LY-818, and compounds disclosed in WO02/08188, WO2004/020408, and WO2004/020409.

Non-limiting examples include combinations of compounds having Formula I with two or more active compounds selected from biguanides, sulfonylureas, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, other PPAR agonists, PTP-IB inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CBl) inverse agonists/antagonists.\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL ASSAYS Somatostatin Subtype Receptor 3 Production\n\n\nSSTR3 can be produced using techniques well known in the art including those involving chemical synthesis and those involving recombinant production. (See e g., Vincent, Peptide and \n\n Protein Drug Delivery, New York, N.Y., Decker, 1990; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley, 1987-2002, and Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2\nnd\n Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.)\n\n\nRecombinant nucleic acid techniques for producing a protein involve introducing, or producing, a recombinant gene encoding the protein in a cell and expressing the protein. A purified protein can be obtained from cell. Alternatively, the activity of the protein in a cell or cell extract can be evaluated.\n\n\nA recombinant gene contains nucleic acid encoding a protein along with regulatory elements for protein expression. The recombinant gene can be present in a cellular genome or can be part of an expression vector.\n\n\nThe regulatory elements that may be present as part of a recombinant gene include those naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence and exogenous regulatory elements not naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence. Exogenous regulatory elements such as an exogenous promoter can be useful for expressing a recombinant gene in a particular host or increasing the level of expression. Generally, the regulatory elements that are present in a recombinant gene include a transcriptional promoter, a πbosome binding site, a terminator, and an optionally present operator. A preferred element for processing in eukaryotic cells is a polyadenylation signal.\n\n\nExpression of a recombinant gene in a cell is facilitated through the use of an expression vector. Preferably, an expression vector in addition to a recombinant gene also contains art origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell, a selectable marker, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, and a potential for high copy number. Examples of expression vectors are cloning vectors, modified cloning vectors, specifically designed plasmids and viruses.\n\n\nIf desired, expression in a particular host can be enhanced through codon optimization. Codon optimization includes use of more preferred codons. Techniques for codon optimization in different hosts are well known in the art.\n\n\nEnhancement of Glucose Dependent Insulin Secretion (GDIS) by SSTR3 antagonists in Isolated Mouse Islet Cells: Pancreatic islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreas of normal C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Maine) by collagenase digestion and discontinuous Ficoll gradient separation, a modification of the original method of Lacy and Kostianovsky (Lacy et al, Diabetes /6:35-39, 1967). The islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (11 raM glucose) before GDIS assay. To measure GDIS, islets were first preincubated for 30 minutes in the Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer with 2 mM glucose (in petri dishes). The KRB medium contains 143.5 mMNa\n+\n, 5.8 mM K\n+\n, 2.5 mM Ca\n2+\n, 1.2 mM Mg\n2+\n, 124.1 mM Cl\n\"\n, 1.2 mM PO\n4\n \n3\"\n, 1.2 mM \n\n SO\n4\n \n2+\n, 25 mM CO\n3\n \n2\"\n, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The islets were then transferred to a 96-well plate (one islet/well) and incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 60 minutes in 200 μl of KRB buffer with 2 or 16 mM glucose, and other agents to be tested such as octreotide and a SST3 antagonist. (Zhou etal, J. Biol. Chem. 275:51316-51323, 2003.) Insulin was measured in aliquots of the incubation buffer by ELISA with a commercial kit (ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, NH).\n\n\nSSTR Binding Assays:\n\n\nThe receptor-ligand binding assays of all 5 subtype of SSTRs were performed with membranes isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-Kl cells stably expressing the cloned human somatostatin receptors in 96-well format as previous reported. (Yang et al. PNAS\n\n\n£5:10836-10841, 1998, Birzin et al. Anal. Biochem.307ύ59A66, 2002.)\n\n\nThe stable cell lines for SSTR1-SSTR5 were developed by stably transfecting with DNA for all five SSTRs using Lipofectamine. Neomycin-resistant clones were selected and maintained in medium containing 400 μg/mL G418 (Rohrer et al Science 282:731-740, 1998). Binding assays were performed using (3-\n125\nI~Tyrl I)-SRIF- 14 as the radioligand (used at 0.1 nM) and The\n\n\nPackard Unifilter assay plate. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.8) with 1 mM\n\n\nEGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, leupeptin (10 μg/mL), pepstatin (10 μg/mL), bacitracin (200 μg/mL), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/mL). CHO-Kl cell membranes, radiolabeled somatostatin, and unlabeled test compounds were resuspended or diluted in this assay buffer. Unlabeled test compounds were examined over a range of concentrations from 0.01 nM to 10,000 nM. The Kj values for compounds were determined as described by Cheng and Prusoff Biochem Pharmacol. 22:3099- 3108 (1973).\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention, particularly the compounds of Examples 1-19 and the Examples listed in Tables 2 and 3, exhibited Kj values in the range of 100 nM to 0.1 nM against SSTR3 and exhibited Ki values greater than 100 nM against SSTRl , SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5 receptors.\n\n\nFunctional Assay to Assess the Inhibition of SSTR3 Mediated Cyclic AMP Production:\n\n\nThe effects of compounds that bind to human and murine SSTR3 with various affinities on the functional activity of the receptor were assessed by measuring cAMP production in the presence of Forskolin (FSK) along or FSK plus SS-14 in SSTR3 expressing CHO cells. FSK acts to induce cAMP production in these cells by activating adenylate cyclases, whereas SS-14 suppresses cAMP production in the SSTR3 stable cells by binding to SSTR3 and the subsequent inhibition of adenylate cyclases via an alpha subunit of GTP-binding protein (God). To measure the agonism activity of the compounds, we pre-incubated the human or mouse SSTR3 stable CHO cells with the compounds for 15 min, followed by a one-hour incubation of the cells with 3.5 μM FSK (in the continuous presence of the compounds). The \n\n amount of cAMP produced during the incubation was quantified with the Lance cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Majority of the compounds described in this application show no or little agonism activity. Therefore we used %Activation to reflect the agonism activity of each compound. The %Activation which was calculated with the following formula:\n\n\n%Activation - [(FSK - Unknown) / (FSK - SS- 14] x 100\n\n\nTo measure the antagonism activity of the compounds, we pre-incubated the human or mouse SSTR3 stable CHO cells with the compounds for 15 min, followed by a one- hour incubation of the cells with a mixture of 3.5 μM FSK + 100 nM S S- 14 (in the continuous presence of the compounds). The amount of c AMP produced during the incubation was also quantified with the Lance cAMP assay. The antagonism activity of each compound was reflected both by %Inhibition (its maximum ability to block the action of SS- 14) and an IC50 value obtained by a eight-point titration. The % Inhibition of each compound was calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n% Inhibition = [1 - (unknown cAMP /FSK+SS-14 cAMP)] x 100 In some case, 20% of human serum was included in the incubation buffer during the antagonism mode of the function assay to estimate the serum shift of the potency.\n\n\nGlucose Tolerance Test in Mice:\n\n\nMale C57BL/6N mice (7-12 weeks of age) are housed 10 per cage and given access to normal diet rodent chow and water ad libitum. Mice are randomly assigned to treatment groups and fasted 4 to 6 h. Baseline blood glucose concentrations are determined by glucometer from tail nick blood. Animals are then treated orally with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose) or test compound. Blood glucose concentration is measured at a set time point after treatment (1 = 0 min) and mice are then challenged with dextrose intraperitoneally- (2-3 g/kg) or orally (3-5 g/kg). One group of vehicle-treated mice is challenged with saline as a negative control. Blood glucose levels are determined from tail bleeds taken at 20, 40, 60 minutes after dextrose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profile from t = 0 to t = 60 min is used to integrate an area under the curve (AUC) for each treatment. Percent inhibition values for each treatment are generated from the AUC data normalized to the saline-challenged controls. A similar assay may be performed in rats. Compounds of the present invention are active after an oral dose in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg. \n\n Abbreviations used in the following Schemes and Examples: aq. is aqueous; API-ES is atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray (mass spectrum term); AcCN is acetonitrile; Boc is tøt-butoxy carbonyl; d is day(s); DCM is dichloromethane; DEAD is diethyl azodicarboxylate; DIBAL is diisobutylaluminum hydride; DIPEA is ΛζN-diisopropylethylamine (Hunig's base); DMAP is 4-dimethylarnϊnopyridine; DMF is ΛW-dimethylformamide; DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide; EDC is l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride; EPA is ethylene polyacrylamide (a plastic); EtOAc is ethyl acetate; g is gram; h is hour(s); Hex is hexane; HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; HPLC is high pressure liquid chromatography; HPLC/MS is high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrum; in vacuo means rotary evaporation under diminished pressure; IPA is isopropyl alcohol; IPAC or IPAc is isopropyl acetate; KHMDS is potassium hexamethyldisilazide; LC is liquid chromatography; LC-MS is liquid chromatography-mass spectrum; LDA is lithium diisopropylamide; M is molar; Me is methyl; MeOH is methanol; MHz is megahertz; mg is milligram; min is minute(s); mL is milliliter; mmol is millimole; MPLC is medium-pressure liquid chromatography; MS or ms is mass spectrum; MTBE is methyl tert-bnty\\ ether; N is normal; NaHMDS is sodium hexamethyldisilazide; nm is nanometer; NMR is nuclear magnetic resonance; NMM is N- methylmorpholine; PyBOP is (benzotrϊazol-l-yloxy)triρyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate; R^ is retention time; rt or RT is room temperature; sat. is saturated; TEA is triethylamine; TFA is trifluoroacetic acid; TFAA is trifluoroacetic acid anhydride; THF is tetrahydrofuran; and TLC or tic is thin layer chromatography.\n\n\nSeveral methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples.
