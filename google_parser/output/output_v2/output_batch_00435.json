Specifically, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders, hematological disorders, eating disorders, obesity, anxiety, depression, diseases associated with pain, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n2A \n& 5-HT\n2C\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nsubtypes.\n\n\nThe 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D. R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.\n\n\nIn situ hybridization studies of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2 \nand CA\n3 \nregions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\nThe high affinity of number of antipsychotic agents towards 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, the localization of its mRNA in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with the said receptor (Ref: Sleight, A. J. et al. (1997) 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nreceptors: molecular biology, functional correlates and possible therapeutic indications, Drug News Perspect. 10, 214-224). Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see Reavill C. and Rogers D. C., Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.\n\n\nMonsma F. J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behavior yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [Stean, T. et al. (1999) Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. Br. J. Pharmacol. 127, 131P; Routledge, C. et al. (2000) Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6\n) receptor antagonist. Br. J. Pharmacol. 130, 1606-1612]. Although this indicates that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n\nOur understanding of the roles of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications such as anxiety; although one 5-HT\n6 \nagonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently, the exact role of the receptor is still to be established and is the focus of significant investigation. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.\n\n\nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M. P.; Lefevre, K.; Miguel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E I Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).\n\n\nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6 \nselective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist has some positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680).\n\n\nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6 \nligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\nAt present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [Cole, D. C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (August 28-September 1, Washington D.C.), Abstract MEDI 17.]\n\n\nInternational Patent Publication WO 03/066056 A1 reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication WO 03/065046 A2 discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and proposes that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334).\n\n\nFurther, recent in-vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P; and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612).\n\n\nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse.\n\n\nSuch compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, Roth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, pages 1403-1412; Sibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327, Sleight, A. J.; et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5; and Sleight, A. J.; et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-118.\n\n\nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist and 5-HT\n6 \nantisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542); Wooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129; and WO 02/098878.\n\n\nRecently a review by Holenz, Jo''rg et. al., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, April 2006, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT\n6 \nligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and to investigate its distribution.\n\n\nSo far several clinical candidates form the part of indole-type structures and are closely related structurally to the endogenous ligand 5-HT, for example compounds by Glennon, R.

SB-271046, the first 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist to enter Phase I clinical development, has been discontinued (probably because of low penetration of the blood-brain barrier). In addition, the selective 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist SB-271046 is inactive in animal tests related to either positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia [Pouzet, B. et al. (2002) Effects of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist, SB-271046, in animal models for schizophrenia. Pharmacol. Biochem.

disorganized or catatonic behavior. See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, the mammal being treated therewith.\n\n\n“Therapeutically effective amount” is defined as ‘an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein’.\n\n\nThe terms “treating”, “treat” or “treatment” embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.\n\n\nThe term “stereoisomers” is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n\n\nCertain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e.g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nThe stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L-mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.\n\n\nThe stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:\n\n \n \ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form.\n \nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (Principles of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316).\n \niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (Jacques et. al., “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution”, Wiley Interscience, 1981).\n \niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases.\n \n\n\nChiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers.\n\n\nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. The present invention includes, within its scope, all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts forming a part of this invention may be prepared by treating the compound of formula (I) with 1-6 equivalents of a base such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium t-butoxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate, calcium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride and the like. Solvents such as water, acetone, ether, THF, methanol, ethanol, t-butanol, dioxane, isopropanol, isopropyl ether or mixtures thereof may be used.\n\n\nIn addition to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, other salts are included in the invention. They may serve as intermediates in the purification of the compounds, in the preparation of other salts or in the identification and characterization of the compounds or intermediates.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be solvated, eg. as the hydrate. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric solvates (example: hydrates) as well as compounds containing variable amounts of solvent (example: water).\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises of the following route, wherein the key intermediate is synthesized as described in preparation 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nScheme-I\n\n\n\nThe process of this invention includes contacting a compound of the following formula (a),\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith amine derivatives, in presence of inert solvent at ambient temperature to obtain a compound of formula (I), wherein all substitutions are described as earlier.\n\n\n\nThe above reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, ethyl acetate, water, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl ether (DME), alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propranol, n-butanol, tert-butanol and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m-, p-xylene and the like or a mixture thereof and preferably using DMF and m-xylene. The inert atmosphere may be maintained by using inert gases such as N\n2\n, Ar or He. The reaction may be affected in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydride and alkali metal hydroxides and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide or mixtures thereof. The reaction can also be conducted in the absence of a base. The reaction temperature may range from 30° C. to 160 based on the choice of solvent and preferably at a temperature in the range from 30° C. to 100° C. The duration of the reaction may range from 1 to 24 hours, preferably from a period of 8 to 14 hours.\n\n\nCompounds obtained by the above method of preparation of the present invention can be transformed into another compound of this invention by further chemical modifications using well-known reactions such as oxidation, reduction, protection, deprotection, rearrangement reaction, halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation, alkylthiolation, demethylation, O-alkylation, O-acylation, N-alkylation, N-alkenylation, N-acylation, N-cyanation, N-sulfonylation, coupling reaction using transition metals and the like.\n\n\nIf necessary, any one or more than one of the following steps can be carried out,\n\n \n \n \n \ni) Converting a compound of the formula (I) into another compound of the formula (I)\n \nii) Removing any protecting groups or\n \niii) Forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or a prodrug thereof.\n \n \n \n\n\nProcess (i) may be performed using conventional interconversion procedures such as epimerisation, oxidation, reduction, alkylation, nucleophilic or electrophilic aromatic substitution and ester hydrolysis or amide bond formation.\n\n\nIn process (ii) examples of protecting groups and the means for their removal can be found in T. W. Greene ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ (J. Wiley and Sons, 1991). Suitable amine protecting groups include sulphonyl (e.g. tosyl), acyl (e.g. acetyl, 2′,2′,2′-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl) and arylalkyl (eg. benzyl), which may be removed by hydrolysis (e.g. using an acid such as hydrochloric or trifluoroacetic acid) or reductively (e.g. hydrogenolysis of a benzyl group or reductive removal of a 2′,2′,2′-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group using zinc in acetic acid) as appropriate. Other suitable amine protecting groups include trifluoroacetyl, which may be removed by base catalysed hydrolysis or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group (Ellman linker), which may be removed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis, for example with trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\nIn process (iii) halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared conventionally by reaction with the appropriate acid or acid derivative as described earlier in detail.\n\n\nIn order to use the compounds of formula (I) in therapy, they will normally be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.\n\n\nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate) or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol) and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).\n\n\nFor buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.\n\n\nThe active compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.\n\n\nThe active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.\n\n\nFor intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer or from a capsule using a inhaler or insufflator. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule; it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\nAerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g., migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or “puff” of aerosol contains 20 μg to 1000 μg of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 μg to 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1, 2 or 3 doses each time.\n\n\nAn effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) or their derivatives as defined above can be used to produce a medicament, along with conventional pharmaceutical auxiliaries, carriers and additives.\n\n\nSuch therapy includes multiple choices: for example, administering two compatible compounds simultaneously in a single dose form or administering each compound individually in a separate dosage or if required at same time interval or separately in order to maximize the beneficial effect or minimize the potential side-effects of the drugs according to the known principles of pharmacology.\n\n\nThe dose of the active compounds can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration, age and weight of patient, nature and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. Therefore, any reference herein to a pharmacologically effective amount of the compounds of general formula (I) refers to the aforementioned factors. A proposed dose of the active compounds of this invention, for either oral, parenteral, nasal or buccal administration, to an average adult human, for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is 0.1 to 200 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.\n\n\nCommercial reagents were utilized without further purification. Room temperature refers to 25-30° C. IR were taken using KBr and in solid state. Unless otherwise stated, all mass spectra were carried out using ESI conditions. \n1\nH-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz on a Bruker instrument. Deuterated chloroform (99.8% D) was used as solvent. TMS was used as internal reference standard. Chemical shift values are expressed in parts per million (δ) values. The following abbreviations are used for the multiplicity for the NMR signals: s=singlet, bs=broad singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, qui=quintet, h=heptet, dd=double doublet, dt=double triplet, tt=triplet of triplets, m=multiplet. Chromatography refers to column chromatography performed using 100-200 mesh silica gel and executed under nitrogen pressure (flash chromatography) conditions.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe novel compounds of the present invention were prepared according to the following procedures, using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the following specific examples. The most preferred compounds of the invention are any or all of those specifically set forth in these examples. These compounds are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention, and any combination of the compounds or their moieties may itself form a genus. The following examples further illustrate details for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and process of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compounds.\n\n\nPreparation 1: 1-(3-Acetamido-4-methoxy benzenesulfonyl)-5-methoxy-3-methyl-1H-indole\n\n\nSodium hydride (2.15 grams, 49.3 mmol) was taken into a 250 mL three-necked round bottom flask containing tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. Added a solution of 5-methoxy-3-methyl indole solution (5.3 grams, 32.9 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) to the above mixture at 25° C., over a period of 15 minutes. The above reaction mass was stirred further for a period of 1 hour and mass was cooled to 0° C. and a solution of 3-acetamido-4-methoxy benzenesulfonyl chloride (13.01 grams, 49.3 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (65 mL) was added through a dropping funnel over a period of 20 minutes. This mass was allowed to cool to room temperature and stirred over night (˜24 hours). The progress of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography. After completion of the reaction it was quenched into ice water (100 mL) under stirring and extracted the product with ethylacetate (2×250 mL). Organic phase was washed with brine solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain thick syrupy mass, which was used as such for the next step without purification.\n\n\nMass (m/z): 389.4 (M+H)\n+\n;\n\n\nPreparation 2: 1-(3-Amino-4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-5-methoxy-3-methyl-1H-indole\n\n\n1-(3′-Acetamido-4′-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-5-methoxy-3-methyl-1H-indole (10 grams, 25.7 mmol) (obtained from preparation 1) was taken into a 250 mL of three necked round bottom flask containing ethanol (100 mL) and stirred the mass to obtain a clear solution. Aqueous hydrochloric acid (10 mL, 33%) was added to this clear solution and heated the mass at reflux temperature for a period of two hours. The progress of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mass was concentrated under vacuum and the residual mass was quenched into chilled water (100 mL). The pH was adjusted to 9.0 to 10.0 with dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The product was extracted with dichloro methane (2×100 mL). Organic phase was washed with brine solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated the mass under reduced pressure to obtain crude compound.

J. Jr., et al., Molecular Cloning and Expression of Novel Serotonin Receptor with High Affinity for Tricyclic Psychotropic Drugs. Mol. Pharmacol. (43): 320-327 (1993).\n\n\nExample 50\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nFunctional Assay Cyclic AMP\n\n\nThe antagonist property of the compounds at the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors was determined by testing their effect on cAMP accumulation in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\nHuman 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 μg/mL G418 and incubated at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70% confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and 1 μM serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 μM EDTA (2:1) at 4° C. for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4° C. and the supernatants were stored at 4° C. until assayed.\n\n\ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 μL, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 mL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hours at 4° C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4° C., the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.\n\n\nIn the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n7\n.\n\n\nExample 51\n\n\nRodent Pharmacokinetic Study\n\n\nMale wistar rats (230-280 grams) obtained from NIN (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\nThree to five animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept fasted over night and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Three rats were dosed NCE (10 mg/Kg) orally and intravenously on day 0 and day 2.\n\n\nAt each time point blood was collected by jugular vein. Plasma was stored frozen at −20° C. until analysis. The concentrations of the NCE compound in plasma were determined using LC-MS/MS method.\n\n\nSchedule time points: Pre dose 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours after dosing (n=3). The NCE compounds were quantified in plasma by validated LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction technique. NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 2-2000 ng/ml in plasma.

Animals were given water and food ad libitum throughout the experiment, and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle.\n\n\nBrain penetration was determined at steady state in rat. One day prior to dosing day, male wistar rats (225-250 grams) were anesthetized with halothane for surgical placement of jugular and femoral vein catheters. After surgery, the rats were housed in individual rat infusion cage connected with infusion components (Instech Solomon; Plymouth Meeting, Pa. USA) and allowed free access to food and water\n\n\nNCE compound was dissolved in water, and administered at a constant infusion rate (5 ml/kg/hr) over 6-10 hours at a target dose rate of 1.0 mg free base/kg/h. Blood samples were removed during the latter part of the infusion to confirm steady-state blood concentrations, brain and blood was collected and estimated. Animals will be sacrificed to collect the plasma and brain tissue and was homogenized. Plasma and Brain was stored frozen at −20° C. until analysis. The concentrations of the NCE compound in plasma and Brain were determined using LC-MS/MS method.\n\n\nThe NCE compounds were quantified in plasma and brain homogenate by validated LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction technique. NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 1-500 ng/mL in plasma and brain homogenate. Study samples were analyzed using calibration samples in the batch and quality control samples spread across the batch. Extents of brain-blood ratio were calculated (Cb/Cp).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRoute of\n\n\nSteady State\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\nadminis-\n\n\nBrain Pene-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nStrain/Gender\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\ntration\n\n\ntration C\nb\n/C\np\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nWister/Male\n\n\n10\n\n\nWater\n\n\nOral\n\n\n20.16 ± 1.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\nWister/Male\n\n\n10\n\n\nWater\n\n\nOral\n\n\n13.50 ± 4.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31.\n\n\nWister/Male\n\n\n10\n\n\nWater\n\n\nOral\n\n\n 3.48 ± 0.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 53\n\n\nRodent Brain Micro Dialysis Study for Possible Modulation of Neurotransmitters\n\n\nMale Wister rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N.I.N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals.\n\n\nGroup allocation Group 1: Vehicle (Water; 5 mL/kg; p.o.), Group 2: NCE (3 mg/kg; p.o.), Group 3: NCE (10 mg/kg; p.o.)\n\n\nSurgical Procedure: Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and placed in Stereotaxic frame. Guide cannula (CMA/12) was placed at AP: −5.2 mm, ML: +5.0 mm relative from bregma and DV: −3.8 mm from the brain surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1986). While the animal was still anesthetized, a micro dialysis probe (CMA/12, 4 mm, PC) was inserted through the guide cannula and secured in place. After surgery recovery period of 48-72 hours was maintained before subjecting the animal for study.\n\n\nA day prior to study animals were transferred to home cages for acclimatization and implanted probe was perfused overnight with a modified Ringer's solution comprised of 1.3 μM CaCl2 (Sigma), 1.0 μM MgCl\n2 \n(Sigma), 3.0 μM KCl (Sigma), 147.0 μM NaCl (Sigma), 1.0 μM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 0.2 μM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.2H\n2\nO and 0.3 μM neostigmine bromide (Sigma) (pH to 7.2) at a rate of 0.2 μL/minute set by a microinfusion pump (PicoPlus, Harward). On the day of experiment perfusion rate was changed to 1.2 μL/minutes and allowed for 3 hours stabilization. After stabilization period, four basals, were collected at 20 minutes intervals before dosing. Dialysate samples were collected in glass vials using CMA/1.70 refrigerated fraction collector.\n\n\nVehicle or NCE (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered by gavage after four fractions had been collected. The perfusate was collected until 6 hours after administration.\n\n\nAcetylcholine concentrations in dialysate samples were measured by LC-MS/MS (API 4000, MDS SCIEX) method. Acetylcholine is quantified in the calibration range of 0.250 to 8.004 ng/mL in dialysates.\n\n\nOn completion of the microdialysis experiments, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were removed and stored in a 10% formalin solution. Each brain was sliced at 50μ on a cryostat (Leica) stained and examined microscopically to confirm probe placement. Data from animals with incorrect probe placement were discarded.\n\n\nMicrodialysis data were expressed as percent changes (Mean±S.E.M.) of baseline that was defined as the average absolute value (in fM/10 μL) of the four samples before drug administration.\n\n\nEffects of NCE (3 & 10 mg/kg) and Vehicle treatments were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. In all statistical measures, a p<0.05 was considered significant. The Graph Pad Prism program statistically evaluated the data.\n\n\nExample 54\n\n\nFood Intake Measurement\n\n\nMale Wister rats (120-140 grams) obtained from N.I.N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used. The chronic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) on food intake in well-fed rats was then determined as follows.\n\n\nThe rats were housed in single home cages for 28 days. During this period, the rats were either dosed orally or ip, with a composition comprising a compound of formula (1) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without the said compound (control group), once a day. The rat is provided with ad libitum food and water.\n\n\nOn 0, 1\nst\n, 7\nth\n, 14\nth\n, 21\nst \nand 28\nth \nday the rats were left with the pre-weighed amounts of food. Food intake and weight gain were measured on a routine basis. Also a food ingestion method is disclosed in the literature (Kask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 414, 2001, 215-224 and Turnball et. al., Diabetes, vol 51, August, 2002, and some in-house modifications.). The respective parts of the descriptions are herein incorporated as a reference and they form part of the disclosure.\n\n\nSome representative compounds have shown the statistically significant decrease in food intake, when conducted in the above manner at the doses of either 10 mg/Kg or 30 mg/Kg or both\n\n\nExample 55\n\n\nObject Recognition Task Model\n\n\nThe cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of this invention were estimated using a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model. Male Wister rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N.I.N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects.\n\n\nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\nThe experiment was carried out in a 50×50×50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height×5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed. T1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1+a2). T2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3+b).\n\n\nThe object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats-Behavioral data, Behav. Brain Res., 31, 47-59.\n\n\nSome representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNORT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nDiscriminative Index (DI) = Treatment (Vehicle)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n10 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n30 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\nInference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\n0.46 (0.52)\n\n\n0.58 (0.56)\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31.\n\n\n0.54 (0.48)\n\n\n0.52 (0.52)\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 56\n\n\nWater Maze\n\n\nThe water maze apparatus consisted of a circular pool (1.8 m diameter, 0.6 m high) constructed in black Perspex (TSE systems, Germany) filled with water (24±2° C.) and positioned underneath a wide-angled video camera to track animal. The 10 cm\n2 \nperspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber\n\n\nScopolamine Induced Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.\n\n\n ≧3 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31.\n\n\n≧30 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 57\n\n\nChewing/Yawning/Stretching Induction by 5-HT\n6 \nR Antagonists\n\n\nMale Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.\n\n\nReference: (A) King M. V., Sleight A., J., Woolley M.

J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).\n\n\nExample 58\n\n\nPassive Avoidance\n\n\nAnimals were trained in a single-trial, step through, light-dark passive avoidance paradigm. The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\nExperimental Procedure:\n\n\nThis was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually <20 seconds) and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 seconds was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 seconds was employed.\n\n\nReference: (A) Callahan P.

No. 10/837,519, filed Apr. 30, 2004, now allowed, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/546,393, filed Feb. 19, 2004 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/467,442, filed May 1, 2003, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention (Technical Field)\n\n\nThe present invention relates to tetra- and penta-substituted piperazine and piperazine-derivative ring compounds, the ring compounds optionally including one C═O or C═S member, that bind to one or more melanocortin receptors and are optionally agonists, antagonists, mixed agonist-antagonists or inverse agonists with respect to one or more melanocortin receptors, and use thereof for the treatment of metabolic, immune, infection-related and melanocortin receptor-mediated disorders.\n\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\nNote that the following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.\n\n\nPiperazines are an important class of molecular templates that have been employed in the development of several drugs. However, in the prior art generally only mono- or di-substituted piperazine templates have been employed. In a few instances a tri-substituted piperazine has been employed, such as Indinavir (Merck), an HIV protease inhibitor drug that incorporates a tri-substituted piperazine.\n\n\nMelanocortin Receptor-Specific Agents. A family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including \nmelanocortin\n 1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, \nmelanocortin\n 2 receptors (MC2-R) for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, \nmelanocortin\n 3 and \nmelanocortin\n 4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R), expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and \nmelanocortin\n 5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of tissues.\n\n\nIn general, compounds specific for MC1-R are believed to be useful for treatment of melanoma. Compounds specific for MC3-R or MC4-R are believed to be useful in regulation of energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain, for use in treatment of anorexia and cachexia, for treatment of obesity, and treatment of other food intake and metabolism-related indications. Compounds specific for MC3-R and MC4-R, among other melanocortin receptors, can further be used as agents for treatment of sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction. Other clinical uses are being explored, such as use of MC4-R antagonists as anxiolytic or antidepressant drugs. Other melanocortin receptor-specific compounds, such as MCR-1 agonists, can be used as tanning agents to increase melanin production in the skin, acting as chemo-preventive agents against harmful effects of UV solar radiation. Compounds specific for MCR-1 and MCR-3 may further be useful in regulation of inflammatory processes. Compounds specific for MCR-5 may be used for treatment of acne and related skin disorders due to over stimulation of sebaceous gland. Compounds specific for MCR-4 and MCR-5 may be used for treatment of depression. Compounds specific for MCR-3 may find use as a therapeutic for treating salt-induced hypertension. In general, the melanocortin system is involved in diverse physiological functions, including energy balance, pigmentation, sexual function and inflammation.\n\n\nThe mechanism of action of compounds specific for MC3-R or MC4-R as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain has not been fully elucidated. While most reports suggest that MC4-R agonists may be employed for attenuating food intake and body weight gain, it is clear that agouti-related protein (AgRP), an endogenous inverse agonist, plays a critical role in the regulatory system. At least one group has suggested that a neutral antagonist of AgRP may produce agonist-like effects in vivo. (Adan, R. A. H. and Kas, M. J. H. Inverse agonist gains weight. \nTRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences \n24(6):315-321, 2003.) However, no such compounds have heretofore been described. Further, all or virtually all MC4-R agonists compounds reported for attenuating food intake or body weight gain in animal models have shown a “rebound” effect, with animals gaining weight equal to or, in most instances, exceeding controls on cessation of administration of the compounds. There is thus a need for compounds which attenuate food intake or body weight gain without causing a rebound effect on cessation of administration of the compound.\n\n\nThere is a significant need for compounds with high specificity for discrete melanocortin receptors, as well as for compounds that are agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, or otherwise bind to specific melanocortin receptors. High affinity compounds for melanocortin receptors can be used to exploit varied physiological responses associated with melanocortin receptors, as agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists or otherwise. In addition, melanocortin receptors have an effect on the activity of various cytokines, and high affinity compounds for melanocortin receptors can be used to regulate cytokine activity.\n\n\nPiperazine Compounds. There are piperazine and piperidine compounds known, such as those disclosed in WO 03/009850 (Amgen), WO 03/009847 (Amgen), WO 03/094918 (Neurocrine Biosciences), WO 03/1093234 (Procter & Gamble), WO 03/092690 (Procter & Gamble), WO 03/061660 (Eli Lilly and Company), WO 03/053927 (Taisho Pharm.), WO 03/031410 (Neurocrine Biosciences), WO 03/007949 (Merck & Co.), WO 02/092566 (Taisho Pharm.), WO 02/079146 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), WO 02/070511 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), WO 02/068388 (Merck & Co.), WO 02/068387 (Merck & Co.), WO 02/067869 (Merck & Co.), WO 02/059095 (Eli Lilly and Company), WO 02/00259 (Taisho Pharm.), and WO 00/74679 (Merck & Co.), asserted to be specific for melanocortin or related receptors. However, in general such compounds have at most two functional substituted groups, have relatively poor affinity and specificity, and are not suitable for use as a drug compound. There is a significant need for compounds with high specificity for discrete receptors, such as specific melanocortin receptors, as well as compounds that are agonists, inverse agonists, or antagonists for such receptors. High affinity compounds for such receptors can be used to exploit varied physiological responses associated with the receptors, either as agonists or antagonists. There is thus a need for compounds that are more selective, including higher affinity and specificity, and in particular for compounds that have at least four biologically active substituted groups. This invention addresses that need.\n\n\nWO 02/085925, “Melanocortin Receptor Ligands”, to The Proctor & Gamble Company, discloses ketopiperazine structures and methods of synthesis thereof, but does not disclose piperazine structures, piperazine structures with four substituted groups, methods to synthesize piperazine structures, methods to synthesize piperazine or ketopiperazine structures with four substituted groups, or methods to synthesize optically pure structures, and further does not disclose structures with a single substituent group that is a single D-Phe residue, or a derivative or homolog thereof, optionally with an amine capping group.\n\n\nWith respect to certain objects, methods, synthetic schemes, utilities, applications, definitions, protocols and other disclosures, this application is related to PCT/US02/25574, entitled Peptidomimetics of Biologically Active Molecules, filed on Aug. 12, 2002; to PCT/US01/50075, entitled Identification of Target-Specific Folding Sites in Peptides and Proteins, filed on Dec. 19, 2001; and to U.S. patent application Ser.

By employing four or five descriptors, the inventors have further found that the chirality of the ring, and stereo structure generally, is fixed in a desired structure, thereby more closely mimicking the desired pharmacophores, and with the descriptors positioned in the most relevant chemical space.\n\n\nThis invention thus discloses the use of tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related derivative templates for drug design. The invention further also relates to enantiomerically pure tetra-substituted piperazines, preferably made by the synthetic schemes disclosed herein or variants thereof. A classic piperazine ring is a conformationally dynamic six-membered ring structure. It can exist in a variety of conformational states, commonly referred to as chair, boat, twisted chair or twisted boat conformations. Because of this dynamism in structural states, the location of descriptors on the ring plays an important role in stabilizing the ring in a single conformational state; if the appropriate conformational state is selected, this is conducive to making a molecule more selective for its receptor in terms of binding affinity and intrinsic functional activity. For example, a 1,3 axial placement of two bulky descriptors generally causes unfavorable steric interactions between these two groups, and thus make a chair conformation energetically less stable. Consequently, the chair conformation is less preferred, resulting in a twisted chair or boat conformation. The twisted chair or boat conformation results in a specific stereochemical alignment of the descriptors, which is specifically relevant to interaction with the desired receptor. Thus a conformation resulting from 1,3 axial placement of two descriptors may result in a structure more selective for a given receptor sub-type.\n\n\nIn one broad aspect, the invention describes and discloses the use of tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds as biologically active agents. In a related aspect, the invention describes and discloses the use of tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds as mimetics of desired pharmacophores, including but not limited to pharmacophores derived from biologically active metallopeptides, which biologically active metallopeptides may in turn be derived from biologically active peptides, polypeptides or proteins.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the invention describes tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds specific for G-protein coupled receptor systems, such systems including, but not limited to, melanotropin or melanocortin receptors (MC1-R, MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R).\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the invention provides novel schemes and methods of synthesis of tetra-substituted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds.\n\n\nDefinitions. Before proceeding further with the description of the invention, certain terms are defined as set forth herein.\n\n\nThe “amino acid” and “amino acids” used in this invention, and the terms as used in the specification and claims, include the known naturally occurring protein amino acids, which are referred to by both their common three letter abbreviation and single letter abbreviation. See generally \nSynthetic Peptides: A User's Guide\n, G A Grant, editor, W.H. Freeman & Co., New York, 1992, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the text and table set forth at \npages\n 11 through 24. As set forth above, the term “amino acid” also includes stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. Modified and unusual amino acids are described generally in \nSynthetic Peptides: A User's Guide\n, cited above, Hruby V J, Al-obeidi F and Kazmierski W: \nBiochem J \n268:249-262, 1990; and Toniolo C: \nInt J Peptide Protein Res \n35:287-300, 1990; the teachings of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe term “amino acid side chain moiety” used in this invention includes any side chain of any amino acid, as the term “amino acid” is defined herein, including any derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety, as the term “derivative” is defined herein. Therefore, this includes the side chain moiety present in naturally occurring amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in modified naturally occurring amino acids, such as glycosylated amino acids.

The term is not limited to physiological conditions, and includes psychogenic conditions or perceived impairment without a formal diagnosis of pathology or disorder. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in a male mammal and female sexual dysfunction in a female mammal.\n\n\n“Erectile dysfunction” is a disorder involving the failure of a male mammal to achieve functional erection, ejaculation, or both. Erectile dysfunction is accordingly synonymous with impotence, and includes the inability to attain or sustain an erection of sufficient rigidity for coitus. Symptoms of erectile dysfunction include an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, ejaculatory failure, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve an orgasm. An increase in erectile dysfunction is often associated with age or may be caused by a physical disease or as a side-effect of drug treatment.\n\n\n“Female sexual dysfunction” is a disorder including sexual arousal disorder. The term “sexual arousal disorder” includes a persistent or recurrent failure to attain or maintain the lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement until completion of sexual activity. Sexual dysfunction in females can also include inhibited orgasm and dyspareunia, which is painful or difficult coitus. Female sexual dysfunction includes, but is not limited to, a number of categories of diseases, conditions and disorders including hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual anhedonia, sexual arousal disorder, dyspareunia and vaginismus. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder includes a disorder in which sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity are persistently or recurrently diminished or absent, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder can be related to boredom or unhappiness in a long-standing relationship, depression, dependence on alcohol or psychoactive drugs, side effects from prescription drugs, or hormonal deficiencies. Sexual anhedonia includes decreased or absent pleasure in sexual activity. Sexual anhedonia can be caused by depression, drugs, or interpersonal factors. Sexual arousal disorder can be caused by reduced estrogen, illness, or treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or antihypertensive agents. Dyspareunia and vaginismus are sexual pain disorders characterized by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused, for example, by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.\n\n\nBy a melanocortin receptor “agonist” is meant an endogenous or drug substance or compound, including a compound of this invention that can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase expression, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. By a melanocortin receptor “antagonist” is meant a drug or a compound, including a compound of this invention, that opposes the melanocortin receptor-associated responses normally induced by a melanocortin receptor agonist agent, but without itself initiating a pharmacological response characteristic of the melanocortin receptor, such as increasing or decreasing adenyl cyclase expression. By a melanocortin receptor “inverse agonist” is meant a drug or a compound, including a compound of this invention, that is an antagonist with respect to an agonist, and which by itself induces or initiates a pharmacological response characteristic of the melanocortin receptor, such as reducing basal or constitutive adenyl cyclase expression.\n\n\nBy “binding affinity” is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target.\n\n\nBy “intrinsic activity” is meant the maximal stimulation of adenyl cyclase achievable by a compound in a melanocortin receptor cell system. The maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (or 100%) and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity that of α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as having an intrinsic activity of 0.5 (or 50%). A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an intrinsic activity of 0.7 (70%) or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with intrinsic activity between 0.1 (10%) and 0.7 (70%) is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) is classified as inactive or having no intrinsic activity. Compounds with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) were further evaluated, as indicated herein, for antagonist effect.\n\n\nClinical Applications. The compounds disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the product is used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term “patient” is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of this invention involve human patients, but this invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals.\n\n\nMelanocortin receptor-specific compounds of this invention that are MC1-R specific can be used as chemoprevention agents against sun-induced, such as by UV radiation, neoplastic activity in human skin. MC1-R agonist compounds of this invention may be employed to stimulate epidermal melanocytes to produce melanin as well as to convert pheomelanin to eumelanin. Eumelanin, which is dark brown or black pigmentation, is considered more photo-protective than pheomelanin, which is yellow or red pigmentation. The process of melanogenesis is believed to involve stimulation of MC1-R in epidermal melanocytes, thereby mediating the stimulation of tyrosinase enzymes within these pigment cells, inducing the conversion of tyrosine to dopa and then through dopaquinone to eumelanin. Sun tanning due to direct sun exposure is proposed to result from the same pathway by local production of melanotropic peptide from a POMC gene in the epidermis. Thus stimulation of eumelanin production and conversion of pheomelanin to eumelanin may be a desirable chemoprevention modality in blocking sun- or UV-induced neoplastic activity in skin. A potent, high-affinity and highly selective MC1-R agonist peptidomimetic compound of this invention can accordingly be used as a therapeutic chemoprevention agent for combating harmful sun or UV exposure that induces neoplastic activity in skin melanocytes.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, compounds of this invention that are MC4-R agonists can be used as a therapeutic agent to modify energy metabolism and feeding behavior, including treatment of pathologic obesity and related conditions. Compounds of this invention that are MC4-R antagonists can be used as a therapeutic agent in eating disorders, such as treatment of anorexia and cachexia, which is malnutrition and wasting due to illness. Control centers for eating and satiety reside in the hypothalamus. These responses are determined by diverse hormones and soluble factors that signal through specific receptors in the hypothalamus. MC4-R is known to be expressed in the brain, and inactivation of this receptor by gene targeting has resulted in mice with a maturity-onset obesity syndrome associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia.\n\n\nThis invention include compounds that are MC4-R agonists or partial agonists with demonstrated efficacy, in animal models, in modifying energy metabolism and feeding behavior, and further includes compounds that are inactive or have no intrinsic activity with respect to MC4-R, but bind MC4-R with high affinity and, in some instances, selectivity, and further have demonstrated efficacy, in animal models, in modifying energy metabolism and feeding behavior. It is hypothesized, without desiring to be bound by theory, that at least some compounds of this invention that bind MC4-R with high affinity are neutral antagonists of the inverse agonist AgRP, but independently are inactive or have no intrinsic activity with respect to MC4-R, and that such compounds may be used as a therapeutic agent to modify energy metabolism and feeding behavior, including treatment of pathologic obesity and related conditions.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, compounds of this invention can be used as therapeutic agents for treatment of sexual dysfunction, including treatment of both male erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, compounds of this invention may be used as therapeutic agents for treatment of inflammation, including specifically MC1-R, MC3-R and MC5-R agonists.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, compounds of this invention that are MC5-R specific can be used as agents to decrease sebum production, and thus may be efficacious in the treatment of acne and related diseases. The compounds for this application may be conveniently formulated for local administration, as through a gel, lotion, cream or other topical formulation.\n\n\nThe compounds may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized forms and aerosols and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. The compounds may be administered by any systemic or partially systemic means known in the art, including but not limited to intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, administration through mucous membranes, oral administration, dermal administration, skin patches, aerosols and the like.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound of this invention may thus be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound of this invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride or sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is suitable, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or time-release formulations and additives may be employed, such that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a compound of this invention over a period of time.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared in a suitable solvent from the compound and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic acids. The acetate salt form is especially useful. Where the compounds of this invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts.\n\n\nThe compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by injection, which injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or by any other means known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the compounds of this invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration and the like. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\nTherapeutically Effective Amount. In general, the actual quantity of compound of this invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. This may readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art through means such as pharmacokinetic studies, plasma half-life studies, dose escalation studies, and the like. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of this invention that is sufficient to induce the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention are highly active. For example, the compound can be administered at 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 500 μg/kg body weight, depending on specific compound selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art. Conventional dose response studies and other pharmacological means may be employed to determine the optimal dose for a desired effect with a given compound, given formulation and given route of administration.\n\n\nCombination Therapy and Sexual Dysfunction. It is also possible and contemplated to use the compounds of this invention in combination with other drugs or agents for treatment of sexual dysfunction. These other drugs and agents may include melanocortin receptor-specific agents that induce erectile activity, including specifically MC3-R and MC4-R agonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, testosterone, prostaglandin and the like. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of the invention are used in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor or an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Similarly, the compounds of this invention may be used in combination with any known mechanical aids or devices.\n\n\nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to the patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. The compound of this invention may be administered simultaneously with, prior to or subsequent to administration with a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Preferably the compound of this invention is administered within one hour, preferably within less than one-half hour, of administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. However, for certain forms of combination therapy, such as for example in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on an independent schedule, such that there is no set or specific temporal relationship between administration of the compound of this invention and the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Thus, for example, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on a daily or other dose, or by means of patches or other continuous administration schedules, with administration of the compound of this invention when desired or needed by the patient.\n\n\nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to a patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention in combination with a compound that is a melanocortin receptor agonist.\n\n\nThe present invention further also provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to a patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention in combination with a compound that is a melanocortin receptor agonist and in combination with another compound that is useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is female sexual dysfunction. In an especially preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is erectile dysfunction. In a preferred embodiment of the foregoing methods, the melanocortin receptor agonist is an agonist of MC3-R or MC4-R, and preferably MC4-R. The agonist may be a non-selective MC3-R and MC4-R agonist.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise 1) a compound of this invention and 2) a compound that is a melanocortin receptor agonist. The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise 1) a compound of this invention; 2) a compound that is a melanocortin receptor agonist; and 3) a third compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise 1) a compound of this invention and 2) a second compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nRepresentative agonists of the melanocortin receptor which are a second compound useful in combination therapy are disclosed in the following publications, which are incorporated here by reference in their entirety: M.

The compounds of this invention may be used to treat female sexual dysfunction as well as male sexual dysfunction. In general, the dosing schedules and doses for females are comparable to those for males.\n\n\nCombination Therapy and Weight Regulation. It is also possible and contemplated to use compounds of this invention in combination with other drugs or agents for treatment of various weight and feeding-related disorders. Where the compound is an agonist or partial agonist, the compound may be employed for decreasing food intake and/or body weight in combination with any other agent or drug heretofore employed as a diet aid, or for decreasing food intake and/or body weight. Where the compound binds with high affinity and specificity to MC4-R but has no intrinsic activity at MC4-R, the compound may be employed for decreasing food intake and/or body weight in combination with any other agent or drug heretofore employed as a diet aid, or for decreasing food intake and/or body weight. Where the compound is an antagonist, the compound may be employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight in combination with any other agent or drug heretofore employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight.\n\n\nDrugs that reduce energy intake include, in part, various pharmacological agents, referred to as anorectic drugs, which are used as adjuncts to behavioral therapy in weight reduction programs. Classes of anorectic drugs include, but are not limited to, noradrenergic and serotonergic agents. Noradrenergic medications may be described as those medications generally preserving the anorectic effects of amphetamines but with weaker stimulant activity. The noradrenergic drugs, except phenylpropanolamine, generally act through a centrally mediated pathway in the hypothalamus that causes anorexia. Phenylpropanolamine, a racemic mixture of norephedrine esters, causes a release of norepinephrine throughout the body and stimulates hypothalamic adrenoreceptors to reduce appetite.\n\n\nSuitable noradrenergic agents include, but are not limited to, diethylpropion such as TENUATE™ (1-propanone, 2-(diethylamino)-1-phenyl-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Merrell; mazindol (or 5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-imidazo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-ol) such as SANOREX™ commercially available from Novartis or MAZANOR™ commercially available from Wyeth Ayerst; phenylpropanolamine (or Benzenenmethanol, alpha-(1-aminoethyl)-, hydrochloride); phentermine (or Phenol, 3-[[4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)ethyl](4-methylphenyl)amino], monohydrochloride) such as ADIPEX-P™ commercially available from Lemmon, FASTIN™ commercially available from Smith-Kline Beecham and Ionamin™ commercially available from Medeva; phendimetrazine (or (2S,3S)-3,4-Dimethyl-2phenylmorpholine L-(+)-tartrate (1:1)) such as METRA™ commercially available from Forest, PLEGINE™ commercially available from Wyeth-Ayerst; PRELU-2™ commercially available from Boehringer Ingelheim, and STATOBEX™ commercially available from Lemmon; phendamine tartrate such as THEPHORIN™ (2,3,4,9-Tetrahydro-2-methyl-9-phenyl-1H-indenol[2,1-c]pyridine L-(+)-tartrate (1:1)) commercially available from Hoffmann-LaRoche; methamphetamine such as DESOXYN™ Tablets ((S)—N, (alpha)-dimethylbenzeneethanamine hydrochloride) commercially available from Abbott; and phendimetrazine tartrate such as BONTRIL™ Slow-Release Capsules (-3,4-Dimethyl-2-phenylmorpholine Tartrate) commercially available from Amarin.\n\n\nSuitable non-limiting serotonergic agents include sibutramine such as MERIDIA™ capsules (a racemic mixture of the (+) and (−) enantiomers of cyclobutanemethanamine, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-(alpha)-(2-methylpropyl)-, hydrochloride, monohydrate) commercially available from Knoll, fenfluramine such as Pondimin™ (Benzeneethanamine, N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Robbins; dexfenfluramine such as Redux™ (Benzeneethanamine, N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Interneuron. Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine stimulate release of serotonin and inhibit its reuptake. Sibutramine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, but does not stimulate secretion of serotonin.\n\n\nOther serotonergic agents useful with the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, certain auoretic gene 5HT1a inhibitors (brain, serotonin) such as carbidopa and benserazide as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,699 which is incorporated herein by reference; and \ncertain neurokinin\n 1 receptor antagonists and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxtine, sertraline and other useful compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,805 which is incorporated herein by reference. Other potential inhibitors that may be employed include 5HT2c inhibitors.\n\n\nOther useful compounds for reducing energy intake include, but are not limited to, certain aryl-substituted cyclobutylalkylamines as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,424 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain trifluoromethylthiophenylethylamine derivatives as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,923 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,699 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain kainite or AMPA receptor antagonists as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,191,117 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain \nneuropeptide receptor subtype\n 5 as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,354 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain alpha-blocking agents as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,763 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nMoreover, several peptides and hormones regulate feeding behavior. For example, cholecystokinin and serotonin act to decrease appetite and food intake. Leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, controls food intake and energy expenditure. In obese persons who are losing weight without medications, a decrease in weight is associated with a decrease in circulating levels of leptin, suggesting its role in weight homeostasis. Obese patients with high leptin levels are thought to have peripheral leptin resistance secondary to the down-regulation of leptin receptors. Non-limiting examples of useful compounds affecting feeding behavior include certain leptin-lipolysis stimulated receptors as disclosed by WO 01/21647 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitors as disclosed by WO 01/35970 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain compounds having nucleotide sequences of the mahogany gene as disclosed by WO 00/05373 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain sapogenin compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,289 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nOther useful compounds include certain gamma peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as disclosed by WO 01/30343 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,656 which are incorporated herein by reference and certain polypeptides such as fibroblast growth factor-10 polypeptides as disclosed by WO 01/18210 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nMoreover, monoamine oxidase inhibitors that decrease energy intake or increase energy expenditure are useful with the practice of the present invention. Suitable, but non-limiting examples of monoamine oxidase inhibitors include befloxatone, moclobemide, brofaromine, phenoxathine, esuprone, befol, toloxatone, pirlindol, amiflamine, sercloremine, bazinaprine, lazabemide, milacemide, caroxazone and other certain compounds as disclosed by WO 01/12176 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nCertain compounds that increase lipid metabolism are also useful with the practice of the present invention. Such compounds include, but are not limited to, useful evodiamine compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,831 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nNutrient partitioning agents and digestive inhibitors are another strategy in the treatment of obesity by interfering with the breakdown, digestion or absorption of dietary fat in the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric and pancreatic lipases aid in the digestion of dietary triglycerides by forming them into free fatty acids that are then absorbed in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzymes leads to inhibition of the digestion of dietary triglycerides. Non-limiting examples include a lipase inhibitor, orlistat, such as XENICAL™ capsules ((S)-2-formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (S)-1-[[(2S,3S)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]-dodecyl ester) commercially available from Roche Laboratories and certain benzoxazinone compounds as described by WO 00/40247 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAgents that increase energy expenditure are also referred to as thermogenic medications. Non-limiting examples of suitable thermogenic medications include xanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, selective β-3-adrenergic agonists for example certain compounds in U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,549 which is incorporated by reference herein, and α-2-adrenergic and growth hormones compounds as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,937,267 and 5,120,713 which are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nGenerally, a total dosage of the above-described obesity control agents or medications, when used in combination with a compound of this invention can range from 0.1 to 3,000 mg/day, preferably from about 1 to 1,000 mg/day and more preferably from about 1 to 200 mg/day in single or 2-4 divided doses. The exact dose, however, is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent on such factors as the potency of the compound administered, the age, weight, condition and response of the patient.\n\n\nAgents or drugs employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight include appetite stimulants such as megastrol acetate, adrenocorticoids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, cyproheptidine, serotonergic drugs such as fenfluramine, neuropeptide Y, and androgen antagonists such as flutamide, nilutamide, and zanoterone.\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention. As discussed hereafter in the synthetic schemes, one preferred method of making the compounds of the invention includes synthesis of a linear intermediate composed of chiral building blocks such as amino acid residues or derivatives, which intermediate includes the R\n1 \ngroup and an R\n2 \ngroup, and one of or, if provided, both an R\n4 \nand R\n5 \ngroup, as shown below. The linear intermediate is then cyclicized, and other groups, such as R\n3\n, are then added. Thus in this embodiment R\n1 \nand R\n4 \ncan be considered to be amino acid side chain moieties, as defined above. In other of the synthetic schemes, the linear intermediate includes the R\n2 \ngroup, and one of R\n4 \nor R\n5\n, with the R\n1 \ngroup synthetically added post-cyclization. In the synthetic methods the R\n3 \ngroup is an amino acid residue or derivative, optionally with an amine capping group, second amino acid residue or derivative, or second amino acid residue or derivative and amine capping group. It may thus be seen that the compounds of the invention may be considered as a 6-membered ring compound of the formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \nX is CH\n2\n, C═O or C═S;\n \nR\n1 \nis an amino acid side chain moiety including at least one carbocyclic aromatic or non-aromatic ring or heterocyclic aromatic ring, and in a preferred embodiment includes a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, naphthyl or indole group;\n \nR\n2 \nis an amino acid side chain moiety with at least one heteroatom cationic center, hydrogen bond donor or hydrogen bond acceptor, wherein the least one heteroatom is nitrogen or oxygen;\n \nR\n3 \nincludes at least one amino acid residue with at least one carbocyclic aromatic ring and in a preferred embodiment, includes a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl group; and\n \nAt least one of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis R\n2 \nor a C\n1 \nto C\n6 \naliphatic linear or branched chain.\n \n \n \n\n\nIt may readily be seen that the foregoing description is simplified, in that at each of R\n2\n, R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nthere is assumed to further be a hydrogen atom bound to the respective ring carbon.\n\n\nThus, by way of example, R\n1 \ncan be an amino acid side chain moiety, including but not limited to one of the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn any of the foregoing, it is understood that any ring may be substituted with one or more ring substitutents, such as hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, R\n2 \nmay be an amino acid side chain moiety, including but not limited to one of the following:\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═O)—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═O)—O—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—NH—C(═O)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—NH—C(═O)—H,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—NH—C(═O)—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═O)—NH—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—S(O\n2\n)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—S(O\n2\n)—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—C(═O)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH—CH—(CH\n3\n)\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—NH—C(═O)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH\n2\n,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nParticularly preferred are side chains of arginine, lysine and ornithine, including derivatives of arginine, lysine and ornithine.\n\n\n\nR\n3\n, which includes least one amino acid residue with at least one carbocyclic aromatic ring, may be of any of the formulas -A\n1\n, -A\n1\n-cGp, -A\n1\n-A\n2 \nor -A\n1\n-A\n2\n-cGp, where A\n1 \nis an amino acid with an aromatic carbocyclic ring, A\n2 \nis an L-amino acid, and cGp is an amine capping group. Thus for example it can be seen that the following compounds are contemplated and included within the invention:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn a preferred embodiment, A\n1 \nis a D-amino acid with an aromatic carbocyclic ring. Thus A\n1 \nmay be a D-isomer of Phe, Phe(2-Cl), Phe(4-Cl), Phe(2,4-diCl), Phe(2,4-diF), Phe(3,4-diCl), Phe(4-NO\n2\n), Phe(4-Me), Phe(4-Phenyl), HPhe, Phe(4-F), Phe(4-Br), Phe(4-CF\n3\n), Phe(3,4-diF), Phe(4-I), Phe(2-Cl, 4-Me), Phe(2-Me, 4-Cl), Phe(2-F, 4-Cl), Phe(2,4-diMe), Phe(2-Cl, 4-CF\n3\n), or Phe(3,4-di-OMe). Alternatively, A\n1 \nmay be a D-isomer of Pgl, Trp, \nNal\n 1, \nNal\n 2, Bip, Dip, Bpa, Ser(Bzl), Ser(2-Naphthyl), Ser(Phenyl), Ser(4-Cl-Phenyl), Ser(2-Cl-Phenyl), Lys(Z), Lys(Z-2′Br), Lys(Bz), Thr(Bzl), Tic, Tiq, Cys(Bzl), Tyr(2,6-DiCl-Bzl) or Tyr(Bzl). A\n2\n, where provided, can be an L-isomer of Abu, 2-Abz, 3-Abz, 4-Abz, Achc, Acpc, Aib, Amb, Arg(Tos), Asp(anilino), Asp(3-Cl-anilino), Asp(3,5-diCl-anilino), 11-Aun, AVA, Beta-hHyp(Bzl), Cha, Chg, Cmpi, Disc, Dpr(beta-Ala), GAA, GBzA, B-Gpa, GVA(Cl), His, hSer, Ser(Bzl), Tic, hHyp, Hyp(Bzl), Inp, 2-Naphthylacetyl, (Nlys)Gly, OcHx, Pip, 4-phenylPro, 5-phenylPro, Pyr, Sar, Tle, Tiq, Atc, Igl, Hyp(O-2-Naphthyl), Hyp(O-Phenyl), 2-Aic, Idc, 1-Aic, Beta-homoSer(Bzl), Ser(2-Naphthyl), Ser(Phenyl), Ser(4-Cl-Phenyl), Ser(2-Cl-Phenyl), Thr(Bzl), Tic, Beta-homoThr(Bzl), Thr(2-Naphthyl), Thr(Phenyl), Thr(4-Cl-Phenyl), Thr(2-Cl-Phenyl), Nle, Leu, Ile, Val or Beta-Ala.

The efficacy and functional activity of compounds of this invention can be modulated by selection of the linker units and other substituents, such as R\n4 \nand/or R\n5 \ngroups, which influence the conformational biasness of R\n1 \nand R\n3 \ngroups. Efficacy and functional activity may be determined by any number of means, such as assaying the stimulation of adenyl cyclase in a cAMP assay as hereafter described.\n\n\nFor example, the chemical nature of either or both the L\n1 \nor L\n3 \nlinker units, and the incorporation of a substituent at one or more specific R\n4a\n, R\n4b\n, R\n5a \nor R\n5b \npositions, can change otherwise identical compounds from a partial agonist to a full agonist as determined by adenyl cyclase assays in an hMCR-4 transfected HEK cell system. The nature and character of these changes is described, in part, in the following discussion.\n\n\nA commercially available computer based molecular modeling software system, such as Alchemy (Tripos), can be used to study the conformational dynamics within the compounds of this invention. Studies using such a molecular modeling software system can explain, in part, the effect of changes such as the chemical nature of either or both the L\n1 \nor L\n3 \nlinker units or the incorporation of a substituent at one or more specific R\n4a\n, R\n4b\n, R\n5a \nor R\n5b \npositions on biological activity.\n\n\nA piperazine ring can exhibit conformational dynamics between chair and boat conformations, with twisted chair and twisted boat conformations being special cases. In the following discussion, chair and boat conformations are used for purposes of illustration. Assume a piperazine, where X is CH\n2\n, and a conventional ring atom numbering system as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAs may readily be seen, both the 1 and 4 position nitrogens are substituted with an R group. As a direct result thereof, the conformation of the ring is biased toward a chair conformation, because this conformation offers a very low likelihood of steric interactions involving aromatic R\n1 \nand R\n3 \ngroups. This may be seen in the following illustration, wherein the equatorial placement of R\n1 \nand R\n3 \nin the Chair Form results in a conformationally preferred structure, while the close proximity of the ring nitrogens with R\n1 \nand R\n3 \ngroups in the Boat Form (indicated by the double arrow) make the Boat Form conformationally disfavored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the nature of the 1, 4 ring nitrogens, and resulting bond angles, is determined by the nature of the L\n1 \nand L\n3 \nlinkers. For example, both nitrogens are in the sp\n3 \nconfiguration if L\n1 \nand L\n3 \nare of the (CH\n2\n)\ny \ntype. In this case, the R\n1 \nand R\n3 \ngroups orient as equatorial groups on the chair configuration and have a high degree of conformational freedom in space due to rotational freedom of C—C single bonds in these groups as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand both nitrogens exist in the sp\n2 \nconfiguration if L\n1 \nand L\n3 \nhave, for example, an initial carbonyl group, such as a linker unit of the —C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\ny\n— type. In this instance, the carbonyl groups of the ring nitrogen amide functions necessarily exist in one of two rigid forms, similar to cis or trans amide forms. This specific orientation of the carbonyl groups in turn restricts the orientation of the J and Q groups. Therefore, where L\n1 \nand L\n3 \ninclude an initial carbonyl group, the R\n1 \nand R\n3 \ngroups have conformational orientations that are different from those in compounds without ring nitrogen amide functions, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inventors have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that selective orientation of the R\n1 \ngroup in compounds of this invention, by the means discussed above, causes a shift or change in efficacy, such as determined by functional activity in an adenyl cyclase cell assay, but without significantly influencing receptor binding affinity. For example, compounds described herein where L\n1 \nis attached to the ring nitrogen through an amide bond are full agonists with intrinsic activity at MC4-R ranging from 80 to 100% (see the compounds of Examples 38, 42, 43, 44 and 45). However, compounds described herein where L\n1 \nis attached through an ethylene group are antagonists or partial agonists with significantly lower intrinsic activity, or have no intrinsic activity, either with or without loss of affinity for MC4-R (see the compounds of Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8).\n\n\nThe substituents at position 5 and 6 of the piperazine ring also have a significant influence on the orientation of the R\n1 \nand R\n3 \ngroups. For example an R\n4 \ngroup in the general structure of this invention influences the spatial preference of the R\n3 \ngroup, and likewise an R\n5 \ngroup influences the spatial preference of the R\n1 \ngroup. The major influence of these groups on biological activity is seen in a stereo-specific manner. For example, the presence of an R\n5 \nsubstituent, such as methyl or isobutyl, in an (S)-configuration cause severe steric constraint on the J group in compounds where L\n1 \nis a —(CH\n2\n)\ny\n— linker unit. This is because both J as well as the (S)-configuration of the R\n5 \ngroup are positioned in a close chemical space. Steric hindrance between these two groups causes perturbations in the overall orientation of the R\n1 \ngroup, resulting in a structure that is less conducive to receptor affinity and functional efficacy of the compounds. Typically, a 5-15 fold loss of MC4-R affinity has been observed. Similarly, in compounds where L\n1 \nis a —C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\ny\n— linker, the incorporation of an (S)-configuration of the R\n5 \ngroup causes the amide carbonyl to position away from the R\n5 \ngroup, again with a similar potential of steric interaction with J group. However, positioning of the L\n1 \ncarbonyl towards an (S)-configuration of the R\n5 \ngroup is not possible due to severe steric interactions between these groups. These three situations can be shown as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, incorporation of an R\n5 \nsubstituent, such as methyl or isobutyl, in an (R)-configuration positions the R\n5 \ngroup away from the R\n1 \ngroup. Since there is no perturbation in the positioning of R\n1 \ngroup, this causes no change in MC4-R receptor affinity and selectivity. These structures are shown as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporation of an R\n4 \nsubstituent, such as methyl or isobutyl in either the (R)- or (S)-configuration at the position 6 of the piperazine ring cause severe steric constraint on the Q group in compounds where L\n3 \nincludes a carbonyl, such as a —C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\ny\n— linker. This is because the spatial orientation of Q is already influenced by the presence of an R\n2 \ngroup at the position 2 of the piperazine ring. Furthermore, the (S)-configuration R\n2 \nand (R)-configuration R\n4 \ngroups are axially located. These groups have 1,3-diaxial steric interactions that distort the chair conformer of the piperazine ring. The R\n4 \ngroup in its equatorial (S)-configuration form causes severe steric interaction with the carbonyl of the L\n3 \nlinker, as well as the Q group when L\n3 \nis a linker unit such as —(CH\n2\n)\ny\n—. Therefore, incorporation of an R\n4 \ngroup in either stereochemical orientation leads to compounds that have somewhat weaker receptor affinity (typically a 5-7 fold decrease has been observed). These three situations can be shown as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is evident from the foregoing that the incorporation of R\n4 \nand/or R\n5 \ngroups can be employed to modify the functional efficacy of these high-affinity melanocortin compounds. These findings may be used, as described herein, to develop compounds that are agonists, weak partial agonists, mixed agonist-antagonists, antagonists or have no intrinsic activity, and which have utility as agents for modulation of energy homeostasis and feeding responses in mammals.\n\n\nSteric interaction may be shown by reference to \nFIG. 1\n, showing the structure of a hypothetical compound wherein R\n1 \nand R\n3 \nare each phenylacetyl, R\n2 \nis (S)-3-aminopropyl, and R\n5 \nis (S)-isobutyl (\nFIG. 1A\n) or (R)-isobutyl (\nFIG. 1B\n). As may be seen from \nFIG. 1\n, there is significant steric interaction with (S)-isobutyl (\nFIG. 1A\n) where L\n1 \nincludes a carbonyl, but not with (R)-isobutyl.\n\n\nCompounds which bind with high affinity, but which have low or no intrinsic activity, are illustrated by compounds of the following general structure which are disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRatio\n \nIntrinsic\n \n \n \n \n \nKi (nM)\n \n(MC1-R/\n \nefficacy\n \n \n \n \n \nEx.\n \nR\n5\n \n \nR\n4\n \n \nMC1-R\n \nMC3-R\n \nMC4-R\n \nMC5-R\n \nMC4-R)\n \nMC4-R\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n—\n \nH\n \nH\n \n1198\n \n97\n \n3\n \n259\n \n399\n \n37%\n \n \n \n1\n \nH\n \n(R)-CH\n3\n \n \n1309\n \n366\n \n15\n \n727\n \n87\n \n3%\n \n \n \n4\n \nH\n \n(S)-CH\n3\n \n \n3185\n \n551\n \n21\n \n602\n \n152\n \n11%\n \n \n \n2\n \n(R)-CH\n3\n \n \nH\n \n1134\n \n95\n \n2\n \n362\n \n567\n \n3%\n \n \n \n3\n \n(S)-CH\n3\n \n \nH\n \n673\n \n362\n \n14\n \n723\n \n48\n \n6%\n \n \n \n8\n \n(R)-iso-\n \nH\n \n1364\n \n87\n \n4\n \n160\n \n341\n \n0%\n \n \n \n \n \nButyl\n \n \n \n7\n \n(S)-iso-\n \nH\n \n5895\n \n495\n \n48\n \n695\n \n123\n \n4%\n \n \n \n \n \nButyl\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe initial compound, wherein R\n5 \nand R\n4 \nare H, is disclosed as Example 129 in PCT/US02/25574, entitled Peptidomimetics of Biologically Active Molecules, filed on Aug. 12, 2002, and incorporated herein by reference. In the foregoing table, intrinsic efficacy or activity less than about 10% is not distinguishable from no intrinsic activity. Thus, for example, the compound of Example 8 binds with high affinity (4 nM) at MC4-R, but has no intrinsic activity. The compound of Example 8 is accordingly inactive as to MC4-R in terms of agonist/antagonist status with respect to NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\n\nSynthetic Schemes. Distinct and separate methods for synthesis of piperazines and ketopiperazines are required. In many synthetic schemes, piperazine molecules as described herein cannot be obtained from ketopiperazine molecules or synthetic schemes as described herein. One obvious limitation to employing ketopiperazine synthetic schemes to synthesize piperazine molecules is that the presence of other reactive groups, such as amide, halogen and aromatic functional groups, can interfere with the process of reducing a ketopiperazine to a piperazine. Thus separate and different methods for the synthesis of piperazines were developed and are disclosed herein. Similarly, separate methods for the synthesis of ketopiperazines were also developed and are disclosed here.\n\n\nOne general strategy for either class of compounds includes developing a linear intermediate using chiral building blocks such as amino acid derivatives. The linear intermediate can be cyclized using a Mitsunobo reaction strategy (Mitsunobo, O. The use of diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine in synthesis and transformation of natural products. \nSynthesis \n1:1-28 (1981)), or by spontaneous cyclization through reactive groups such as a reaction between an amine and an aldehyde functional group or an amine and an ester functional group. In these cyclizations, the driving force for intramolecular reaction versus intermolecular reaction is the thermodynamically favored reaction forming a six-membered ring structure.\n\n\n \nScheme\n 4 presented hereafter is an example of a Mitsunobo reaction mediated cyclization. This methodology incorporates conditions that do not involve inversion or racemization of chiral centers, other than inversion of the chiral center on the carbon to which an —OH group is attached.\n\n\nThe methods disclosed herein thus allow for the synthesis of piperazine as well as ketopiperazine molecules with the diverse functionalities disclosed herein. Certain of the schemes further provide a facile approach to obtain compounds that differ at R\n3 \nsince this group is introduced after the cyclic intermediate has been synthesized.\n\n\nThe piperazine compounds of the invention have three stereocenters, such that at each of three distinct carbon atoms the molecule can assume any permissible stereochemical configuration, such that eight distinct stereo configurations (2\nn \nwhere n is 3) are both possible and contemplated in this invention. Thus the invention includes compounds with stereo configurations as set forth below (where X is CH\n2 \nor C═O). It is further understood that for the R\n2\n, R\n4 \nand R\n5 \npositions, as heretofore defined, where a group other than hydrogen is provided for such position, that the position includes such group in one of R\nxa \nor R\nxb\n, and hydrogen in the remaining of R\nxa \nor R\nxb\n. Thus, for example, R\n2 \nmay be in either the R\n2a \nor R\n2b \nposition, with the remaining position being hydrogen. In one embodiment, R\n2a \nis —(CH\n2\n)\ny\n—NH—C(═NH)—NH\n2 \nand R\n2b \nis hydrogen, or vice versa, and so on. It may thus be seen that all possible stereochemical configurations are included within the disclosure of this invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of Dipeptide (1-2): The dipeptide (1-2) synthesized in \nScheme\n 1 employs an amino alcohol derivative of a suitable omega-protected alpha omega amino acid. This omega protecting group is orthogonal to the N-Prt group, such that one protecting group can be removed in the presence of the other. 7.8 mL (56 mmol, 1.35 equiv) of TEA was added to a solution of 40 mmol of protected amino acid (1.1) in 200 mL dry THF, kept at −20° C. under N\n2\n, followed by the slow addition of 7.2 mL (55 mmol, 1.35 equiv) of IBCF. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. 9.4 g (60 mmol, 1.5 equiv) of serine methyl ester hydrochloride or an amino alcohol derivative was added, followed by 8.4 mL (60 mmol, 1 equiv) of TEA, keeping the temperature below −20° C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at −10° C., and then allowed to warm to room temperature. 50 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid was added, and the layers separated. The organic layer was concentrated, redissolved in 150 mL of EtOAc, and washed with 2×50 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid, and 1×50 mL saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The dipeptide (1-2) was purified by silica gel chromatography as necessary.\n\n\nAlternate Synthesis of Dipeptide (1-2): The dipeptide can also be prepared by any common peptide synthesis protocol, such as for example using HBTU as the coupling reagent. To a solution of 14.3 mmol of protected amino acid (1-1) in 30 mL of dry dimethylformamide (DMF), kept at room temperature under N\n2\n, was added 5.44 g (14.3 mmol, 1 equiv) of HBTU, followed by 7.5 mL (43.1 mmol, 3 equiv) of diisopropylethyl amine (DIEA). The solution was stirred for 5 minutes, and then 2.5 g (16.1 mmol, 1.1 equiv) of serine methyl ester hydrochloride was added in one portion. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, diluted with 100 mL of diethyl ether, and washed with 2×50 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, and the dipeptide (1-2) purified by silica gel chromatography as necessary.\n\n\nSynthesis of ketopiperazine (1-3): To a solution of 5.75 mmol of dipeptide (1-2) in 40 mL of dry DCM, kept at −20° C. under N\n2\n, was added 1.0 mL (7.5 mmol, 1.3 equiv) of TEA, followed by the slow addition of 530 μL (6.9 mmol, 1.2 equiv) of methanesulfonyl chloride, keeping the temperature below −10° C. The mixture was stirred at −10° C. for 15 minutes, and then allowed to warm to room temperature. It was stirred at room temperature until HPLC showed the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was then concentrated and partitioned between 25 mL of ether and 25 mL of water. The organic layer was washed with 1×25 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated. The product (1-3) was purified by silica gel chromatography as necessary.\n\n\nSynthesis of piperazine (1-4): To a solution of 2.9 mmol of ketopiperazine (1-3) in 7 mL of dioxane, kept at room temperature under N\n2\n, was added 550 mg (14.5 mmol, 5 equiv) of sodium borohydride, followed by the slow addition of a solution of 820 mL (14.3 mmol, 5 equiv) of acetic acid in 2 mL of dioxane, and the suspension was then refluxed under N\n2 \nfor 4 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then quenched by the slow addition of 1 N hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was diluted with 25 mL of EtOAc and 15 mL of water. The layers were separated, and the organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate. The product (1-4) was purified by silica gel chromatography as necessary.\n\n\nSynthesis of functionalized piperazine (1-5): The secondary amine functionality of piperazine (1-4) was reacted with a carboxylic acid derivative oaf a desired R\n1 \ngroup (J-COOH) to establish an amide bond. Well-established standard methods of peptide synthesis can be employed. Alternatively, N-functionalization can also be achieved by treating a bromo or iodo derivative of an R\n1 \n(J-Br) with functionalized piperazine.\n\n\nSynthesis of functionalized piperazine (1-6): The ring N-Prt group from compound (1-5) is removed and the free amine treated with Q-COOH or a corresponding Q-bromide to obtain 1-6.\n\n\nSynthesis of fully functionalized piperazine (1-7, and 1-8): The NH-Prt′ group from the functionalized piperazine (1-6) is removed to give 1-7. The amine function of 1-7 can further be alkylated, guanidinated or acetylated using standard procedures to give compounds of the general structure 1-8. Alkylation can be accomplished by a reductive amination reaction with an aldehyde (for example, formaldehyde) under the conditions described in synthesis of 3-4, using alkyl bromide (for example, CH\n3\n—Br), or acylation using a carboxylic acid (CH\n3\n—OOH), with guanidation using triphenylphorphine, DIAD, and 1,3-Bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine as reagents followed by removal of Boc groups as described in \nScheme\n 5. A guanidation reaction can also be performed using 1,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea (1.1 equiv) and silver nitrate (1.1 equiv) and NMM (2.2 equiv) as reagents in acetonitrile as discussed in \nScheme\n 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of functionalized ketopiperazines (2-2 and 2-3): The NH-Prt′ group in ketopiperazine (1-3) is removed and the resulting amine is processed further to introduce an R\n3 \ngroup as generally described for the synthesis of substituted piperazine (1-6) in \nScheme\n 1. The amine function of 2-2 can be introduced to produce compound 2-3 using a similar approach as described for the conversion of 1-7 to 1-8 in \nScheme\n 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of J-COOH (e.g., naphthylacetic acid) and HOAt (1 equiv) in dry N,N-dimethylformamide was added 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride (1 equiv). After the mixture was stirred at room temperature for one-half hour, a chiral amino alcohol (e.g., (R)- or (S)-1-amino-2-propanol or (R)- or (S)-2-amino-1-propanol, affording a methyl group at R\n5 \nor R\n4\n, respectively) (1 equiv) was added. The reaction was continued for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted by EtOAc twice. The organic layer was washed by 1 N hydrochloric acid twice, 1 N sodium hydroxide twice, brine and dried over sodium sulfate. After evaporation, the product was purified on silica gel column with 10% methanol in methylene chloride.\n\n\nTo this product (1 equiv) and sodium borohydride (5 equiv) in dioxane was added acetic acid (5 equiv) in dioxane slowly. After completion, the mixture was refluxed for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched by water. The product was extracted from ether by 1 N hydrochloric acid. The pH value of the resulting aqueous solution was adjusted with potassium hydroxide to around 11, and the product extracted by ether three times. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated. The obtained compound 3-1 was used for next step reaction without further purification.\n\n\nTo an N-protected amino acid (3-2) (1 equiv), and N-methyl morpholine (1 equiv) in dry DCM was added TBTU (1 equiv). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. A mixture of N,O-dimethylhydroxyamine hydrochloride (1.5 equiv) and NMM (1.5 equiv) in DCM was stirred for 30 minutes. These two mixtures were combined and stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The organic solvent was evaporated and the residue loaded on a flash chromatograph column and eluted with EtOAc/hexane (2/1) to yield an N,O-dimethylhydroxyamide product. This product was dissolved in dry THF at 0° C. and LAH (1 M in THF, 1.2 equiv) was added slowly. After 30 minutes the reaction was quenched by aqueous potassium hydrogen sulfate (1.2 equiv). THF was removed and ether was added. The solution was washed by 1 N HCl (2 times), aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed under vacuum to give compound 3-3. Compound 3-3 was used for next step reaction without further purification.\n\n\nA mixture of compound 3-3 and compound 3-1 was stirred in the presence of activated 4 Å molecular sieves (1 g) in dry THF (10% acetic acid) for 1 hour. Sodium cyanoborohydride (1 equiv, 1 M solution in THF) was added to this mixture. After 2 hours, solvent was evaporated and the desired product (34) was purified on silica gel column.\n\n\nCompound 3-4 was treated with 20% diethylamine in EtOAc for 12 hours, with the solvent evaporated to dryness. The residue and TPP (3 equiv) was dissolved in dry THF. To this solution was added DIAD (3 equiv) in THF slowly at 0° C. The reaction was continued for 16 hours at room temperature. The product 3-5 was purified by silica gel column after evaporation of solvent.\n\n\nThe R\n3 \ngroup was introduced in compound 3-5 by coupling it with an appropriate amino acid (2 equiv), such as D-Phe or a ring-substituted derivative or homolog thereof, by use of HOAt (2 equiv) and DIC (2 equiv) in N,N-dimethylformamide solution overnight at room temperature. Flash chromatograph (EtOAc/hexane=2) gave the product with protecting groups. The Fmoc group was removed by treatment with 20% diethyl amine in EtOAc, and the Boc group was removed by treatment with 30% TFA in methylene chloride for 1 hour, as applicable to the compounds. The final pure compounds (3-6) were obtained by purification on HPLC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-Benzyloxycarbonylamino-5-phthalimido-pentanoic acid (4-1) was synthesized from a mixture of Z-ornithine (1 equiv), N-carethoxy-phthalimide (1 equiv), and TEA (1.2 equiv) in dry THF and refluxed overnight. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in EtOAc, and washed successively with 1 N HCl, water, brine, dried (MgSO\n4\n) and evaporated in vacuo to afford the crude product, which was used for the next reaction without further purification.\n\n\nThe crude product (4-1) was dissolved in 5 mL of THF and to the solution was added NMM (1 equiv). The solution was cooled to −15° C. with a salt-ice bath, and IBCF (1 equiv) added. After 10 minutes, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove formed solid salt. The solid was washed twice with adequate amounts of THF. The filtrate was cooled to −10° C. and to it was added NaBH\n4 \n(1.5 equiv) in water. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 15 minutes, and then concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed successively with 10% citric acid, saturated NaHCO\n3\n, H\n2\nO and saturated NaCl, and then dried (MgSO\n4\n) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified with column chromatography eluted with 1:1 EtOAc-hexanes. The purified product, [4-Phthalimido-1-hydroxymethyl-butyl]-carbamic acid benzyl ester (4-2), is obtained as a white solid.\n\n\nAt −20° C. under N\n2 \nto the suspension of 4-2 and TPP (1.5 equiv) in toluene was added tetrabromocarbon (1.1 equiv) and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the crude product purified by column chromatography eluted with hexanes and EtOAc (2:1). The purified product, [1-Bromomethyl-4-phthalimido-butyl]-carbamic acid benzyl ester (4-3), was obtained as a white solid.\n\n\nA mixture of 4-3 and an aminoalcohol (3-1) synthesized according to Scheme 3 (2 equiv) in DCM was stirred at 65° C. The solvent was evaporated and the dried reaction mixture heated at 65° C. for 2 hours. The formed crude product was purified by column chromatography and eluted with hexanes (EtOAc 1:2) to give 4-4.\n\n\nAt room temperature under nitrogen a mixture of 4-4 (0.41 mmol) and palladium black (80 mg) in 21 mL of 4% HCHO in methanol is stirred vigorously for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is filtered and the filtrate neutralized with saturated NaHCO\n3\n. The methanol is evaporated and the residue dissolved in EtOAc and washed successively with saturated NaHCO\n3\n, water and saturated NaCl, then dried (MgSO\n4\n) and evaporated. The product 4-5 is collected as a white solid.\n\n\nAt 0° C. under nitrogen to the mixture of 4-5 and TPP (1.5 equiv) in anhydrous THF was added diethyl azodicarbonate (1.1 equiv) in anhydrous THF. After stirring at room temperature for 4 hours, the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo and the crude product purified by column chromatography. The product 4-6 was obtained.\n\n\nTo a mixture of 4-6 (1 equiv), a desired carboxylic acid or appropriate protected amino acid residue, including without limitation ring-substituted D-Phe analogs and homologs (2 equiv), and HOAt (2 equiv) in DMF was added diisopropylcarboimide (2 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the crude product purified by column chromatography (eluted with hexanes, EtOAc 1:2). The purified product 4-7 was obtained as a white solid.\n\n\nA solution of 4-7 in 10 mL of 0.2 M hydrazine in methanol was stirred at room temperature for 19 hours. Mass spectroscopy showed no starting material left in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was evaporated and co-evaporated three times with methanol and once with EtOAc, then dried under high vacuum for 2 days. The crude product 4-8 was used for the next reaction without further purification.\n\n\n10 mg of the crude product 4-8 was treated with 3 mL of 33% TFA in DCM at room temperature for 2.5 hours. The solvent was removed by evaporation and the crude product purified by HPLC (10-90-60, in an acetonitrile-water gradient flow). After lyophilization of the collected fractions, the product 4-9 was obtained as white solid.\n\n\nAlternatively, the crude product 4-8 was reacted with 1,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea (1.1 equiv) and silver nitrate (1.1 equiv) and NMM (2.2 equiv) in 5 mL of acetonitrile at room temperature for 24 hours, followed by evaporation to remove the solvent and column chromatography purification to produce the 4-10. Product 4-10 was treated with 33% TFA in DCM at room temperature for 2 hours and the reaction mixture concentrated and purified with HPLC to give the final compound 4-11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of compound Fmoc-Glutamol(OBut) (5-1) in DCM was added 1,1,1-triacetoxy-1,1-dihydro-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one (1.1 equiv) in portions. After stirring for 30 minutes at room temperature, the solution was diluted by ether, followed by addition of 25% sodium thiosulphate in an aqueous solution saturated with sodium bicarbonate. The mixture was stirred for an additional 5 minutes and the desired compound was extracted by EtOAc. The organic layer was washed by saturated bicarbonate solution, water and subsequently dried over magnesium sulfate. After evaporation of solvent, compound 5-2 was obtained for the next step reaction without further purification.\n\n\nA mixture of compound 5-2, (R)- or (S)-amino acid methyl ester (1 equiv), or another selected amino acid methyl ester, such as an alpha amino acid with its side chain appearing as R\n5 \nin the final compound 5-8, and TEA (1 equiv) in the presence of a 4 Å molecular sieve in dry THF was stirred for two hours. After addition of sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.5 equiv) the mixture was stirred for an additional 16 hours. The solid was removed by filtration and the product extracted by EtOAc from water. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate. After evaporation of solvent the residue was dissolved in EtOAc containing 20% diethylamine. The reaction was carried out for 16 hours and solvent removed under vacuum. The product 5-3 was obtained after purification by chromatography.\n\n\nTo a solution of a desired carboxylic acid (1 equiv), or a related acid constituting itself as R\n1 \nin the final compound 5-8, and N-methylmorpholine (1 equiv) in DCM at −15° C. was added isopropyl chloroformate (1 equiv) slowly.

The following assays and animal models were employed, with modifications as discussed in the examples.\n\n\nCompetitive inhibition assay. A competitive inhibition binding assay was conducted using membranes prepared from hMC3-R, hMC4-R, hMC5-R, and B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing MC1-R) using 0.4 nM \n125\nI-NDP-α-MSH (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA) in 50 mM HEPES buffer containing 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 5 mM KCl, at pH 7.2. The assay tube also contained a chosen concentration of the test compound of this invention, typically a 1 μM concentration, for determining its efficacy in inhibiting the binding of \n125\nI-NDP-α-MSH to its receptor. Non-specific binding was measured by complete inhibition of binding of \n125\nI-NDP-α-MSH in the assay with the presence of 1 μM α-MSH.\n\n\nIncubation was for 90 minutes at room temperature, after which the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice cold buffer. The filter was dried and counted in a gamma counter for remaining radioactivity bound to the membranes. 100% specific binding was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM A-MSH. The cpm obtained in presence of test compounds were normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of \n125\nI-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%.\n\n\nEC\n50 \ndetermination in functional activity assay. The Ki (nM) of certain compounds of the invention were determined. Functional evaluation of compounds at melanocortin receptors was performed by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cAMP in HEK-293 cells expressing MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R, and in B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing MC1-R). Cells, suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.1% albumin and 0.6 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were plated in 96 well plates at a density of 0.5×10\n5 \ncells per well. Cells were incubated with the test compounds in the presence or absence of α-MSH for 1 hour at 37° C. cAMP levels were measured by EIA (Amersham) in the cell lysates. Data analysis and EC\n50 \nvalues were determined using nonlinear regression analysis with Prism Graph-Pad software.\n\n\nFunctional status. The agonist/antagonist status with respect to MC1-4, MC4-R, and MC5-R of certain compounds of the invention was determined. Antagonistic activity was determined by measuring the inhibition of α-MSH-induced or NDP-α-MSH-induced cAMP levels following exposure to the compounds as in the preceding descriptions.\n\n\nPenile erection induction. The ability of compounds to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats were evaluated with selected compounds. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies were performed between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Groups of 4-8 rats were treated with compounds at a variety of doses via intravenous (IV) or intracerebroventricular (ICV) routes. Immediately after treatment, rats were placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation. Rats were observed for 30 minutes IV or 90 minutes ICV, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs were recorded in 10-minute bins.\n\n\nICV food intake and body weight change. Change in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected compounds. Rats with indwelling intracerebroventricular cannulas (ICV rats) were obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottdale, Pa.). Animals were individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/12 hour off light cycle. Water and powdered (LabDiet, 5P00 Prolab RMH 3000) or pelleted (Harlan Teklad 2018 18% Protein Rodent Diet) food was provided ad libitum. For 1 week before treatment, 24-hour food intake and body weight change was recorded to assess a baseline for the group during vehicle treatment. The rats were dosed ICV with vehicle or selected compounds (1-3 nmol). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing were determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour period, and in same cases for 72 hours as well, after dosing were also measured to determined reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effect back to baseline.\n\n\nIV food intake and body weight change. Change in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected compounds. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Taconic (Germantown, N.Y.). Animals were individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/12 hour off light cycle. Water and powdered (LabDiet, 5P00Prolab RMH 3000) or pelleted (Harlan Teklad 2018 18% Protein Rodent Diet) food was provided ad libitum. For 1 week before treatment, 24-hour food intake and body weight change was recorded to assess a baseline for the group during vehicle treatment. The rats were dosed IV with vehicle or selected compounds (0.5-3 mg/kg). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing were determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour period, and in same cases for 72 hours as well, after dosing were also measured to determined reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effect back to baseline.\n\n\nBehavioral Satiety Sequence. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a restricted 20 g powdered food/day schedule. Food was presented at the same time during the lights on period dosed with either saline or the \ntest compound\n 2 hours before presentation of food and the start of observation. Pre-weighed bowls (containing 20 g of food) were presented and the behavior of the rats was observed for 1 hour. Behavioral observations were divided into 3 categories: Feeding, Active (includes grooming, drinking and sniffing/exploration), and Resting (decreased activity and sleep). The amount of time spent in each behavior was recorded. The amount of food intake was determined after the observation period.\n\n\nConditioned Taste Avoidance. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were adapted to a restricted drinking period of 30 minutes/day during lights on and were provided with pelleted chow ad libitum. In laboratory animals, administration of LiCl conditions an aversion to the novel and favorable taste of saccharin (Seeley R J, Blake K, Rushing P A, Benoit S, Eng J, Woods S C and D'Alessio D: The role of CNS glucagons-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide receptors in mediating the visceral illness effects of lithium chloride. \nJ. Neurosci. \n20(4):1616-1621, 2000). To condition animals, an injection of LiCl or test compound was administered immediately after the initial presentation of a 0.1% solution of saccharin. Two days later, saccharin solution was again presented and fluid intake was determined. A decrease in drinking the saccharin solution suggests development of a conditioned taste aversion.\n\n\nDetermination of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The mass values were determined using a Waters MicroMass ZQ device utilizing a positive mode. Mass determinations were compared with calculated values and expressed in the form of mass weight plus one (M+1 or M+H).\n\n\nProton NMR data was obtained using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were obtained after dissolving compounds in a deuterated solvent such as chloroform, DMSO, or methanol as appropriate.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nN-{3-[1-[2(R)-Amino-3-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-propionyl]-6(R)-methyl-4-(2-naphthalen-2-yl-ethyl)-piperazin-2(S)-yl]-propyl}-guanidine\n\n\nThe following compound was synthesized by the method of \nScheme\n 3 using 2-naphthylacetic acid as J-COOH, (S)-(+)-1-amino-2-propanol as NH\n2\n—CH(R\n5\n)—CH(R\n4\n)—OH, Fmoc-L-Arg(Boc)\n2\n-OH as Prt-NH—C(R\n2\n)—COOH and Boc-D-2,4-dichloro-Phe-OH as Q-COOH.

No. 08/595,335, filed Feb. 1, 1996, now abandoned.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDescribed herein are methods for identifying and preparing high-affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands to Complement System Proteins. The method utilized herein for identifying such Nucleic Acid Ligands is called SELEX™, an acronym for Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment. Described herein are methods for identifying and preparing high-affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands to the Complement System Proteins C1q, C3 and C5. This invention includes high affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands of C1q, C3 and C5. Also disclosed are RNA ligands of C1q, C3 and C5. Also disclosed are Nucleic Acid Ligands that inhibit and/or activate the Complement System. The oligonucleotides of the present invention are useful as pharmaceuticals or diagnostic agents.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe complement system comprises a set of at least 20 plasma and membrane proteins that act together in a regulated cascade system to attack extracellular forms of pathogens (Janeway et al. (1994) \nImmunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease\n. Current Biology Ltd, San Francisco, pp. 8:35-8:55; Morgan (1995) Crit. Rev. in Clin Lab. Sci. 32(3):265-298). There are two distinct enzymatic activation cascades, the classical and alternative pathways, and a non-enzymatic pathway known as the membrane attack pathway.\n\n\nThe classical pathway is usually triggered by an antibody bound to a foreign particle. It comprises several components, C1, C4, C2, C3 and C5 (listed by order in the pathway). Initiation of the classical pathway of the Complement System occurs following binding and activation of the first complement component (C1) by both immune and non-immune activators (Cooper (1985) Adv. Immunol. 37:151). C1 comprises a calcium-dependent complex of components C1q, C1r and C1s, and is activated through binding of the C1q component. C1q contains six identical subunits and each subunit comprises three chains (the A, B and C chains). Each chain has a globular head region which is connected to a collagen-like tail. Binding and activation of C1q by antigen-antibody complexes occurs through the C1q head group region. Numerous non-antibody C1q activators, including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (Reid et al. (1993) \nThe Natural Immune System: Humoral Factors\n. E. Sim, ed. IRL Press, Oxford, p. 151) bind and activate through a distinct site on the collagen-like stalk region.\n\n\nNon-antibody C1q protein activators include C-reactive protein (CRP) (Jiang et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 146:2324) and serum amyloid protein (SAP) (Bristow et al. (1986) Mol. Immunol. 23:1045); these will activate C1q when aggregated by binding to phospholipid or carbohydrate, respectively. Monomeric CRP or SAP do not activate C1q. C1q is also activated through binding to aggregated β-amyloid peptide (Schultz et al. (1994) Neurosci. Lett. 175:99; Snyder et al. (1994) Exp. Neurol. 128:136), a component of plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease (Jiang et al. (1994) J. Immunol. 152:5050; Eikelenboom and Stam (1982) Acta Neuropathol (Berl) 57:239; Eikelenboom et al. (1989) Virchows Arch. [B] 56:259; Rogers et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10016; Dietzschold et al. (1995) J. Neurol. Sci. 130: 11). C1q activation might also exacerbate the tissue damage associated with Alzheimer's disease. These activators bind C1q on its collagen-like region, distant from the head-group region where immunoglobulin activators bind. Other proteins which bind the C1q collagen-like region include collagen (Menzel et al. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 670:265), fibronectin (Reid et al. (1984) Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. Sect. C 92 (Suppl. 284): 11), Iaminin (Bohnsack et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3824), fibrinogen and fibrin (Entwistle et al. (1988) Biochem. 27:507), HIV rsgp41 (Stoiber et al. (1995) Mol. Immunol. 32:371), actin (Nishioka et al. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108:1307) and tobacco glycoprotein (Koethe et al. (1995) J. Immunol. 155:826).\n\n\nC1q also binds and can be activated by anionic carbohydrates (Hughes-Jones et al. (1978) Immunology 34:459) including mucopolysaccharides (Almeda et al. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258:785), fucans (Blondin et al. (1994) Mol. Immunol. 31:247), proteoglycans (Silvestri et al. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256:7383), and by lipids including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Zohair et al. (1989) Biochem. J. 257:865; Stoiber et al. (1994) Eur. J. Immunol. 24:294). Both DNA (Schravendijk and Dwek (1982) Mol. Immunol. 19:1179; Rosenberg et al. (1988) J. Rheumatol 15:1091; Uwatoko et al. (1990) J. Immunol. 144:3484) and RNA (Acton et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:3530) can also bind and potentially activate C1q. Intracellular components which activate C1q include cellular and subcellular membranes (Linder (1981) J. Immunol. 126:648; Pinckard et al. (1973) J. Immunol. 110: 1376; Storrs et al. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256:10924; Giclas et al. (1979) J. Immunol. 122: 146; Storrs et al. (1983) J. Immunol. 131:416), intermediate filaments (Linder et al. (1979) Nature 278:176) and actin (Nishioka et al. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108:1307). All of these interactions would recruit the classical pathway for protection against bacterial (or viral) infection, or as a response to tissue injury (Li et al. (1994) J. Immunol. 152:2995) in the absence of antibody.\n\n\nA binding site for non-antibody activators including CRP (Jiang et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 146:2324), SAP (Ying et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 150:169), β-amyloid peptide (Newman (1994) Curr. Biol. 4:462) and DNA (Jiang et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267:25597) has been localized to the amino terminus of C1q A chain at residues 14-26. A synthetic peptide comprising this sequence effectively inhibits both binding and activation. The peptide 14-26 contains several basic residues and matches one of the heparin binding motifs (Yabkowitz et al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264:10888; Cardin et al. (1989) Arteriosclerosis 9:21). The peptide is also highly homologous with peptide 145-156 in collagen-tailed acetylcholinesterase; this site is associated with heparin-sulfate basement membrane binding (Deprez et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270:11043). A second C1q A chain site at residues 76-92 also might be involved in weaker binding; this site is at the junction of the globular head region and the collagen-like tail.\n\n\nThe second enzymatically activated cascade, known as the alternative pathway, is a rapid, antibody-independent route for the Complement System activation and amplification. The alternative pathway comprises several components, C3, Factor B, and Factor D. Activation of the alternative pathway occurs when C3b, a proteolytic cleavage form of C3, is bound to an activating surface such as a bacterium. Factor B is then bound to C3b, and cleaved by Factor D to yield the active enzyme, Ba. The enzyme Ba then cleaves more C3 to C3b, producing extensive deposition of C3b-Ba complexes on the activating surface. When a second C3b is deposited, forming a C3b-C3b-Ba complex, the enzyme can then cleave C5 and trigger activation of the terminal pathway.\n\n\nThe non-enzymatic terminal pathway, also known as the membrane attack pathway, comprises the components C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9. Activation of this membrane attack pathway results when the C5 component is enzymatically cleaved by either the classical or alternative pathway to yield the small C5a polypeptide (9 kDa) and the large C5b fragment (200 kDa). The C5a polypeptide binds to a 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor which was originally described on leukocytes and is now known to be expressed on a variety of tissues including hepatocytes (Haviland et al. (1995) J. Immunol. 154:1861) and neurons (Gasque et al. (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 150:31). The C5a molecule is the primary chemotactic component of the human Complement System and can trigger a variety of biological responses including leukocyte chemotaxis, smooth muscle contraction, activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways, neutrophil-endothelial adhesion (Mulligan et al. (1997) J. Immunol. 158:1857), cytokine and lipid mediator release and oxidant formation. The larger C5b fragment binds sequentially to later components to form the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC). The C5b-9 MAC can directly lyse erythrocytes, and in greater quantities is lytic for leukocytes and is damaging to tissues such as muscle, epithelial and endothelial cells (Stahl et al. (1997) Circ. Res. 76:575). In sublytic amounts the MAC can stimulate upregulation of adhesion molecules, intracellular calcium increase and cytokine release (Ward (1996) Am. J. Pathol. 149:1079). In addition, the C5b-9 MAC can stimulate cells such as endothelial cells and platelets without causing cell lysis. The non-lytic effects of C5a and the C5b-9 MAC are sometimes quite similar.\n\n\nThe Complement System has an important role in defense against bacterial and viral infection, and possibly in immune surveillance against tumors. This is demonstrated most clearly in humans who are deficient in complement components. Individuals deficient in early components (C1, C4, C2 or C3) suffer from recurrent infections, while individuals deficient in late components (C5 through C9) are susceptible to nisseria infection. Complement classical pathway is activated on bacteria by antibodies, by binding of CRP or SAP, or by direct activation through LPS. Complement alternative pathway is activated through binding of C3 to the cell coat. Complement can be activated by viruses through antibodies, and can also be activated on viral infected cells because these are recognized as foreign. In a similar way, transformed cells can be recognized as foreign and can be lysed by the Complement System or targeted for immune clearance.\n\n\nActivation of the Complement System can and has been used for therapeutic purposes. Antibodies which were produced against tumor cells were then used to activate the Complement System and cause tumor rejection. Also, the Complement System is used together with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to eliminate unwanted lymphocytes. For example, anti-lymphocyte globulin or monoclonal anti-T-cell antibodies are used prior to organ transplantation to eliminate lymphocytes which would otherwise mediate rejection.\n\n\nAlthough the Complement System has an important role in the maintenance of health, it has the potential to cause or contribute to disease. The Complement System has been implicated in numerous renal, rheumatological, neurological, dermatological, hematological, vascular/pulmonary, allergy, infectious, biocompatibility/shock and other diseases or conditions (Morgan (1995) Crit. Rev. in Clin Lab. Sci. 32(3):265-298; Matis and Rollins (1995) Nature Medicine 1(8):839-842). The Complement System is not necessarily the only cause of the disease state, but it may be one of several factors, each of which contributes to pathogenesis.\n\n\nSeveral pharmaceuticals have been developed that inhibit the Complement System in vivo, however, many cause toxicity or are poor inhibitors (Morgan (1995) Crit. Rev. in Clin Lab. Sci. 32(3):265-298). Heparins, K76COOH and nafamstat mesilate have been shown to be effective in animal studies (Morgan (1995) Crit. Rev. in Clin Lab. Sci. 32(3):265-298). Recombinant forms of naturally occurring inhibitors of the Complement System have been developed or are under consideration, and these include the membrane regulatory proteins Complement Receptor 1 (CR1), Decay Accelerating Factor (DAF), Membrane Cofactor Protein (MCP) and CD59.\n\n\nC5 is an attractive target for the development of a Complement System inhibitor, as both the classical and alternative pathways converge at component C5 (Matis and Rollins (1995) Nature Medicine 1(8):839-842). In addition, inhibition of C5 cleavage blocks both the C5a and the C5b effects on leukocytes and on tissue such as endothelial cells (Ward (1996) Am. J. Pathol. 149:1079); thus C5 inhibition can have therapeutic benefits in a variety of diseases and situations, including lung inflammation (Mulligan et al. (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 98:503), extracorporeal complement activation (Rinder et al. (1995) J. Clin. Invest. 96:1564) or antibody-mediated complement activation (Biesecker et al. (1989) J. Immunol. 142:2654). Matis and Rollins ((1995) Nature Medicine 1(8):839-842) have developed C5-specific monoclonal antibodies as an anti-inflammatory biopharmaceutical. Both C5a and the MAC have been implicated in acute and chronic inflammation associated with human disease, and their role in disease states has been confirmed in animal models. C5a is required for complement- and neutrophil-dependent lung vascular injury (Ward (1997) J. Lab. Clin. Med. 129:400; Mulligan et al. (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 98:503), and is associated with neutrophil and platelet activation in shock and in burn injury (Schmid et al. (1997) Shock 8:119). The MAC mediates muscle injury in acute autoimmune myasthenia gravis (Biesecker and Gomez (1989) J. Immunol. 142:2654), organ rejection in transplantation (Baldwin et al. (1995) Transplantation 59:797; Brauer et al. (1995) Transplantation 59:288; Takahashi et al. (1997) Immunol. Res. 16:273) and renal injury in autoimmune glomerulonephritis (Biesecker (1981) J. Exp. Med. 39:1779; Nangaku (1997) Kidney Int. 52:1570). Both C5a and the MAC are implicated in acute myocardial ischemia (Homeister and Lucchesi (1994) Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 34:17), acute (Bednar et al. (1997) J. Neurosurg. 86:139) and chronic CNS injury (Morgan (1997) Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 14:19), leukocyte activation during extracorporeal circulation (Sun et al. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23:2909; Spycher and Nydegger (1995) Infushionsther. Transfusionsmed. 22:36) and in tissue injury associated with autoimmune diseases including arthritis and lupus (Wang et al. (1996) Immunology 93:8563). Thus, inhibiting cleavage of C5 prevents generation of two potentially damaging activities of the Complement System. Inhibiting C5a release eliminates the major Complement System chemotactic and vasoactive activity, and inhibiting C5b formation blocks assembly of the cytolytic C5b-9 MAC. Furthermore, inhibition of C5 prevents injury by the Complement System while leaving intact important Complement System defense and clearance mechanisms, such as C3 and C1q phagocytic activity, clearance of immune complexes and the innate immune response (Carrol (1998) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 16:545).\n\n\nC3 is an attractive target for the development of a Complement System inhibitor, as it is common to both pathways. Inhibition of C3 using recombinant versions of a natural inhibitors (Kalli et al. (1994) Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 15:417) can prevent cell-mediated tissue injury (Mulligan et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148:1479) and this has been shown to have therapeutic benefit in diseases such as myocardial infarction (Weisman et al. (1990) Science 249:146) and liver ischemia/reperfusion (Chavez-Cartaya et al. (1995) Transplantation 59:1047). Controlling C3 limits most biological activities of the Complement System. Most natural inhibitors, including DAF, MCP, CR1 and Factor H target C3.\n\n\nSELEX™\n\n\nA method for the in vitro evolution of Nucleic Acid molecules with highly specific binding to target molecules has been developed. This method, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, termed the SELEX process, is described in U.S. patent application Ser.

Each of these applications, collectively referred to herein as the SELEX Patent Applications, describes a fundamentally novel method for making a Nucleic Acid Ligand to any desired Target molecule.\n\n\nThe SELEX method involves selection from a mixture of candidate oligonucleotides and step-wise iterations of binding, partitioning and amplification, using the same general selection scheme, to achieve virtually any desired criterion of binding affinity and selectivity. Starting from a mixture of Nucleic Acids, preferably comprising a segment of randomized sequence, the SELEX method includes steps of contacting the mixture with the Target under conditions favorable for binding, partitioning unbound Nucleic Acids from those Nucleic Acids which have bound specifically to Target molecules, dissociating the Nucleic Acid-Target complexes, amplifying the Nucleic Acids dissociated from the Nucleic Acid-Target complexes to yield a ligand-enriched mixture of Nucleic Acids, then reiterating the steps of binding, partitioning, dissociating and amplifying through as many cycles as desired to yield highly specific, high affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands to the Target molecule.\n\n\nThe basic SELEX method has been modified to achieve a number of specific objectives.

Examples of such modifications include chemical substitutions at the ribose and/or phosphate and/or base positions. SELEX-identified Nucleic Acid Ligands containing modified nucleotides are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/117,991, filed Sep. 8, 1993, entitled “High Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands Containing Modified Nucleotides,” now abandoned, (see also U.S. Pat.

As stated earlier, the SELEX technology is described in detail in the SELEX Patent Applications which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Certain terms used to describe the invention herein are defined as follows:\n\n\n“Nucleic Acid Ligand” as used herein is a non-naturally occurring Nucleic Acid having a desirable action on a Target. A desirable action includes, but is not limited to, binding of the Target, catalytically changing the Target, reacting with the Target in a way which modifies/alters the Target or the functional activity of the Target, covalently attaching to the Target as in a suicide inhibitor, and facilitating the reaction between the Target and another molecule. In the preferred embodiment, the desirable action is specific binding to a Target molecule, such Target molecule being a three dimensional chemical structure other than a polynucleotide that binds to the Nucleic Acid Ligand through a mechanism which predominantly depends on Watson/Crick base pairing or triple helix binding, wherein the Nucleic Acid Ligand is not a Nucleic Acid having the known physiological function of being bound by the Target molecule. Nucleic Acid Ligands include Nucleic Acids that are identified from a Candidate Mixture of Nucleic Acids, said Nucleic Acid Ligand being a ligand of a given Target by the method comprising: a) contacting the Candidate Mixture with the Target, wherein Nucleic Acids having an increased affinity to the Target relative to the Candidate Mixture may be partitioned from the remainder of the Candidate Mixture; b) partitioning the increased affinity Nucleic Acids from the remainder of the Candidate Mixture; and c) amplifying the increased affinity Nucleic Acids to yield a ligand-enriched mixture of Nucleic Acids.\n\n\n“Candidate Mixture” is a mixture of Nucleic Acids of differing sequence from which to select a desired ligand. The source of a Candidate Mixture can be from naturally-occurring Nucleic Acids or fragments thereof, chemically synthesized Nucleic Acids, enzymatically synthesized Nucleic Acids or Nucleic Acids made by a combination of the foregoing techniques. In a preferred embodiment, each Nucleic Acid has fixed sequences surrounding a randomized region to facilitate the amplification process. “Nucleic Acid” means both DNA, RNA, single-stranded or double-stranded and any chemical modifications thereof. Modifications include, but are not limited to, those which provide other chemical groups that incorporate additional charge, polarizability, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and fluxionality to the Nucleic Acid Ligand bases or to the Nucleic Acid Ligand as a whole. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, 2′-position sugar modifications, 5-position pyrimidine modifications, 8-position purine modifications, modifications at exocyclic amines, substitution of 4-thiouridine, substitution of 5-bromo or 5-iodo-uracil, backbone modifications, methylations, unusual base-pairing combinations such as the isobases isocytidine and isoguanidine and the like. Modifications can also include 3′ and 5′ modifications such as capping.\n\n\n“SELEX™” methodology involves the combination of selection of Nucleic Acid Ligands which interact with a Target in a desirable manner, for example binding to a protein, with amplification of those selected Nucleic Acids. Iterative cycling of the selection/amplification steps allows selection of one or a small number of Nucleic Acids which interact most strongly with the Target from a pool which contains a very large number of Nucleic Acids. Cycling of the selection/amplification procedure is continued until a selected goal is achieved. In the present invention, the SELEX methodology is employed to obtain Nucleic Acid Ligands to C1q, C3 and C5. The SELEX methodology is described in the SELEX Patent Applications.\n\n\n“Target” means any compound or molecule of interest for which a ligand is desired. A Target can be a protein, peptide, carbohydrate, polysaccharide, glycoprotein, hormone, receptor, antigen, antibody, virus, substrate, metabolite, transition state analog, cofactor, inhibitor, drug, dye, nutrient, growth factor, etc. without limitation. In this application, the Target is a Complement System Protein, preferably C1q, C3 and C5.\n\n\n“Complement System Protein” means any protein or component of the Complement System including, but not limited to, C1, C1q, C1r, C1s, C2, C3, C3a, C3b, C4, C4a, C5, C5a, C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9, Factor B (B), Factor D (D), Factor H (H) and receptors thereof, and other soluble and membrane inhibitors/control proteins.\n\n\n“Complement System” is a set of plasma and membrane proteins that act together in a regulated cascade system to attack extracellular forms of pathogens or infected or transformed cells, and in clearance of immune reactants or cellular debris. The Complement System can be activated spontaneously on certain pathogens or by antibody binding to the pathogen. The pathogen becomes coated with Complement System Proteins (opsonized) for uptake and destruction. The pathogen can also be directly lysed and killed. Similar mechanisms target infected, transformed or damaged cells. The Complement System also participates in clearance of immune and cellular debris.\n\n\nThe SELEX process is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/536,428, filed Jun. 11, 1990, entitled “Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment,” now abandoned; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/714,131, filed Jun. 10, 1991, entitled “Nucleic Acid Ligands,” now U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,096; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/931,473, filed Aug. 17, 1992, entitled “Methods for Identifying Nucleic Acid Ligands,” now U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,163 (see also WO 91/19813). These applications, each specifically incorporated herein by reference, are collectively called the SELEX Patent Applications.\n\n\nIn its most basic form, the SELEX process may be defined by the following series of steps:\n\n\n1) A Candidate Mixture of Nucleic Acids of differing sequence is prepared. The Candidate Mixture generally includes regions of fixed sequences (i.e., each of the members of the Candidate Mixture contains the same sequences in the same location) and regions of randomized sequences. The fixed sequence regions are selected either: (a) to assist in the amplification steps described below, (b) to mimic a sequence known to bind to the Target, or (c) to enhance the concentration of a given structural arrangement of the Nucleic Acids in the Candidate Mixture. The randomized sequences can be totally randomized (i.e., the probability of finding a base at any position being one in four) or only partially randomized (e.g., the probability of finding a base at any location can be selected at any level between 0 and 100 percent).\n\n\n2) The Candidate Mixture is contacted with the selected Target under conditions favorable for binding between the Target and members of the Candidate Mixture. Under these circumstances, the interaction between the Target and the Nucleic Acids of the Candidate Mixture can be considered as forming Nucleic Acid-Target pairs between the Target and those Nucleic Acids having the strongest affinity for the Target.\n\n\n3) The Nucleic Acids with the highest affinity for the Target are partitioned from those Nucleic Acids with lesser affinity to the Target. Because only an extremely small number of sequences (and possibly only one molecule of Nucleic Acid) corresponding to the highest affinity Nucleic Acids exist in the Candidate Mixture, it is generally desirable to set the partitioning criteria so that a significant amount of the Nucleic Acids in the Candidate Mixture (approximately 5-50%) are retained during partitioning.\n\n\n4) Those Nucleic Acids selected during partitioning as having the relatively higher affinity to the Target are then amplified to create a new Candidate Mixture that is enriched in Nucleic Acids having a relatively higher affinity for the Target.\n\n\n5) By repeating the partitioning and amplifying steps above, the newly formed Candidate Mixture contains fewer and fewer weakly binding sequences, and the average degree of affinity of the Nucleic Acids to the Target will generally increase. Taken to its extreme, the SELEX process will yield a Candidate Mixture containing one or a small number of unique Nucleic Acids representing those Nucleic Acids from the original Candidate Mixture having the highest affinity to the Target molecule.\n\n\nThe SELEX Patent Applications describe and elaborate on this process in great detail. Included are Targets that can be used in the process; methods for partitioning Nucleic Acids within a Candidate Mixture; and methods for amplifying partitioned Nucleic Acids to generate enriched Candidate Mixture. The SELEX Patent Applications also describe ligands obtained to a number of target species, including both protein Targets where the protein is and is not a Nucleic Acid binding protein.\n\n\nThe SELEX method further encompasses combining selected Nucleic Acid Ligands with lipophilic or Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compounds in a diagnostic or therapeutic complex as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/434,465, filed May 4, 1995, entitled “Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes,” now U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,020. VEGF Nucleic Acid Ligands that are associated with a Lipophilic Compound, such as diacyl glycerol or dialkyl glycerol, in a diagnostic or therapeutic complex are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/739,109, filed Oct. 25, 1996, entitled “Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes,” now U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,228. VEGF Nucleic Acid Ligands that are associated with a Lipophilic Compound, such as a glycerol lipid, or a Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight Compound, such as polyalkylene glycol, are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/897,351, filed Jul. 21, 1997, entitled “Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes,” now U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,698. VEGF Nucleic Acid Ligands that are associated with a Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound or a lipophilic compound are also further described in PCT/US97/18944, filed Oct. 17, 1997, entitled “Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes.” Each of the above described patent applications which describe modifications of the basic SELEX procedure are specifically incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\nCertain embodiments of the present invention provide a complex comprising one or more Nucleic Acid Ligands to a Complement System Protein covalently linked with a Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound or lipophilic compound. A complex as used herein describes the molecular entity formed by the covalent linking of the Nucleic Acid Ligand of a Complement System Protein to a Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound. A Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound is a compound between approximately 100 Da to 1,000,000 Da, more preferably approximately 1000 Da to 500,000 Da, and most preferably approximately 1000 Da to 200,000 Da, that typically does not generate an immunogenic response. For the purposes of this invention, an immunogenic response is one that causes the organism to make antibody proteins. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound is a polyalkylene glycol. In the most preferred embodiment, the polyalkylene glycol is polyethylene glycol (PEG). More preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 10-80K. Most preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 20-45K. In certain embodiments of the invention, the Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound can also be a Nucleic Acid Ligand.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention is directed to complexes comprised of a Nucleic Acid Ligand to a Complement System Protein and a lipophilic compound. Lipophilic compounds are compounds that have the propensity to associate with or partition into lipid and/or other materials or phases with low dielectric constants, including structures that are comprised substantially of lipophilic components. Lipophilic compounds include lipids as well as non-lipid containing compounds that have the propensity to associate with lipids (and/or other materials or phases with low dielectric constants). Cholesterol, phospholipid, and glycerol lipids, such as dialkyl glycerol, diacyl glycerol, and glycerol amide lipids are further examples of lipophilic compounds. In a preferred embodiment, the lipophilic compound is a glycerol lipid.\n\n\nThe Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound or lipophilic compound may be covalently bound to a variety of positions on the Nucleic Acid Ligand to a Complement System Protein, such as to an exocyclic amino group on the base, the 5-position of a pyrimidine nucleotide, the 8-position of a purine nucleotide, the hydroxyl group of the phosphate, or a hydroxyl group or other group at the 5′ or 3′ terminus of the Nucleic Acid Ligand to a Complement System Protein. In embodiments where the lipophilic compound is a glycerol lipid, or the Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound is polyalkylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, preferably the Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound is bonded to the 5′ or 3′ hydroxyl of the phosphate group thereof. In the most preferred embodiment, the lipophilic compound or Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound is bonded to the 5′ hydroxyl of the phosphate group of the Nucleic Acid Ligand. Attachment of the Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound or lipophilic compound to the Nucleic Acid Ligand of the Complement System Protein can be done directly or with the utilization of linkers or spacers.\n\n\nA linker is a molecular entity that connects two or more molecular entities through covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions, and can allow spatial separation of the molecular entities in a manner that preserves the functional properties of one or more of the molecular entities. A linker can also be referred to as a spacer.\n\n\nThe complex comprising a Nucleic Acid Ligand to a Complement System Protein and a Non-Immunogenic, High Molecular Weight compound or lipophilic compound can be further associated with a lipid construct. Lipid constructs are structures containing lipids, phospholipids, or derivatives thereof comprising a variety of different structural arrangements which lipids are known to adopt in aqueous suspension. These structures include, but are not limited to, lipid bilayer vesicles, micelles, liposomes, emulsions, lipid ribbons or sheets, and may be complexed with a variety of drugs and components which are known to be pharmaceutically acceptable. In a preferred embodiment, the lipid construct is a liposome. The preferred liposome is unilamellar and has a relative size less than 200 nm. Common additional components in lipid constructs include cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol, among others. The lipid constructs may be used alone or in any combination which one skilled in the art would appreciate to provide the characteristics desired for a particular application. In addition, the technical aspects of lipid constructs and liposome formation are well known in the art and any of the methods commonly practiced in the field may be used for the present invention.\n\n\nThe methods described herein and the Nucleic Acid Ligands identified by such methods are useful for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Therapeutic uses include the treatment or prevention of diseases or medical conditions in human patients, specifically diseases or conditions caused by activation of the Complement System. The Complement System does not have to be the only cause of the disease state, but it may be one of several factors, each of which contributes to pathogenesis. Such diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to, renal diseases, such as lupus nephritis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), membranous nephritis, IgA nephropathy; rheumatological diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Behcet's syndrome, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and systemic sclerosis; neurological diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral lupus, Guillain-Barre syndrome and Alzheimer's disease; dermatological diseases, such as Pemphigus/pemphigoid, phototoxic reactions, vasculitis and thermal burns; hematological diseases, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with positive acidified serum lysis test (HEMPAS) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); biocompatibility/shock diseases, such as post-bypass syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), catheter reactions, anaphylaxis, transplant rejection, pre-eclampsia, hemodialysis and platelet storage; vascular/pulmonary diseases, such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke and reperfusion injury; allergies, such as anaphylaxis, asthma and skin reactions; infection, such as septic shock, viral infection and bacterial infection; and other conditions, such as atheroma, bowel inflammation, thyroiditis, infertility, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and hemolytic anemia.\n\n\nThe Complement System can be inhibited at several points in the activation cascade by targeting different components. Inhibition of C1q would block the initiation by either antibody or non-antibody mechanisms. Antibodies activate C1q in many diseases including SLE, myasthenia gravis and arthritis. Non-antibody Complement System activation occurs in many diseases including Alzheimer's disease, myocardial infarction and septic shock. Blocking C1q could prevent the complement-mediated tissue injury in these diseases.\n\n\nThe Complement can also be activated in the absence of antibodies directly at the C3 stage. Activating surfaces including bacteria, virus particles or damaged cells can trigger Complement System activation that does not require C1q. An inhibitor of C3 could prevent Complement System activation and damage in these situations.\n\n\nIn other instances the inhibition of C5 is most useful. Activation of the Complement System by either C1q or C3 mechanisms both lead to activation of C5, so that inhibition of C5 could prevent Complement System-mediated damage by either pathway. However, both C1q and C3 are important in normal defense against microorganisms and in clearance of immune components and damaged tissue, while C5 is mostly dispensable for this function. Therefore, C5 can be inhibited either for a short term or a long term and the protective role of Complement System would not be compromised, whereas long term inhibition of C1q or C3 is not desirable. Finally, the C5 fragments C5a and C5b directly cause the majority of tissue injury and disease associated with unwanted Complement System activation. Therefore, inhibition of C5 is the most direct way of producing therapeutic benefit.\n\n\nIn other instances, the activation of the Complement System is desirable in the treatment or prevention of diseases or medical conditions in human patients. For example, the activation of the Complement System is desirable in treating bacterial or viral infections and malignancies. In addition, the activation of the Complement System on T-cells prior to transplantation could prevent rejection of an organ or tissue by eliminating the T-cells that mediate the rejection.\n\n\nFurthermore, Nucleic Acid Ligands that bind to cell surface Targets could be made more efficient by giving them the ability to activate the Complement System. Nucleic Acid binding would then both inhibit a Target function and also eliminate the cell, for example, by membrane attack complex lysis and cell clearance through opsonization. Nucleic Acid Ligands could activate the Complement System through either the classical or the alternative pathways. C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands can be conjugated to other structures that target a cell surface component. For example, C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands can be conjugated to antibodies to cell targets, cytokines, growth factors or a ligand to a cell receptor. This would allow the C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands to multimerize on the targeted cell surface and activate the Complement System, thereby killing the cell.\n\n\nThe prototype classical pathway activators are immune aggregates, which activate the Complement System through binding to globular head groups on the C1q component. Generally, binding of two or more Fc domains to C1q is required; pentameric IgM is an especially efficient activator. In contrast, Nucleic Acid Ligands can activate through binding at a separate site on the C1q collagen-like tail region. This site also binds to a variety of other non-antibody activators including C-reactive protein, serum amyloid protein, endotoxin, β-amyloid peptide 1-40 and mitochondrial membranes. As with immunoglobulin, these non-antibody activators need to be multimerized to activate.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligands that bind to sites on the collagen-like region of C1q may also become activators when aggregated. Such a Complement System-activating aggregate may be lytic if formed on a cell surface, such as binding to a tumor-specific antigen (TSA) or to a leukocyte antigen. The extent of Nucleic Acid Ligand-mediated activation increases with the extent of Nucleic Acid Ligand aggregation (i.e., multiplicity of Nucleic Acid Ligand-C1q interaction). The Complement System-mediated killing is especially specific if the Nucleic Acid Ligands circulate as monomers which do not activate, but become activators when they are multimerized on the targeted cell surface.\n\n\nAs with any Complement System activation, the extent and specificity is determined by the amount of C3 deposited onto the targeted cell. Deposited C3 forms an enzyme convertase that cleaves C5 and initiates membrane attack complex formation. C3 is also the classical serum opsonin for targeting phagocytic ingestion. The prototype alternative pathway activators are repeating carbohydrate units including bacterial and yeast cell walls, fucoidin and Sepharose, or glycolipids such as endotoxin or the glycocalyx. Nucleic Acid Ligands could activate the alternative pathway by aggregating the C3 component on the cell surface. Depositing C3 on a cell promotes Factor B binding and alternative pathway C3 convertase formation. Binding of a Nucleic Acid Ligand to C3 blocks binding of the inhibitor Factor H and prevents C3b decay. This would also increase C3 convertase formation and alternative path activation. Nucleic Acid Ligands to C3 may have this activity since heparin binds activated C3 and can promote alternative pathway activation. Binding of Nucleic Acid Ligands to C3 blocks binding to C3 of the membrane-associated inhibitors CR1, CR2, MCP and DAF, preventing C3b convertase decay and stimulating alternative pathway activation. This alternative pathway mechanism can be as efficient as C1q-dependent activation in cell killing and lysis.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligand-mediated Complement System cell killing could be employed in several ways, for example, by: a) direct killing of tumor cells; b) lysis of targeted microorganisms or infected cells; and c) elimination of lymphocytes or lymphocyte subsets. Nucleic Acid Ligands could replace antibodies currently used for these purposes.\n\n\nDiagnostic utilization may include either in vivo or in vitro diagnostic applications. The SELEX method generally, and the specific adaptations of the SELEX method taught and claimed herein specifically, are particularly suited for diagnostic applications. The SELEX method identifies Nucleic Acid Ligands that are able to bind targets with high affinity and with surprising specificity. These characteristics are, of course, the desired properties one skilled in the art would seek in a diagnostic ligand.\n\n\nThe Nucleic Acid Ligands of the present invention may be routinely adapted for diagnostic purposes according to any number of techniques employed by those skilled in the art. Diagnostic agents need only be able to allow the user to identify the presence of a given target at a particular locale or concentration. Simply the ability to form binding pairs with the target may be sufficient to trigger a positive signal for diagnostic purposes. Those skilled in the art would also be able to adapt any Nucleic Acid Ligand by procedures known in the art to incorporate a labeling tag in order to track the presence of such ligand. Such a tag could be used in a number of diagnostic procedures. The Nucleic Acid Ligands to C1q, C3 and C5 described herein may specifically be used for identification of the C1q, C3 or C5 protein.\n\n\nThe SELEX process provides high affinity ligands of a target molecule. This represents a singular achievement that is unprecedented in the field of Nucleic Acids research. The present invention applies the SELEX procedure to the specific target C1q, which is part of the first component (C1) of the classical pathway of Complement System activation, to the specific target C3, which is part of both the classical and alternative pathway, and to the specific target C5, which is part of the terminal pathway. In the Example section below, the experimental parameters used to isolate and identify the Nucleic Acid Ligands to C1q, C3 and C5 are described.\n\n\nIn order to produce Nucleic Acids desirable for use as a pharmaceutical, it is preferred that the Nucleic Acid Ligand (1) binds to the target in a manner capable of achieving the desired effect on the target; (2) be as small as possible to obtain the desired effect; (3) be as stable as possible; and (4) be a specific ligand to the chosen target. In most situations, it is preferred that the Nucleic Acid Ligand have the highest possible affinity to the Target.\n\n\nPharmaceutical agents, which include, but are not limited to, small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, nucleosides, and polypeptides can activate the Complement System in an undesirable manner. Nucleic Acid Ligands to Complement System Proteins could be used as a prophylactic by transiently inhibiting the Complement System, so that a pharmaceutical agent could be administered and achieve a therapeutically effective amount without eliciting the undesirable side effect of activating the Complement System.\n\n\nIn co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/964,624, filed Oct. 21, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,938, (the '938 Patent), methods are described for obtaining improved Nucleic Acid Ligands after SELEX has been performed. The '938 Patent, entitled “Nucleic Acid Ligands to HIV-RT and HIV-1 Rev,” is specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nIn the present invention, SELEX experiments were performed in order to identify RNA with specific high affinity for C1q, C3 and C5 from a degenerate library containing 30 or 50 random positions (30N or 50N). This invention includes the specific RNA ligands to C1q shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NOS:5-20) and Table 6 (SEQ ID NOS:84-155), identified by the method described in Examples 2 and 6, the specific RNA ligands to C3 shown in Table 3 (SEQ ID NOS:21-46), identified by method described in Example 3, and the specific RNA ligands to C5 shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS:47-74), Table 5 (SEQ ID NOS:76-83), Table 8 (SEQ ID NOS:75, 160-162), Table 10 (SEQ ID NOS:163-189), Table 12 (SEQ ID NOS:190-192), Table 13 (SEQ ID NOS:194-196) and \nFIGS. 5A-B\n (SEQ ID NOS:160 and 193) identified by methods described in Examples 4, 9, 10 and 1. This invention further includes RNA ligands to C1q, C3 and C5 which inhibit the function of C1q, C3 and C5. The scope of the ligands covered by this invention extends to all Nucleic Acid Ligands of C1q, C3 and C5, modified and unmodified, identified according to the SELEX procedure. More specifically, this invention includes Nucleic Acid sequences that are substantially homologous to the ligands shown in Tables 2-6, 8, 10 and 12-13 and \nFIGS. 5A-B\n (SEQ ID NOS:5-155 and 160-196). By substantially homologous, it is meant a degree of primary sequence homology in excess of 70%, most preferably in excess of 80%, and even more preferably in excess of 90%, 95% or 99%. The percentage of homology as described herein is calculated as the percentage of nucleotides found in the smaller of the two sequences which align with identical nucleotide residues in the sequence being compared when 1 gap in a length of 10 nucleotides may be introduced to assist in that alignment. A review of the sequence homologies of the ligands of C1q shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NOS:5-20) and Table 6 (SEQ ID NOS:84-155) shows that sequences with little or no primary homology may have substantially the same ability to bind C1q. Similarly, a review of the sequence homologies of the ligands of C3 shown in Table 3 (SEQ ID NOS:21-46) shows that sequences with little or no primary homology may have substantially the same ability to bind C3. Similarly, a review of the sequence homologies of the ligands of C5 shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS:47-74), Table 5 (SEQ ID NOS:76-83), Table 8 (SEQ ID NOS:75, 160-162), Table 10 (SEQ ID NOS:163-189), Table 12 (SEQ ID NOS:190-192), Table 13 (SEQ ID NOS:194-196) and \nFIGS. 5A-B\n (SEQ ID NOS:160 and 193) shows that sequences with little or no primary homology may have substantially the same ability to bind C5. For these reasons, this invention also includes Nucleic Acid Ligands that have substantially the same structure and ability to bind C1q as the Nucleic Acid Ligands shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NOS:5-20) and Table 6 (SEQ ID NOS:84-155), Nucleic Acid Ligands that have substantially the same structure and ability to bind C3 as the Nucleic Acid Ligands shown in Table 3 (SEQ ID NOS:21-46) and Nucleic Acid Ligands that have substantially the same structure and ability to bind C5 as the Nucleic Acid Ligands shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS:47-74), Table 5 (SEQ ID NOS:76-83), Table 8 (SEQ ID NOS:75, 160-162), Table 10 (SEQ ID NOS:163-189), Table 12 (SEQ ID NOS:190-192), Table 13 (SEQ ID NOS:194-196) and \nFIGS. 5A-B\n (SEQ ID NOS:160 and 193). Substantially the same ability to bind C1q, C3 or C5 means that the affinity is within one or two orders of magnitude of the affinity of the ligands described herein. It is well within the skill of those of ordinary skill in the art to determine whether a given sequence—substantially homologous to those specifically described herein—has substantially the same ability to bind C1q, C3 or C5.\n\n\nThe invention also includes Nucleic Acid Ligands that have substantially the same postulated structure or structural motifs. Substantially the same structure or structural motifs can be postulated by sequence alignment using the Zukerfold program (see Zucker (1989) Science 244:48-52). As would be known in the art, other computer programs can be used for predicting secondary structure and structural motifs. Substantially the same structure or structural motif of Nucleic Acid Ligands in solution or as a bound structure can also be postulated using NMR or other techniques as would be known in the art.\n\n\nOne potential problem encountered in the therapeutic, prophylactic and in vivo diagnostic use of Nucleic Acids is that oligonucleotides in their phosphodiester form may be quickly degraded in body fluids by intracellular and extracellular enzymes such as endonucleases and exonucleases before the desired effect is manifest. Certain chemical modifications of the Nucleic Acid Ligand can be made to increase the in vivo stability of the Nucleic Acid Ligand or to enhance or to mediate the delivery of the Nucleic Acid Ligand. See, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/117,991, filed Sep. 8, 1993, entitled “High Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands Containing Modified Nucleotides,” now abandoned (see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,985) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/434,465, filed May 4, 1995, entitled “Nucleic Acid Ligand Complexes,” which are specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Modifications of the Nucleic Acid Ligands contemplated in this invention include, but are not limited to, those which provide other chemical groups that incorporate additional charge, polarizability, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and fluxionality to the Nucleic Acid Ligand bases or to the Nucleic Acid Ligand as a whole. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, 2′-position sugar modifications, 5-position pyrimidine modifications, 8-position purine modifications, modifications at exocyclic amines, substitution of 4-thiouridine, substitution of 5-bromo or 5-iodo-uracil, backbone modifications, phosphorothioate or alkyl phosphate modifications, methylations, unusual base-pairing combinations such as the isobases isocytidine and isoguanidine and the like. Modifications can also include 3′ and 5′ modifications such as capping.\n\n\nWhere the Nucleic Acid Ligands are derived by the SELEX method, the modifications can be pre- or post-SELEX modifications. Pre-SELEX modifications yield Nucleic Acid Ligands with both specificity for their SELEX Target and improved in vivo stability. Post-SELEX modifications made to 2′-OH Nucleic Acid Ligands can result in improved in vivo stability without adversely affecting the binding capacity of the Nucleic Acid Ligand. The preferred modifications of the Nucleic Acid Ligands of the subject invention are 5′ and 3′ phosphorothioate capping and/or 3′-3′ inverted phosphodiester linkage at the 3′ end. In one preferred embodiment, the preferred modification of the Nucleic Acid Ligand is a 3′-3′ inverted phosphodiester linkage at the 3′ end. Additional 2′-fluoro (2′-F) and/or 2′-amino (2′-NH\n2\n) and/or 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) modification of some or all of the nucleotides is preferred. Described herein are Nucleic Acid Ligands that were 2′-NH\n2 \nmodified or 2′-F modified and incorporated into the SELEX process. Further described herein are 2′-F modified Nucleic Acid Ligands derived from the SELEX process which were modified to comprise 2′-OMe purines in post-SELEX modifications.\n\n\nOther modifications are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications may be made post-SELEX (modification of previously identified unmodified ligands) or by incorporation into the SELEX process.\n\n\nAs described above, because of their ability to selectively bind C1q, C3 and C5, the Nucleic Acid Ligands to C1q, C3 and C5 described herein are useful as pharmaceuticals. This invention, therefore, also includes a method for treating Complement System-mediated diseases by administration of a Nucleic Acid Ligand capable of binding to a Complement System Protein or homologous proteins. Certain diseases or conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or myocardial infarction activate C1q through the collagen-like region. In Alzheimer's disease, β-amyloid activates C1q. Structures in heart muscle that are exposed during myocardial infarction such as intermediate filaments, mitochondrial membranes or actin activate C1q. Nucleic Acid Ligands to C3 or to C5 could also inhibit Complement System activation in Alzheimer's disease or myocardial infarction, whether the Complement System is activated through C1q by antibody or non-antibody mechanisms, or independent of C1q through the alternative pathway. Thus, the Nucleic Acid Ligands of the present invention may be useful in treating Alzheimer's disease or myocardial infarction.\n\n\nTherapeutic compositions of the Nucleic Acid Ligands may be administered parenterally by injection, although other effective administration forms, such as intraarticular injection, inhalant mists, orally active formulations, transdermal iontophoresis or suppositories are also envisioned. One preferred carrier is physiological saline solution, but it is contemplated that other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may also be used. In one preferred embodiment, it is envisioned that the carrier and the Nucleic Acid Ligand constitute a physiologically-compatible, slow release formulation. The primary solvent in such a carrier may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. In addition, the carrier may contain other pharmacologically-acceptable excipients for modifying or maintaining the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution, or odor of the formulation. Similarly, the carrier may contain still other pharmacologically-acceptable excipients for modifying or maintaining the stability, rate of dissolution, release or absorption of the ligand. Such excipients are those substances usually and customarily employed to formulate dosages for parental administration in either unit dose or multi-dose form.\n\n\nOnce the therapeutic composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready to use form or requiring reconstitution immediately prior to administration. The manner of administering formulations containing Nucleic Acid Ligands for systemic delivery may be via subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or vaginal or rectal suppository.\n\n\nThe following Examples are provided to explain and illustrate the present invention and are not intended to be limiting of the invention. These Examples describe the use of SELEX methodology to identify high affinity RNA ligands to C1q, C3 and C5. Example 1 describes the various materials and experimental procedures used in Examples 2, 3, 4 and 6. Example 2 describes the generation of 2′-NH\n2 \nRNA ligands to C1q. Example 3 describes the generation of 2′-F Nucleic Acid Ligands of Complement System Protein C3. Example 4 describes the generation of 2′-F Nucleic Acid Ligands of Complement System Protein C5. Example 5 describes the activation of the Complement System through C1q ligands. Example 6 describes the generation of 2′-F RNA ligands to C1q. Example 7 describes an assay for hemolytic inhibition for 2′-F RNA ligands to C5. Example 8 describes an assay for inhibition of C5a release by a Nucleic Acid Ligand (clone C6) to Human C5. Example 9 describes boundary experiments performed to determine the minimum binding sequence for Nucleic Acid Ligands to Human C5. Example 10 describes a Biased SELEX experiment performed to improve Nucleic Acid Ligand affinity, using a 42mer truncated sequence of clone C6 as the random sequence in the template. Example 11 describes the results of 2′-OMe purine substitutions in a Human C5 Nucleic Acid Ligand in an interference assay. Example 12 describes the structure of a 38mer truncate of a Nucleic Acid Ligand to human C5. Example 13 describes a hemolytic assay of 2′-OMe purine substituted Nucleic Acid Ligands to human C5.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nExperimental Procedures\n\n\nThis example provides general procedures followed and incorporated in Examples 2, 3, 4 and 6 for the identification of 2′-NH\n2 \nand 2′-F RNA ligands to C1q, and 2′-F ligands to C3 and C5.\n\n\nA. Biochemicals\n\n\nC1q, C3, C5 and C4-deficient guinea pig sera were obtained from Quidel (San Diego, Calif.). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), rabbit anti-BSA, CRP, SAP and β-amyloid peptides 1-40 and 1-42 were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Nucleotides GTP, ATP and deoxynucleotides were obtained from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Taq polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, Conn.). \nModified nucleotides\n 2′-NH\n2\n-CTP and 2′-NH\n2\n-UTP, and 2′-F-CTP and 2′-F-UTP, were prepared as described in Jellinek et al. (1995) Biochem. 34:11363. Avian reverse transcriptase was obtained from Life Sciences (St. Petersburg, Fla.) and T7 RNA polymerase from USB (Cleveland, Ohio). Nitrocellulose filters were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, Mass.). All chemicals were the highest grade available.\n\n\nB. RNA SELEX Procedures\n\n\nThe SELEX procedure has been described in detail in the SELEX Patent Applications (see also Jellinek et al. (1995) Biochem. 34:11363; Jellinek et al. (1994) Biochem. 33: 10450). Briefly, a DNA template was synthesized with a 5′ fixed region containing the T7 promoter, followed by a 30N or a 50N stretch of random sequence, and then with a 3′-fixed region (Table 1; SEQ ID NOS:1 and 156). For the initial round of the SELEX process, 1 nmole (˜10\n14 \nunique sequences) of RNA (Table 1; SEQ ID NOS:2 and 157) was in vitro transcribed by T7 polymerase (Milligan et al. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 12:785) using mixed GTP/ATP and 2′-NH\n2\n-CTP/UTP or 2′-F-CTP/UTP nucleotides, and with the addition of α-[\n32\nP]-ATP. For this and subsequent rounds of the SELEX process, the RNA was purified by electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels with 7 M urea, 10 mM Tris-Borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3 running buffer. After autoradiography, the band containing labeled, modified RNA transcript was excised and frozen at −70° C., then 400 μL of 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA was added, the gel was mashed, and the slurry was spun through 2 cm of glass-wool (Rnase-free—Alltech Associates, Deerfield, Ill.) and two nitrocellulose filters. The RNA was precipitated by addition of 1/5 vol of 6.6 M NH\n4\nOAc, pH 7.7, plus 2 vol of ethanol. The pellet was washed twice with 80% ethanol, and taken to dryness. The dry RNA pellet was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (Sambrook et al. (1989) \nMolecular Cloning. A laboratory Manual\n. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) containing 1 mM MgCl\n2 \n(MgPBS).\n\n\nFor each round of the SELEX process, the RNA was incubated with C1q, C3 or C5 in MgPBS for 10 minutes at 37° C. Then the sample was filtered through a 43 mm nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was washed with 10 mL of MgPBS. For some rounds, the diluted RNA was pre-soaked with nitrocellulose filters overnight to reduce background. Four samples were run in parallel for most rounds with lesser amounts (chosen to be in suitable range to measure binding) of both RNA and C1q, C3 or C5 to measure binding K\nd \nfor each sample. In addition, at each round, a sample of RNA was filtered without protein to determine background.\n\n\nFilters were air-dried, sliced into strips, counted, and then extracted for 60 minutes at 37° C. with 400 μL of 1% SDS, 0.5 mg/mL Proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), 1.5 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5, with addition of 40 μg tRNA carrier. The aqueous RNA was extracted with phenol, phenol/chloroform (1: 1), and chloroform and then precipitated following addition of NH\n4\nOAc/EtOH as above. The RNA was reverse transcribed in a volume of 50 μL for between 1 hour and overnight. The DNA was PCR amplified with specific primers (Table 1; SEQ ID NOS:3-4) in a volume of 500 μL for 12-14 cycles, and then phenol/chloroform extracted and NaOAc/EtOH precipitated. The DNA pellet was taken up in H\n2\nO, and an aliquot was T7 transcribed for the next round of the SELEX process.\n\n\nC. Cloning\n\n\nDNA from the 12\nth \nor the 14\nth \nround was PCR amplified with primers which also contained a ligation site to facilitate cloning. The DNA was cloned into a pUC9 vector, and colonies were picked for overnight growth and plasmid mini-preps (PERFECTprep, 5′-3′, Boulder, Colo.). The purified plasmids were PCR amplified with original 3′ and 5′ primers (as above), and products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Sambrook et al. (1989) \nMolecular Cloning. A laboratory Manual\n. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). DNA was T7 transcribed with α-[\n32\nP]-ATP to prepare radiolabeled RNA for binding analysis and without radiolabel to prepare RNA for inhibition studies.\n\n\nD. Sequencing\n\n\nPlasmids purified using the PERFECTprep kit were sequenced with ABI dRhodamine Terminator cycling kit (Perkin-Elmer). Samples were sequenced on the ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer.\n\n\nE. Binding Assays\n\n\nIndividual cloned DNA was T7 transcribed with α-[\n32\nP]-ATP and the full length [\n32\nP]-2′-NH\n2\n-RNA or 2′-F-RNA was gel-purified (as above). RNA was suspended at approximately 5,000 cpm per 30 μL sample (<10 pM), and aliquots were incubated with various concentrations of C1q, C3 or C5 in MgPBS for 10 minutes at 37° C. Samples were then filtered through nitrocellulose, the filters washed with buffer and dried under an infrared lamp, and counted with addition of scintillation fluid (Ecoscint A, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, Ga.). A background sample of RNA alone was run in parallel. To measure inhibition of ligand binding to C1q, the RNA Nucleic Acid Ligand plus C1q plus inhibitor (e.g., the A-chain residue 14-26 site, SAP, β-amyloid peptide, CRP) were incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C., and then filtered. Filters were washed and counted.\n\n\nRNA ligand binding to C1q was also measured in the presence of immune-complexes, which would block the binding of ligands to C1q head-groups. Immune complexes (IC) were formed by mixing 620 μg BSA at equivalence with 1 mL of rabbit anti-BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) plus PEG 8000 added to 1% final concentration, and then the samples were incubated overnight at 4° C. The IC were pelleted by microfugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes, washed five times with PBS, and suspended in 1 mL of MgPBS. For measurement of C1q RNA clone binding to C1q-immune complexes (C1q-IC), 20 μL of the purified [\n32\nP]-RNA plus 20 μL of the IC were mixed with 20 μL of C1q at various concentrations at between 10\n−11 \nand 10\n−7 \nM in MgPBS plus 1% Triton. Samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, microfuged, and the pellets and supernatants counted.\n\n\nF. Hemolytic Assays\n\n\nComplement System consumption was measured by C4 hemolytic assay as described (Gaither et al. (1974) J. Immunol. 113:574). All samples were diluted and the assay run in veronal-buffered saline containing calcium, magnesium and 1% gelatin (GVB\n++\n-complement buffer). For measurement of C4 consumption by β-amyloid peptide consumption, the peptide was added at 250 μg/mL to a ⅛ dilution of whole human serum and then incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. The sample was then diluted for assay of C4 hemolytic activity. For assay of inhibition of β-amyloid peptide mediated complement consumption by \nC1q\n 2′-NH\n2\n-RNA clones, the C1q RNA Nucleic Acid Ligand was included in the initial β-amyloid peptide-whole human serum incubation mixture, and then C4 amounts assayed as above.\n\n\nComplement System inhibition by C5 Nucleic Acid Ligands was measured using human serum and antibody-coated sheep red blood cells. The red blood cells were incubated with a 1:40 dilution of fresh human serum and with serial dilutions of C5 ligand for 30 minutes at 37° C. Dilutions of serum and ligand were made in complement buffer (see previous paragraph). After incubation the samples were then diluted with 4° C. buffer containing EDTA to stop the reaction, and the hemoglobin release was quantitated from the optical density at 412 nm.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n2′-NH\n2 \nRNA Ligands to C1q\n\n\nA. RNA SELEX\n\n\nThe pool of random 50N7-2′-NH\n2 \nRNA bound to C1q by nitrocellulose filter assay with a K\nd \nof 2.3 μM. For \nround\n 1 of the SELEX process, the C1q concentration was between 0.156-1.25 μM and the RNA concentration was 15 μM. Throughout the SELEX process, the RNA concentrations were maintained at approximately 10-fold greater than the concentration of C1q, which was reduced at each round with a final round 14 C1q concentration of 136 pM. Background binding of RNA to nitrocellulose filters remained low throughout the SELEX procedure, in part because RNA was pre-adsorbed with nitrocellulose filters. The binding of pool RNA to C1q improved at each round. The evolved round 14 \npool\n 2′-NH\n2 \nRNA bound C1q with a K\nd\n=670 pM, yielding an overall improvement in binding K\nd \nof 3400-fold.\n\n\nBulk RNA was then cloned for sequence determination and evaluation of binding. Through comparison of binding at 0.1 and 0.5 nM C1q, individual clones were ranked, and clones with C1q binding above background were sequenced and are shown in Table 2 (SEQ ID NOS:5-20). \nFamily\n 1 contained 12 of the 19 total sequences. \nFamily\n 2 contained three sequences. Both \nFamily\n 3 and Family 4 contained two sequences. Both \nFamily\n 1 and \nFamily\n 2 sequences contain G-rich regions and both have the repeated sequence motifs GGAG and GGUG. The identity and homology of Family I members is greatest in the 5′ half, which is G-rich. The C-rich 3′ half has only short stretches of sequence homology, and these are shown only with inclusion of large gap regions. Sequences from all families can be folded to give stem-loop structures with extensive Watson-Crick base-pairing. Full binding curves for the highest affinity ligands yielded a K\nd \nrange from 290 pM to 3.9 nM; the high affinity ligands were found in all four sequence families. All of the binding curves were monophasic. The binding maximum is not 100% because of variable amounts of nucleic acid alterations taking place during purification. This is known because usually ligands can be bound to protein, extracted, and then re-bound, and give maximum binding approaching 100% (data not shown).\n\n\nB. Competition\n\n\n2′-NH\n2 \nRNA ligands from different families interact with the same or overlapping sites on C1q, as shown by cross-competition. This site is on the collagen-like region, at or near the A-chain 14-26 residue site (Jiang et al. (1994) J. Immunol. 152:5050) as shown by two lines of evidence. First, C1q when bound to IC still binds the ligand #50 (SEQ ID NO:12); binding to immunoglobulin Fc would block the head region, but leave the collagen-like tail available, suggesting that nucleic acid ligands derived by the SELEX process are bound to the tail. Second, and more direct, \nligand #\n50 is competed by proteins which are known to bind the A-chain residue 14-26 site, including SAP, β-amyloid peptide and CRP. Finally, \nligand #\n50 is competed by a peptide that has the same amino acid sequence as residues 14-26 on the A-chain. This result is further supported by results for hemolytic inhibition as described below.\n\n\nC. Consumption\n\n\nBinding of a nucleic acid ligand derived by the SELEX process to the A-chain 14-26 amino acid site could activate C1q or alternatively, SELEX-derived nucleic acid ligands could inhibit the binding of other molecules and prevent C1q activation. This was tested by measuring C4 consumption in serum after incubation with a 2′-NH\n2 \nSELEX-derived nucleic acid ligands, or after incubation with a known C1q activator together with a 2′-NH\n2 \nnucleic acid ligand. The SELEX-derived nucleic acid ligands when incubated in serum do not consume C4, and thus are not C1q activators. Nor do these ligands at this concentration inhibit serum lysis of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes, which would occur if ligands bound near the C1q head groups (data not shown). The ligands do inhibit C4 consumption by another C1q activator, the β-amyloid 1-40 peptide. This peptide is known to activate C1q through binding at the A-chain 14-26 residue site; therefore, this inhibition confirms that SELEX-derived nucleic acid ligands bind at this A-chain site. Control ligands from the SELEX process that did not bind C1q by nitrocellulose assay were also ineffective in blocking the β-amyloid 1-40 peptide C1q activation.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n2′-Fluoro Nucleic Acid Ligands of Complement System Protein C3\n\n\nIn order to generate ligands to complement protein C3, a library of about 10\n14 \nRNA was generated that contained 30 nucleotides of contiguous random sequence flanked by defined sequences. In this experiment, 30N random nucleotides of the initial Candidate Mixture were comprised of 2′-F pyrimidine bases. The rounds of selection and amplification were carried out as described in Example 1 using art-known techniques. In \nround\n 1 the 30N7-2′-F-RNA and C3 were both incubated at 3 μM. There was barely detectable binding at this round. Both the RNA and C3 concentrations were decreased during the SELEX procedure. Sequences derived from the SELEX procedure are shown in Table 3 (SEQ ID NOS:21-46).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n2′-Fluoro Nucleic Acid Ligands of Complement System Protein C5\n\n\nIn order to generate ligands to human complement protein C5, a library of about 10\n14 \nRNA was generated that contained 30 nucleotides of contiguous random sequence flanked by defined sequences. In this experiment, the 30N random nucleotides of the initial Candidate Mixture were comprised of 2′-F pyrimidine bases. Briefly, a DNA template was synthesized with a 5′-fixed region containing the T7 promoter, followed by a 30N stretch of random sequence, and then with a 3′-fixed region (Table 1; SEQ ID NO: 1). The rounds of selection and amplification were carried out as described in Example 1 using art-known techniques. The initial rounds of the SELEX experiment were set up with high concentrations of 2′-F RNA (7.5 μM) and protein (3 μM), as the binding of C5 to unselected RNA was quite low. The SELEX experiment was designed to promote binding of RNA at the C5a-C5b cleavage site. RNA and C5 were incubated together with small amounts of trypsin, with the reasoning that limited trypsin treatment of C5 produces a single site cleavage and generates C5a-like activity (Wetsel and Kolb (1983) J. Exp. Med. 157:2029). This cleavage led to a slight increase in random RNA binding. Enhanced RNA binding associated structurally with exposure of the C5a-like domain could evolve Nucleic Acid Ligands that bind near the C5 convertase site and could interfere with or inhibit C5 cleavage. The SELEX experiment was performed simultaneously to both the native and to the mildly-trypsinized protein, so that Nucleic Acid Ligand evolution would pick the highest affinity winner. With this procedure the highest affinity winner against the multiple protein species would be evolved, and multiple aptamers and specific aptamers might be obtained out of a single SELEX experiment.\n\n\nFor each round of the SELEX process, the procedure was performed in parallel in separate tubes with approximately 5-fold excess of RNA either in buffer alone or with addition of trypsin at between 0.3 and 0.0001 mg/mL. Samples were incubated in MgPBS for 45 minutes at 37° C., and then filtered through nitrocellulose. The filters were washed, dried and counted, extracted, reverse-transcribed, then PCR amplified and finally T7 transcribed in vitro into RNA using mixed GTP/ATP and 2′-F-CTP/UTP nucleotides and α-[\n32\nP]-ATP. RNA was purified by electrophoresis in 8% acrylamide gels with 7M urea and Tris-Borate EDTA buffer (TBE). RNA was isolated and precipitated with NH\n4\nOAc/ethanol, and then dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 nM MgCl\n2 \n(MgPBS). Filters with the highest binding were carried forward. At the end of each round, all of the RNA that bound to the protein (either with or without trypsin) was pooled. The protein and RNA concentrations at each round were reduced, with final concentrations of 2.5 nM and 10 nM respectively. Trypsin was added at concentrations between 0.3 and 0.0001 μg/mL. Background binding was monitored at each round, and starting at round four the transcribed RNA was presoaked overnight with nitrocellulose filters prior to the SELEX rounds to reduce background.\n\n\nBased on binding of RNA to native C5 by nitrocellulose assay, round twelve DNA was cloned and sequences were obtained as shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS:47-74). Sequences were grouped according to homology and function. Group I sequences are highly homologous and might have arisen by PCR mutation from a single original sequence. Binding affinities of the Group I Nucleic Acid Ligands are very similar and are shown in Table 7. Group II Nucleic Acid Ligands generally bound with similar affinity to Group I Nucleic Acid Ligands, although some weak binders were also present. Group II sequences and length are more diverse than Group I Nucleic Acid Ligands. The C5 Nucleic Acid Ligands do not bind other complement components including C1q, C3, or factors B, H, or D.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligands from each family were also assayed for inhibition of rat Complement System activity (Table 5; SEQ ID NOS:76-83). Nucleic Acid Ligands from Family I and Family III inhibited rat complement, whereas a Nucleic Acid Ligand from Family II did not. An inhibitory Nucleic Acid Ligand can be used to inhibit Complement System activity in various rat disease models including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myocardial infarction, glomerulonephritis, ARDS, arthritis and transplantation.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nActivation of the Complement System Through C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands\n\n\nOligonucleotides can activate both classical and alternative pathways. Particularly, poly-G oligonucleotides which can form G-quartet structures and can interact with the C1q collagen-like region are able to form high molecular weight aggregates, which both bind and activate C1q. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, which have increased non-specific binding as compared with phosphodiester oligonucleotides, are also efficient Complement System activators, particularly poly-G containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Results for oligonucleotide activation of solution phase Complement are shown below where classical pathway activation is measure by the release of C4d fragment by ELISA (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.), and alternative pathway activation is measure by Bb ELISA (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.). Although these pathways are separate, there is evidence to suggest that oligonucleotide activation of both pathways is C1q dependent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[C4d] μg\n\n\n[Bb] μg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\n(Class.)\n\n\n(Altern.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly-AG\n\n\nRandom Co-Polymer\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n18.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly-G\n\n\nRandom Co-Polymer\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n29.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly-\nI\n \n \nRandom Co-Polymer\n \n \n\n\n0\n\n\n14.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly-\nA\n \n \nRandom Co-Polymer\n \n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly-\nU\n \n \nRandom Co-Polymer\n \n \n\n\n0\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly-\nC\n \n \nRandom Co-Polymer\n \n \n\n\n0\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhosphorothioate Oligonucleotides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGC\nGGGG\nCTACGTACC\nGGGG\nCTTTGTAAAACCCCGCC\n\n\n−7.1\n\n\n32.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 197\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTCTCGCACCCATCTCTCTCCTTCT\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBSA-anti-BSA\n\n\nImmune Complexes\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n11.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nβ-Amyloid Peptide\n\n\n \n\n\n2.7\n\n\nn/d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFucoidan\n\n\nSulfated Carbohydrate\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuffer\n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplement System activation is also initiated on the erythrocyte membrane and is tested by hemolytic assays. Known activators, including 2′-OH poly-G and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, as well as potential activators such as multimerized C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands and small (e.g., 15-mer) 2′-F poly-G oligonucleotides are coated on sheep erythrocytes and subsequent lysis of the erythrocytes by serum complement is measured. Methods of coating oligonucleotides and Nucleic Acid Ligands on cells include passive adsorption, chemical conjugation, streptavidin-biotin coupling and specific Nucleic Acid binding. Following treatment with fresh rat or human serum, the deposition of complement components on the cell, membrane damage and lysis are measured by standard methods as would be known by one of skill in the art.\n\n\nA. Aggregation of C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands\n\n\nC1q Nucleic Acid Ligands are dimerized using chemical cross-linkers of various lengths. Alternatively, Nucleic Acid Ligand monomers are biotinylated and then multimerized with streptavidin. Each of these multimers are tested for complement activation and lysis of erythrocytes.\n\n\nThe addition of poly-G sequence to C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands provides additional binding ability and increases the ability of the oligonucleotide to activate the Complement System. In addition, short poly-G sequences on individual C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands can interact to form higher order structures, which serve to multimerize the C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands and cause activation.\n\n\nB. Lysis of Erythrocytes and Leukocytes\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligands that promote erythrocyte lysis are tested on nucleated cells, including lymphocytes and tumor cells. Nucleated cells have mechanisms of complement resistance that erythrocytes lack. For example, nucleated cells can shed antigens, bleb off membrane vesicles containing the complement components and express increased levels of complement inhibitors as compared with erythrocytes and may up-regulate protective mechanisms upon initial complement attack. As high levels of activation are important for cell killing, activators are compared for amount of Complement System component deposition and extent of membrane damage. Also, different types and sources of tumor cells and lymphocytes are tested to determine if susceptibility is cell-type specific.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligands can be generated for virtually any target as described in the SELEX Patent Applications. Nucleic Acid Ligands to L-Selectin have been generated (See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/479,724, filed Jun. 7, 1995, entitled “High Affinity Nucleic Acid Ligands to Lectins,” now U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,228, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The diversity of lectin mediated functions provides a vast array of potential therapeutic targets for lectin antagonists. For example, antagonists to the mammalian selecting, a family of endogenous carbohydrate binding lectins, may have therapeutic applications in a variety of leukocyte-mediated disease states. Inhibition of selectin binding to its receptor blocks cellular adhesion and consequently may be useful in treating inflammation, coagulation, transplant rejection, tumor metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial infarction, bums, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, bacterial sepsis, hypovolaemic and traumatic shock, acute lung injury and ARDS. The coupling of C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands to L-Selectin Nucleic Acid Ligands makes the L-Selectin Nucleic Acid Ligand more efficient by promoting cell killing at the target. C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands are coupled to L-Selectin Nucleic Acid Ligands, and the conjugates are tested for leukocyte lysis as described above. Also, Nucleic Acid Ligands to other cell surface targets, antibodies to all targets that do not themselves activate complement, cytokines, growth factors, or a ligand to a cell receptor could be coupled to a C1q Nucleic Acid Ligand and used for cell killing.\n\n\nC. In Vivo Testing of Complement Activation\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligand-mediated Complement System activation is tested in animals to evaluate in vivo Nucleic Acid Ligand action. Erythrocytes and/or lymphocytes are coated with Nucleic Acid Ligands and injected into rats to test cell killing and lysis in vivo. Activating Nucleic Acid Ligands are also coupled to a Mab that does not activate the Complement System, where the antibody is directed against a rat cell antigen (e.g., lymphocyte antigen). These cells are then coated with the Nucleic Acid Ligand-antibody conjugate and injected into rats. Alternatively, the Nucleic Acid Ligand-antibody conjugate is injected directly into the rat and then in vivo leukocyte killing is measured.\n\n\nIt is also possible that C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands cross-react with non-human C1q, and non-human C1q could be used for in vivo assays. C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands are tested against species such as mouse, rat and rabbit C1q. C1q is purified from serum and cross-reactivity with C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands is tested by nitrocellulose binding assay. Alternatively, C1q is bound to immune complexes which are added to serum and then C1q Nucleic Acid Ligand binding to the aggregate is tested. If Nucleic Acid Ligands are species-specific, then rat serum is depleted of rat C1q by continuous perfusion over a Ig-Sepharose column, and the serum is reconstituted with human C1q by methods known to one of skill in the art. These reconstituted animals are then used to test C1q Nucleic Acid Ligands for targeted Complement System activation and cell killing.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n2′-Fluoro RNA Ligands of Complement System Protein C1q\n\n\nA. RNA SELEX\n\n\nThe pool of random 30N7-2′-F RNA bound to C1q by nitrocellulose filter assay with a K\nd \nof 2.3 μM. For \nround\n 1 of the SELEX process, the C1q concentration was between 0.156-1.25 μM and the RNA concentration was 15 μM. Throughout the SELEX process, the RNA concentrations were maintained at approximately 10-fold greater than the concentration of C1q, which was reduced at each round with a final round 14 C1q concentration of 136 pM. Background binding of RNA to nitrocellulose filters remained low throughout the SELEX procedure, in part because RNA was pre-adsorbed with nitrocellulose filters. The binding of pool RNA to C1q improved at each round. The evolved round 14 \npool\n 2′-F RNA bound C1q with a K\nd \nof 2 nM, yielding an overall improvement in binding K\nd \nof 1-3000 -fold.\n\n\nBulk RNA was then cloned for sequence determination and evaluation of binding. Through comparison of binding at 0.1 and 0.5 nM C1q, individual clones were ranked for binding affinity. Sequences of 2′-F RNA ligands are shown in Table 6 (SEQ ID NOS:84-155). The 2′-F-RNA sequences are not easily grouped into families, but these sequences are G-rich and are similar but not homologous with the 2′-NH\n2 \nRNA sequences described in Example 2.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nHemolytic Inhibition for 2′-F RNA Ligands to C5\n\n\nThe 2′-F RNA Nucleic Acid Ligands to C5 (Example 4) were assayed for hemolytic inhibition by including dilutions in a standard assay for human serum lysis of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes. Sheep cells were mixed with a 1:40 dilution of serum containing Nucleic Acid Ligand or buffer, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. After quenching with cold EDTA buffer, the samples were spun and supernatants read at OD 412 nm. Group I Nucleic Acid Ligands inhibited almost to background at 1 μM, with a K\ni \nof 60-100 nM. The results are shown in \nFIG. 1\n. The results of the hemolysis inhibition assay suggested that 2′-F RNA Nucleic Acid Ligands to C5 target a specific site on C5, where they block interaction of C5 with the Complement C5 convertase. These results also confirmed that the 2′-F RNA Nucleic Acid Ligands are stable in serum.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nInhibition of C5a Release\n\n\nNucleic Acid Ligand-C5 interaction that inhibits cleavage of C5 would prevent formation of the C5b and MAC assembly. Inhibition of C5 cleavage should also inhibit C5a release, and this was shown in the following experiment with clone C6 (SEQ ID NO:51) (Example 4). For this experiment, dilutions of clone C6 were incubated with whole human serum in GVB\n++\n (veronal-buffered saline containing calcium, magnesium and 1% gelatin) plus addition of zymosan for 30 minutes at 37° C. The samples were then quenched with EDTA-buffer and spun, and supernatants were assayed for C5a by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Wagner and Hugli (1984) Anal. Biochem. 136:75). The results showed that clone C6 inhibited C5a release with a K\ni \nof approximately 100 nM (\nFIG. 2\n), whereas control random pool RNA gave no inhibition (data not shown). This assay also demonstrated the serum stability of clone C6.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nBoundaries of Clone C6\n\n\nClone C6 (SEQ ID NO:51) (Example 4) was selected for determination of a minimal binding sequence. This was done in the following two ways.\n\n\n1) The minimal RNA sequences (5′ and 3′ boundaries) required for binding of clone C6 to C5 were determined by partially hydrolyzing clone C6 and determining protein binding (Green et al. (1995) Chem. Biol. 2:683). Briefly, clone C6 was synthesized as either 5′-[\n32\nP]-kinase labeled (to determine the 3′ boundary) or 3′-[\n32\nP]-pCp labeled (to determine the 5′ boundary) and the oligonucleotides were purified. Then the oligonucleotides were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis, which cleaves oligonucleotides from the 3′ end to purine bases. The partially hydrolyzed RNA was then incubated with C5, and RNA which bound to the C5 protein was partitioned on nitrocellulose and eluted from the protein. The partitioned RNA together with an RNA ladder were run on an 8% acrylamide/7M urea sequencing gel. The boundary where removal of one more base would reduce or eliminate binding was determined by comparison of selected RNA (RNA which bound to C5) versus non-selected RNA (RNA which did not bind to C5).\n\n\nThe labeled RNA was also digested with T\n1 \nnuclease (which cleaves oligonucleotides from the 3′ end to A residues), incubated with C5 and partitioned as above, for a second ladder. \nFIG. 3A\n shows the results of the digestion of the 5′-kinase-labeled RNA. In this figure, the 3′-sequence (5′-end labeled) is aligned with the alkaline hydrolysis ladder. On the left is the T\n1 \nladder and on the right are RNA selected with 5× and 1× concentrations of C5. The boundary where removal of a base eliminates binding is shown by the arrow. The asterisk shows a G which is hypersensitive to T\n1\n. Other G nucleotides in the minimal sequences are protected from T\n1 \ndigestion. \nFIG. 3B\n shows the results of the 3′-pCp-ligated RNA. In this figure, the 5′-sequence (3′-end-labled) is aligned with the alkaline hydrolysis ladder. The T\n1 \nand protein lanes, boundary and hypersensitive G nucleotides are as described for \nFIG. 3A\n.\n\n\n2) In a second experiment, the results obtained from the boundary experiments described above were used to construct synthetic truncated Nucleic Acid Ligands to C5. Several truncates between 34 and 42 nucleotides were synthesized by removing residues at both ends of clone C6 (SEQ ID NO:51), and assayed for C5 binding (Table 8). The shortest oligonucleotide which bound to C5 was a 38mer (SEQ ID NO:160), which confirms the boundary gel and which provides a preliminary structure for further Nucleic Acid Ligand development. In the minimal 38mer sequence, 30 bases originated from the random region and eight bases were from the 5′ fixed region of clone C6. Removing a base from both 5′ and 3′ ends of the 38mer to produce a 36mer (SEQ ID NO:161) reduced the binding. A 34mer (SEQ ID NO:162) did not bind. Other truncated oligonucleotides with internal deletions also failed to bind.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nBiased SELEX\n\n\nA biased SELEX experiment was performed to improve Nucleic Acid Ligand affinity and to further define the structure. The sequence of the 42mer truncate (SEQ ID NO:75) from Example 9 (Table 8)was used as a template for the Biased SELEX experiment. A synthetic template comprising a 42N random region flanked by new n8 fixed regions (Table 10; SEQ ID NO:163) was constructed and synthesized (Oligos, Etc., CT), where the random region was biased toward the 42mer truncate of clone C6 from the first SELEX experiment. A 42mer random region was chosen rather than the minimal 38mer sequence, as the four extra bases extended a terminal helix. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, the inventors believed that although these four extra bases were not essential for binding, a longer helix was thought desirable to aid in selecting the Nucleic Acid Ligand structure and in minimizing the possible use of fixed regions in the newly selected Nucleic Acid Ligand structure. Each base in the random region was synthesized to contain 0.67 mole fraction of the base corresponding to the base in the 42mer sequence and 0.125 mole fraction of each of the other three bases. The Biased SELEX experiment was performed as described for the standard SELEX experiment in Example 1. PCR amplification was performed using primers shown in Table 1 (SEQ ID NOS:158-159).\n\n\nThe Biased SELEX experiment was performed with native C5 protein since clone C6 already inhibits hemolysis and trypsin treatment is not required for binding. The binding of the starting RNA pool to C5 was very low, so the protein and RNA concentrations were started at 2.6 μM and 7.1 μM, respectively, similar to the first SELEX experiment. The binding rapidly improved at round three. RNA and protein concentrations were gradually reduced at each subsequent round to final concentrations by round nine of 62.5 pM and 31 pM, respectively. The binding of the RNA pool to C5 was approximately 5 nM (Table 9), as compared to approximately 100 nM for the RNA pool from the first SELEX experiment. Some of the improvements in the affinity of the pool results from absence of lower affinity ligands, size mutants and background binders, which were not allowed to build up to appreciable concentrations during this more rapid SELEX experiment.\n\n\nThe RNA pool after eight rounds of the Biased SELEX process was improved by 20-50 fold over the round twelve pool from the first SELEX experiment. The overall improvement in K\nd \nfrom the random pool to pool from eight rounds of the Biased SELEX process is estimated to be greater than 10\n5\n-fold. The isolated and cloned sequences from the Biased SELEX experiment are shown in Table 10 (SEQ ID NOS:164-189). In the sequences shown in Table 10, the two base-pair stem which is dispensable for binding is separated from the minimal 38mer sequence. These bases show no selective pressure except to maintain the stem. None of the sequences exactly match the original template sequence.\n\n\nClones from the Biased SELEX experiment were assayed and representative binding affinities are shown in Table 11. Most clones bound with a K\nd \nbetween 10 and 20 nM and are higher affinity binding ligands than the template (SEQ ID NO:163). One of the clones, YL-13 (SEQ ID NO:175), bound approximately five-fold higher affinity than other clones from the Biased SELEX experiment and approximately 10-fold higher affinity than clone C6 (SEQ ID NO:51). None of Nucleic Acid Ligand sequences exactly matched the sequence used for the template in the Biased SELEX experiment. Some bases substitutions are unique to this Biased SELEX experiment sequence set and might account for increased Nucleic Acid Ligand affinity.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\n2′-O-Methyl Substitution for Nuclease Protection\n\n\nTo further stabilize the Nucleic Acid Ligand, positions where 2′-OH-purine nucleotides could be substituted with nuclease-resistant 2′-O-methyl nucleosides were determined. An assay for simultaneously testing several positions for 2′-O-methyl interference was used following the method described in Green et al. (1995) Chem. Biol. 2:683.\n\n\nIn the 2′-O-methyl interference assay, three sets of oligonucleotides based on a 38mer truncate of sequence YL-13 (SEQ ID NO:175) from the Biased SELEX experiment were synthesized. These sets of sequences, indicated as M3010 (SEQ ID NO:190), M3020 (SEQ ID NO:191) and M3030 (SEQ ID NO:192) in Table 12 were synthesized on an automated RNA synthesizer in a manner wherein each of the nucleotides indicated by bold underline in Table 12 were synthesized 50% as a 2′-OH-nucleotide and 50% as a 2′-OMe-substituted nucleotide. This resulted in a mixture of 2\n5 \nor 32 different sequences for each of sets M3010, M3020 and M3030.\n\n\nThe partially substituted 2′-OMe oligonucleotides were 5′-[\n32\nP]-kinase-labeled. The oligonucleotides were selected at 100 nM and 10 nM C5 and the binding to protein was greater than 10-fold over background filter binding. The oligonucleotides were eluted from the protein, alkaline hydrolyzed and then run on a 20% acrylamide/7 M urea/TBE sequencing gel. On adjacent tracks were run oligonucleotides not selected with C5. Band intensities were quantitated with on an InstantImager (Packard, Meriden, Conn.). When these oligonucleotides were separated on an acrylamide gel the mixed OH:OMe positions showed up at 50% intensity of a full 2′-OH position, because the 2′-OMe is resistant to hydrolysis. 2′-F pyrimidines are also resistant and do not show on the gel.\n\n\nFor each position, the ratio of (the intensity of the bands selected by protein binding)/(band intensity for oligonucleotide not selected to protein) was calculated. These ratios were plotted versus nucleotide position and a linear fit determined (\nFIG. 4\n, open circles). The same calculation was made for mixed 2′-OH/2′-OMe oligonucleotides, and these ratios were compared with previously determined curve (\nFIG. 4\n, closed circles). Where 2′-OMe substitution did not interfere with binding the ratio was within one standard deviation of the 2′-OH ratio. However, where 2′-OMe substitution interfered with binding, the binding preference for 2′-OH purine increased the ratio. Two nucleotides at positions 16 and 32 were determined to require 2′-OH nucleotides. Separately, residue g5 was determined independently to require 2′-OH and residue G20 was determined to allow 2′-OMe substitution, and these were used to normalize lanes. These results were confirmed by synthesis and assay of 2′-OMe substituted oligonucleotides. The obligate 2′-OH positions are in one of two bulges, or in the loop in the putative folding structure, suggesting these features are involved in the protein interaction. Once the permissible 2′-OMe positions were determined, substituted oligonucleotides were synthesized and relative binding affinities were measured.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nHuman C5 Nucleic Acid Ligand Structure\n\n\nThe putative folding and base-pairing, based on truncation experiments, nuclease sensitivity, base substitution patterns from the Biased SELEX experiment, and 2′-OMe substitutions, for the 38mer truncate of clone C6 together with alternative bases is shown in \nFIG. 5A\n. The basic sequences is the 38mer truncate (SEQ ID NO:160). In parentheses are variants from the first SELEX experiment. In brackets are variants from the Biased SELEX experiment. Lower case bases are derived from the 5′-n7 fixed region from the first SELEX experiment. Upper case bases are derived from the original random region.\n\n\nThe stem-loop structure has between 12 and 14 base-pairs: a) the proposed 5′, 3′-terminal base pairs (c1-a3, and U36-G38); b) stem-loop base-pairs (U11-U14 and G24-A27) are supported by covariant changes during the Biased SELEX procedure; and c) the middle stem (g7-C10 and G28-C34), which is generally conserved, U9-A32 which is invariant and g8-C33 conserved during the Biased SELEX procedure. The u4→c4 change improves binding, and this change is found in all clones from the Biased SELEX experiment, and G29, A29 variants are found only in clones from the Biased SELEX experiment.\n\n\nThe UUU bulge is generally conserved. One original sequence contained two U bases, with no reduction in binding, and two Nucleic Acid Ligands with a single base substitution were found during Biased SELEX experiment. The C10-G28 base-pair following the UUU-bulge is conserved. This region with a conserved bulge and stem is likely involved in protein interaction. The stem-loop G15 to U23 is highly conserved, except for bases 19.\n\n\nThe 2′-OMe substitution pattern is consistent with this structure (SEQ ID NO:193; \nFIG. 5B\n). Positions where 2′-OMe substitutions can be made are shown in bold. The three positions which must be 2′-OH are shown as underlined. The obligate 2′-OH bases at g5, G17 and A32 are in bulge or loop regions which might form unique three-dimensional structures required for protein binding. Allowed positions for 2′-OMe substitution occur in stem regions where a standard helical structure is more likely.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nHemolytic Assay of 2′-OMe-Substituted Nucleic Acid Ligands to Human C5\n\n\nThree oligonucleotides were synthesized based on clone YL-13 from the Biased SELEX experiment to compare the effect of 2′-OMe substitution on hemolytic inhibition: (1) a 38mer truncate B2010 (SEQ ID NO: 194), in which all of the nucleotides were 2′-OH; (2) a 38mer in which one nucleotide (position 20) was a 2′-OMe-G (B2070; SEQ ID NO:195); and (3) a 38mer in which the maximum number of allowable positions (\n \n \npositions\n \n \n 2, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 36 and 38) were synthesized as 2′-OMe-G and 2′-OMe-A (M6040; SEQ ID NO:196) as shown in Table 13. These were assayed in the hemolytic assay as described in Example 7. The results are shown in \nFIG. 6\n. As shown in \nFIG. 6\n, the K\ni \ndecreased with increased 2′-O-Me substitution. The K\nd \nwas marginally better (data not shown). This experiment showed that nucleic acid ligand stability is increased with 2′-OMe substitution, and that long term in vivo inhibition of the complement system is feasible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
