Description\n\n\n\n\n SUBSTITUTED PYRIDO[2,3-d]PYRIMIDIN-7(8H)-ONES AND THERAPEUTIC \n\n\n USES THEREOF \n\n\nCross Reference to Related Applications \n\n\n This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. \n\n\n 61/287,784, filed December 18, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nField of the Invention \n\n\n The invention relates to compounds, methods for their preparation, compositions including them and methods for the treatment of cellular proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to, cancer. \n\n\nBackground of the Invention \n\n\n Cellular proliferative orders such as cancer are among the most common causes of death in developed countries. For diseases for which treatments exist, such as cancer, despite continuing advances, the existing treatments have undesirable side effects and limited efficacy. Identifying new effective drugs for cellular proliferative disorders, including cancer, is a continuing focus of medical research. \n\n\n Mammalian Polo Kinases: There are five mammalian Polo kinases, termed Polo- like kinase (Plk) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Of these, Plkl is the most extensively characterized member and is linked to cell cycle control in the G2/M phases. The protein is relevant to cancer biologists due to its over-expression in a variety of human tumor types, whereby over-expression is linked to poor prognosis. \n\n\n Plk2, or Snk has been identified as an immediate-early gene product. Studies have shown that inhibiting the expression of this gene by siRNA leads to mitotic catastrophe in paclitaxel-treated cells. Furthermore, Plk2 null mutant embryos and embryo fibroblasts display defects in cell cycle progression with respect to decreased proliferation and delayed entry into S phase, respectively, demonstrating a role for this protein in cell cycle regulation. PLK-2 plays an important role in cell cycle control \n\n through the specific phosphorylation of centrosome-associated substrates. Specifically, PLK-2 regulates centriole duplication that occurs at the Gl/S border and is coordinately regulated by CDK2/cyclin E complexes, CDK2/cyclin A complexes, and PLK4. \n\n\n Inhibitors of polo-like kinases tend to affect both Plkl and Plk2, and^Plkl inhibitors have been shown to induce severe myelo-suppression in human subjects. Thus, an antiproliferative agent that is selective for inhibiting Plk2, without affecting PLkl, would be desirable. \n\n\nSummary of the Invention \n\n\n It has been found that certain compounds and compositions are useful for the treatment of cancer and other cellular proliferative disorders.

Ten ng of recombinant Plkl, Plk2, Plk3 or Plk 4 kinase were incubated with the indicated concentrations of compound for 30 minutes at room temperature. Kinase reactions were started by the addition of substrate mix (5μΜ ATP, 10 γ\n32\nΡ-ΑΤΡ, 1 μg α-casein, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n) for 15 minutes at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by 3 % phosphoric acid, spotted on PE30 filtermat, washed, dried and subjected to scintillation counting. Data is plotted (after background subtraction) using GraphPad Prism4 software as a non-linear regression plot with variable slope to obtain IC\n50\n values. \n\n\n Fig. 2 shows the results of an assay of the affinity of the Example 39 compound for Plk2. Increasing concentrations of a biotinylated form of the compound were incubated with U20S lysates. Streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads were utilized to pull down the biotinylated compound in complex with its interacting proteins. The beads were run on a denaturing gel, followed by Western blotting with anti-Plk2 antibody (\"Example 39 Compound-Biotin\"). For competition assays, the biotinylated Example 39 compound was combined with increasing concentrations of free Example 39 compound (\"Example 39 Compound-Free\"). \n\n\n The results of the study, shown in Figure 2 demonstrated that Plk2 was able to form a complex with the Example 39 compound-biotin complex in a dose-dependent manner. This interaction could be readily competed out by the free (unbiotinylated) Example 39 compound, also in a dose-dependent manner. \n\n\n Fig. 3 shows the dose-dependent induction of apoptosis of U20S osteosarcoma cells by the Example 39 compound, 2-(lH-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(2,4- difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-<i]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one. U20S cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the compound for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured by incubating cells with Cell Titer Blue reagent at 37°C for 3 hours under 5% C0\n2\n. Thereafter the cells were incubated with Caspase Glo reagent for 1 hour at room temperature to assay induction of Caspase 3/7 activity. \n\n Detailed Description of the Invention \n\n\n The compounds and compositions of the invention are believed to selectively inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, and kill various tumor cell types without killing (or with reduced killing of) normal cells. One compound, 2-(lH-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8- methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (Example 39) has high anticancer potency, inducing apoptosis in tumor cells at a concentration of approximately 100 nM. The compound is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of Plk2. This is significant, as inhibitors of polo-like kinases tend to affect both Plkl and Plk2, and Plkl inhibitors have been shown to induce severe myelo-suppression in human subjects. Preliminary results indicate that selective inhibition of Plk2 does not induce myelo-suppression in mice, suggesting that such highly selective inhibitors of Plk2, such as 2-(lH-indol-5-ylamino)- 6-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-<i]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one, are useful as non-toxic therapeutic agents. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention are believed to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and for some compounds, induce cell death. Cell death results from the induction of apoptosis. The compounds are believed effective against a broad range of tumor types, including but not limited to the following: ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, renal cancer, colorectal cancer, brain cancer and leukemia. \n\n\n The compounds are also believed useful in the treatment of non-cancer cellular proliferative disorders, including but not limited to the following: hemangiomatosis in newborn, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis, ganglioneuromatosis, keloid formation, Paget's disease of the bone, fibrocystic disease of the breast, uterine fibroids, Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren's disease, restenosis and cirrhosis. \n\n\nI.

For example, for a peptide as shown below: \n\n\n H\n2\nN-Val-Pro-Ala-C(=0)OH which is a substituent on a compound of formula I, the peptide is coupled to the compound of formula I such that a carboxyl moiety of said peptide is coupled to a free amine moiety on the formula I compound. Elimination of water results in the formation of an amide bond. As a practical result, the corresponding monovalent peptidyl substituent is shown to the left of the dotted line in the depiction below of the aforementioned peptide bonded to a compound of formula I: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n The monovalent peptide group may be attached via either an alpha- or a side chain amino group, or an alpha or side chain carboxyl group. The attachment point on the peptide group will depend on the functionality at the terminus of the group by which the peptide group is connected to the compound of formula I or an antibody. \n\n\n Specifically, the peptidyl group may be coupled to a connecting group via an alpha amino or a side chain amino group when a connecting group terminates in, for example: \n\n\n -C(=0)-, -C(=S)-, -S(=0)-, or S0\n2\n. \n\n\n Likewise, the peptidyl group may be coupled to a connecting group via an alpha carboxy or a side chain carboxy group when the connecting group terminates in: \n\n\n -C(=0)NR\n5\n-, -S0\n2\nNR\n5\n-, -NR\n5\n-, -S- or -O-. \n\n\nII.

Exemplary heteroaryl amines include 4-aminoindole, 5-aminoindole, 6- aminoindole, 5-aminoindazole, lH-pyrrolo [2,3 -fr]pyridin-5 -amine, and the like. \n\n\n In order to further illustrate the above nucleophilic substitution, a synthesis of compounds of formula III is shown in Scheme 6 below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the preparation of a compound of formula (III-a) as shown in Scheme 6, a heteroaryl amine compound of formula (A-l) can be used as a nucleophile in a substitution reaction of the compound of formula (I-b'). A useful solvent is toluene (reflux). \n\n\n The aforementioned oxidation processes are carried out by reacting the starting material with an appropriate oxidizing agent in a suitable solvent at an appropriate temperature. Suitable solvents for such oxidation processes typically include alcohols, for example methanol or ethanol, carboxylic acids, for example acetic acid, or chlorinated solvents, for example dichloromethane or chloroform. Suitable oxidizing agents typically include hydrogen peroxide, carboxylic peracids, such as m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, or persulfate salts, such as potassium peroxymonosulfate. In the case of inorganic oxidizing agents such as potassium peroxymonosulfate, hydroxylic solvents such as alcohols are \n\n preferred, and the solvent typically contains water in an amount sufficient to cause the oxidizing agent to remain in solution. The reactions are typically carried out at a temperature between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent, which is typically about 100 °C. The person skilled in the art will know how to select suitable oxidizing agents and reaction conditions. For example, under mild conditions such as low temperature and using a limiting amount of oxidizing agent, selective oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides can often be achieved, whereas under more forcing conditions such as using excess oxidizing agent, higher temperature, or prolonged reaction times oxidation of thioethers or sulfoxides to sulfones can be achieved. Certain reagents (e.g. sodium periodate) are known to oxidize thioethers selectively to sulfoxides. \n\n\n The above-described reactions, unless otherwise noted, are usually conducted at a pressure of about one to about three atmospheres, preferably at ambient pressure (about one atmosphere). \n\n\n The present invention further embraces isolated compounds according to formula I. The expression \"isolated compound\" refers to a preparation of a compound of formula I, or a mixture of compounds according to formula I, wherein the isolated compound has been separated from the reagents used, and/or byproducts formed, in the synthesis of the compound or compounds. \"Isolated\" does not mean that the preparation is technically pure (homogeneous), but it is sufficiently pure to compound in a form in which it can be used therapeutically. Preferably an \"isolated compound\" refers to a preparation of a compound of formula I or a mixture of compounds according to formula I, which contains the named compound or mixture of compounds according to formula I in an amount of at least 10 percent by weight of the total weight. Preferably the preparation contains the named compound or mixture of compounds in an amount of at least 50 percent by weight of the total weight; more preferably at least 80 percent by weight of the total weight; and most preferably at least 90 percent, at least 95 percent or at least 98 percent by weight of the total weight of the preparation. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention and intermediates may be isolated from their reaction mixtures and purified by standard techniques such as filtration, liquid-liquid extraction, solid phase extraction, distillation, recrystallization or chromatography, including flash column chromatography, or HPLC. The preferred method for purification \n\n of the compounds according to formula I or salts thereof comprises crystallizing the compound or salt from a solvent to form, preferably, a crystalline form of the compounds or salts thereof. Following crystallization, the crystallization solvent is removed by a process other than evaporation, for example filtration or decanting, and the crystals are then preferably washed using pure solvent (or a mixture of pure solvents). Preferred solvents for crystallization include water, alcohols, particularly alcohols containing up to four carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and butan-l-ol, butan-2-ol, and 2-methyl-2-propanol, ethers, for example diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran and 1 ,4-dioxane, carboxylic acids, for example formic acid and acetic acid, and hydrocarbon solvents, for example pentane, hexane, toluene, and mixtures thereof, particularly aqueous mixtures such as aqueous ethanol. Pure solvents, preferably at least analytical grade, and more preferably pharmaceutical grade are preferably used. In a preferred embodiment of the processes of the invention, the products are so isolated. In the compounds of the invention according to formula I or salt thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, the compound according to formula I or salt thereof is preferably in or prepared from a crystalline form, preferably prepared according to such a process. \n\n\n The synthetic methods described above reflect a convergent synthesis strategy. Thus two components may be synthesized and elaborated separately prior to condensing or coupling the two components to form the target compounds. These convergent synthetic schemes allow for arrangement of the assembly steps of the backbone of the target compounds and derivatization of derivatizable functionalities to accommodate functional group sensitivity and/or to allow for functional groups or elements to be introduced either before or after the assembly of the backbone of the target compounds via the condensation or coupling reactions described. \n\n\n It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that certain aromatic substituents in the compounds of the invention, intermediates used in the processes described above, or precursors thereto, may be introduced by employing aromatic substitution reactions to introduce or replace a substituent, or by using functional group transformations to modify an existing substituent, or a combination thereof. Such reactions may be effected either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and are included as part \n\n of the process aspect of the invention. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are known in the art. Specific examples of procedures which may be employed include, but are not limited to, electrophilic functionalization of an aromatic ring, for example via nitration, halogenation, or acylation; transformation of a nitro group to an amino group, for example via reduction, such as by catalytic hydrogenation; acylation, alkylation, or sulfonylation of an amino or hydroxyl group; replacement of an amino group by another functional group via conversion to an intermediate diazonium salt followed by nucleophilic or free radical substitution of the diazonium salt; or replacement of a halogen by another group, for example via nucleophilic or organometallically-catalyzed substitution reactions. \n\n\n Additionally, in the aforesaid processes, certain functional groups which would be sensitive to the reaction conditions may be protected by protecting groups. A protecting group is a derivative of a chemical functional group which would otherwise be incompatible with the conditions required to perform a particular reaction which, after the reaction has been carried out, can be removed to re-generate the original functional group, which is thereby considered to have been \"protected\". Any chemical functionality that is a structural component of any of the reagents used to synthesize compounds of this invention may be optionally protected with a chemical protecting group if such a protecting group is useful in the synthesis of compounds of this invention. The person skilled in the art knows when protecting groups are indicated, how to select such groups, and processes that can be used for selectively introducing and selectively removing them, because methods of selecting and using protecting groups have been extensively documented in the chemical literature. Techniques for selecting, incorporating and removing chemical protecting groups may be found, for example, in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Theodora W. Greene, Peter G. M. Wuts (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n In addition to use of a protecting group, sensitive functional groups may be introduced as synthetic precursors to the functional group desired in the intermediate or final product. An example of this is an aromatic nitro (-N0\n2\n) group. The aromatic nitro group goes not undergo any of the nucleophilic reactions of an aromatic amino group. However, the nitro group can serve as the equivalent of a protected amino group because \n\n it is readily reduced to the amino group under mild conditions that are selective for the nitro group over most other functional groups. \n\n\n It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the processes described are not the exclusive means by which compounds of the invention may be synthesized and that an extremely broad repertoire of synthetic organic reactions is available to be potentially employed in synthesizing compounds of the invention. The person skilled in the art knows how to select and implement appropriate synthetic routes. Suitable synthetic methods may be identified by reference to the literature, including reference sources such as Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Ed. B. M. Trost and I. Fleming (Pergamon Press, 1991), Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations, Ed. A. R. Katritzky, O. Meth-Cohn, and C. W. Rees (Pergamon Press, 1996), Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations II, Ed. A. R. Katritzky and R. J. K. Taylor (Editor) (Elsevier, 2\nnd\n Edition, 2004), Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Ed. A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees (Pergamon Press, 1984), Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, Ed. A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees, and E. F. V. Scriven (Pergamon Press, 1996), and Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4\nth\n Ed, J. March (John Wiley & Sons, 1992). \n\n\nIV. Antibody Conjugates \n\n\n Another aspect of the invention relates to antibody conjugates of compounds of formula I of the formula I-L-Ab, or a salt thereof, wherein I is a compound of formula I; Ab is an antibody; and -L- is a single bond or a linking group covalently linking said compound of formula I to said antibody. In one embodiment, the invention relates to antibody conjugates of compounds of formula III of the formula III-L-Ab, or a salt thereof, wherein III is a compound of formula III; Ab is an antibody; and -L- is a single bond or a linking group covalently linking said compound of formula III to said antibody. \n\n\n In a preferred sub-embodiment of the aforesaid conjugates of the formula I-L-Ab, or III-L-Ab, said antibody (Ab) is a monoclonal antibody or a monospecific polyclonal antibody. \n\n\n In a more preferred sub-embodiment of the aforesaid conjugates of the formulae I-L-Ab, or III-L-Ab, the aforesaid antibody (Ab) is a tumor-specific antibody. \n\n Antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies and monospecific polyclonal antibodies, and most preferably tumor-specific antibodies, may be covalently linked to compounds of the present invention. A \"tumor-specific antibody\" is an antibody which specifically binds to a tumor antigen, e.g., an antigen on a tumor cell. \n\n\n The covalent linker between a compound of formula I and an antibody may, in its simplest form, comprise a single covalent bond connecting the compound of formula I to the antibody. More commonly the compound of formula I is attached to the antibody using a suitable bifunctional linking reagent. The term \"bifunctional linking reagent\" refers generally to a molecule that comprises two reactive moieties which are connected by a spacer element. The term \"reactive moieties\", in this context, refers to chemical functional groups capable of coupling with an antibody or a compound of formula I by reacting with functional groups on the antibody and the compound of formula I. \n\n\n An example of a covalent bond formed as a linker between a compound of formula I and an antibody is a disulfide bond formed by the oxidation of an antibody and a compound of formula I, wherein a linking group is used that contains one or more cysteine amino acids. The cysteine residues can be oxidized to form disulfide links by dissolving 1 mg of the a suitable compound of formula I and 0.5 equivalents of the desired antibody in 1.5 ml of 0.1% (v/v) 17.5 mM acetic acid, pH 8.4, followed by flushing with nitrogen and then 0.01 M K\n2\nFe(CN)\n6\n. After incubation for one hour at room temperature, the adduct peptide is purified by HPLC. \n\n\n Another example of a suitable covalent bond formed as a linker between a compound of formula I and an antibody is an amide bond formed by reacting an amino group on a compound of the invention with a carboxylic acid group which forms part of the primary structure of the antibody (Ab) (such as, for example a glutamic or aspartic amino acid residue). Alternately, an amide bond could be formed if the reacting moieties were reversed, i.e., the compound of formula I could contain a carboxylic acid functionality and react with an amino functionality within the Ab structure. \n\n\n Alternatively, a compound of formula I and an antibody Ab may be covalently linked using a bifunctional linking reagent. \n\n For example, adducts can be prepared by first preparing S-(-N-hexylsuccinimido)-modified derivatives of an antibody and of a compound of formula I, according to the method of Cheronis et al., J. Med. Chem. 37: 348 (1994)(the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). N-hexylmaleimide, a precursor for the modified antibody and compound of formula I, is prepared from N-(methoxycarbonyl)maleimide and N-hexylamine by mixing the two compounds in saturated NaHC0\n3\n at 0 °C according to the procedure of Bodanszky and Bodanszky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis; Springer- Verlag, New York, pp. 29-31 (1984)(the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). The product of the resulting reaction mixture is isolated by extraction into ethyl acetate, followed by washing with water, dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n, and is then concentrated in vacuo to produce N-hexylmaleimide as a light yellow oil. S-(N-Hexylsuccinimido)-modified antibody and formula I compound are then prepared from a cysteine-containing peptide and N-hexylmaleimide by mixing one part peptide with 1.5 parts Ν-hexylmaleimide in NN-dimethylformamide (3.3 mL/mM peptide) followed by addition to 30 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The S-alkylation reaction carried out in this manner is complete in 30 minutes. The resulting S-(N-hexylsuccinimido)-modified peptide monomer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC, followed by lyophilization as a fluffy, white powder. \n\n\n Bis-succinimidohexane peptide heterodimers (wherein one peptide is the antibody and the other peptide is attached to the formula I compound) may be prepared according to the method of Cheronis et al., supra from cysteine-substituted peptides. A mixture of one part bismaleimidohexane is made with two parts peptide monomer in NN-dimethylformamide (3.3mL/mM peptide) followed by addition to 0.1 ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature and is usually completed within 30 minutes. The resulting bis-succinimidohexane peptide dimer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC. After lyophilization the material is a fluffy, white powder. \n\n\n Covalently linked adducts of the general formula I-L-Ab of the present invention may be prepared by utilizing homo-bifunctional linking reagents (wherein the two reactive moieties are the same), such as, for example, disuccinimidyl tartrate, \n\n disuccinimidyl suberate, ethylene glycolbis-(succinimidyl succinate), l,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (\"DFNB\"), 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (\"DIDS\"), and bis-maleimidohexane (\"BMH\"). \n\n\n Alternatively, hetero-bifunctional linking reagents may be employed. Such agents include, for example, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (\"SPDP\"), sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-l-3'-dithiopropionate (\"SASD\", Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL), N-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester (\"MBS\"), m-maleimidobenzoylsulfosuccinimide ester (\"sulfo-MBS\"), N-succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate (\"SIAB\"), succinimidyl 4-(]^-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-l-carboxylate (\"SMCC\"), succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate (\"SMPB\"), sulfosuccinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)amino-benzoate (\"sulfo-SIAB\"), sulfo succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylate (\"sulfo-SMCC\"), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate (\"sulfo-SMPB\"), bromoacetyl-p-aminobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester, iodoacetyl-N- hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, and the like. \n\n\n For hetero-bifunctional linking, a compound of formula I is derivatized with, for example, the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl portion of the bifunctional reagent, and the resulting derivatized compound is purified by chromatography. Next, a suitable tumor-specific Mab is reacted with the second functional group of the bifunctional linking reagent, assuring a directed sequence of binding between components of the desired adduct. \n\n\n Typical hetero-bifunctional linking agents for forming protein-protein conjugates have an amino-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-ester) as one functional group and a sulfhydryl reactive group as the other functional group. First, epsilon-amino groups of surface lysine residues of either the Mab or the formula I compound are acylated with the NHS-ester group of the cross-linking agent. The remaining component, possessing free sulfhydryl groups, is reacted with the sulfhydryl reactive group of the cross-linking agent to form a covalently cross-linked dimer. Common thiol reactive groups include, for example, maleimides, pyridyl disulfides, and active halogens. For example, MBS contains a NHS-ester as the amino reactive group, and a maleimide moiety as the sulfhydryl reactive group. \n\n Photoactive hetero-bifunctional linking reagents, e.g., photoreactive phenyl azides, may also be employed. One such reagent, SASD, may be linked to either a Mab or to a formula I compound wherein with an attached peptidyl group, via its NHS-ester group. The conjugation reaction is carried out at pH 7 at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Molar ratios between about 1 and about 20 of the cross-linking agent to the compounds to be linked may be used. \n\n\n Numerous bifunctional linkers, useful as linkers (-L-), exist which have been used specifically for coupling small molecules to monoclonal antibodies, and many of these are commercially available. Examples include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP), 2-iminothiolane (2-IT), 3-(4-carboxamidophenyldithio)propionthioimidate (CDPT), N-succinimidyl-acetylthioacetate (SATA), ethyl-S-acetyl-propionthioimidate (AMPT) and N-succinimidyl-3-(4-carboxamidophenyldithio)propionate (SCDP). Procedures for preparation of immunoconjugates using these linkers is detailed in Cartel, et al, \"Toxin-Targeted Design for Anticancer Therapy II: Preparation and Biological Comparison of Different Chemically Linked Gelonin-Antibody Conjugates\", J Pharm. Sci., 1993, 82, 699-704, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nV. Treatment of Cellular Proliferative Disorders Using Compounds of the Invention \n\n\n According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of treating an individual suffering from a cellular proliferative disorder, particularly cancer, is provided, comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, either alone, or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, preferably tumor cells, in an individual afflicted with cancer is provided, comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, either alone, or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of treating an individual suffering from a cellular proliferative disorder, particularly cancer, is provided, \n\n comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of at least one conjugate of the formula I-L-Ab, either alone, or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n The invention is also directed to the use in medicine of a compound according to formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a conjugate according to formula I-L-Ab, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\n The invention is also directed to the use of a compound according to formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a conjugate according to formula I-L-Ab, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of a cellular proliferative disorder, particularly cancer, or for inducing apoptosis of tumor cells in an individual affected with cancer. \n\n\n Particular and preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention are those wherein the compound of formula I used in the method of treatment, either alone or as part of a composition, or as a component of the antibody conjugate, is a particular or preferred embodiment of the compound of formula I in the description of the compounds and compositions of the invention as provided herein.

Salts of Compounds According to the Invention \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention may take the form of salts. The term \"salts\" embraces addition salts of free acids or free bases which are compounds of the \n\n invention. The term \"pharmaceutically-acceptable salt\" refers to salts which possess toxicity profiles within a range that affords utility in pharmaceutical applications. Pharmaceutically unacceptable salts may nonetheless possess properties such as high crystallinity, which have utility in the practice of the present invention, such as for example utility in process of synthesis, purification or formulation of compounds of the invention. \n\n\n Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, nitric, carbonic, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids, examples of which include formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, pantothenic, trifluoroacetic, trifluoromethanesulfonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, alginic, β-hydroxybutyric, salicylic, galactaric, pivalic and galacturonic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically unacceptable acid addition salts include, for example, perchlorates and tetrafluoroborates. In the present examples of compounds of formula I, compounds containing pyridine groups, or fused-ring pyridines, such as azaindoles, can be isolated as salts of inorganic acids or strong organic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid. \n\n\n Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of compounds of the invention include, for example, metallic salts including alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and transition metal salts such as, for example, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts also include organic salts made from basic amines such as, for example, N^-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), tromethamine (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane), and procaine. Examples of pharmaceutically unacceptable base addition salts include lithium salts and cyanate salts. Although pharmaceutically unacceptable salts are not generally useful as \n\n medicaments, such salts may be useful, for example, as intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of Formula I, for example in their purification by recrystallization. \n\n\n All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound according to Formula I by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound according to Formula I. Preferably the salts are in crystalline form, and preferably prepared by crystallization of the salt from a suitable solvent. The person skilled in the art will know how to prepare and select suitable salt forms for example, as described in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use By P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth (Wiley- VCH 2002). VII. Pharmaceutical Compositions \n\n\n The compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active ingredient in such formulations may comprise from 0.1 to 99.99 weight percent. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" means any carrier, diluent or excipient which is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient. \n\n\n The active agent is preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected on the basis of the selected route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The active agent may be formulated into dosage forms according to standard practices in the field of pharmaceutical preparations. See Alphonso Gennaro, ed., Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Suitable dosage forms may comprise, for example, tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories, or suspensions. \n\n\n For parenteral administration, the active agent may be mixed with a suitable carrier or diluent such as water, an oil (particularly a vegetable oil), ethanol, saline solution, aqueous dextrose (glucose) and related sugar solutions, glycerol, or a glycol such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active agent. Stabilizing agents, antioxidant agents and preservatives may also be added. Suitable antioxidant agents include sulfite, ascorbic acid, citric acid and its salts, and sodium EDTA. Suitable preservatives include \n\n benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorbutanol. The composition for parenteral administration may take the form of an aqueous or non-aqueous solution, dispersion, suspension or emulsion. \n\n\n For oral administration, the active agent may be combined with one or more solid inactive ingredients for the preparation of tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules or other suitable oral dosage forms. For example, the active agent may be combined with at least one excipient such as fillers, binders, humectants, disintegrating agents, solution retarders, absorption accelerators, wetting agents absorbents or lubricating agents. According to one tablet embodiment, the active agent may be combined with carboxymethylcellulose calcium, magnesium stearate, mannitol and starch, and then formed into tablets by conventional tableting methods. \n\n\n The specific dose of a compound according to the invention to obtain therapeutic benefit for treatment of a cellular proliferative disorder will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances of the individual patient including the size, weight, age and sex of the patient, the nature and stage of the cellular proliferative disorder, the aggressiveness of the cellular proliferative disorder, and the route of administration of the compound. \n\n\n For example, a daily dosage from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg/day. Higher or lower doses are also contemplated as it may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases. The daily dosage may be divided, such as being divided equally into two to four times per day daily dosing. The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 1 to about 500mg, more typically, about 10 to about lOOmg of active agent per unit dosage. The term \"unit dosage form\" refers to physically discrete units suitable as a unitary dosage for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired \n\n release profile, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes and/or microspheres. \n\n\n In general, a controlled-release preparation is a pharmaceutical composition capable of releasing the active ingredient at the required rate to maintain constant pharmacological activity for a desirable period of time. Such dosage forms provide a supply of a drug to the body during a predetermined period of time and thus maintain drug levels in the therapeutic range for longer periods of time than conventional non- controlled formulations. \n\n\n U.S. Patent No. 5,674,533 discloses controlled-release pharmaceutical compositions in liquid dosage forms for the administration of moguisteine, a potent peripheral antitussive. U.S. Patent No. 5,059,595 describes the controlled-release of active agents by the use of a gastro-resistant tablet for the therapy of organic mental disturbances. U.S. Patent No. 5,591,767 describes a liquid reservoir transdermal patch for the controlled administration of ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with potent analgesic properties. U.S. Patent No. 5,120,548 discloses a controlled-release drug delivery device comprised of swellable polymers. U.S. Patent No. 5,073,543 describes controlled-release formulations containing a trophic factor entrapped by a ganglioside- liposome vehicle. U.S. Patent No. 5,639,476 discloses a stable solid controlled-release formulation having a coating derived from an aqueous dispersion of a hydrophobic acrylic polymer. Biodegradable microparticles are known for use in controlled-release formulations. U.S. Patent No. 5,354,566 discloses a controlled-release powder that contains the active ingredient. U.S. Patent No. 5,733,566 describes the use of polymeric microparticles that release antiparasitic compositions. \n\n\n The controlled-release of the active ingredient may be stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. Various mechanisms of drug release exist. For example, in one embodiment, the controlled-release component may swell and form porous openings large enough to release the active ingredient after administration to a patient. The term \"controlled-release component\" in the context of the present invention is defined herein as a compound or compounds, such as polymers, polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, liposomes and/or microspheres, that facilitate the controlled-release of the \n\n active ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, the controlled-release component is biodegradable, induced by exposure to the aqueous environment, pH, temperature, or enzymes in the body. In another embodiment, sol-gels may be used, wherein the active ingredient is incorporated into a sol-gel matrix that is a solid at room temperature. This matrix is implanted into a patient, preferably a mammal, having a body temperature high enough to induce gel formation of the sol-gel matrix, thereby releasing the active ingredient into the patient. \n\n\nThe components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at least National Food grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade). Particularly for human consumption, the composition is preferably manufactured or formulated under Good Manufacturing Practice standards as defined in the applicable regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For example, suitable formulations may be sterile and/or substantially isotonic and/or in full compliance with all Good Manufacturing Practice regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \n\n\nVIII. Routes of Administration of Compounds and Compositions of the Invention \n\n\n The compounds may be administered by any route, including but not limited to oral, rectal, sublingual, buccal, ocular, pulmonary, and parenteral administration, or as an oral or nasal spray (e.g. inhalation of nebulized vapors, droplets, or solid particles). Parenteral administration includes, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intravaginal, intravesical (e.g., to the bladder), intradermal, transdermal, topical or subcutaneous administration. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention is the instillation of a drug in the body of the patient in a controlled formulation, with systemic or local release of the drug to occur at a later time. For \n•\n example, the drug may be localized in a depot for controlled release to the circulation, or for release to a local site of tumor growth. \n\n\n One or more compounds useful in the practice of the present inventions may be administered simultaneously, by the same or different routes, or at different times during \n\n treatment. The compounds may be administered before, along with, or after other medications, including other antiproliferative compounds. \n\n\n The treatment may be carried out for as long a period as necessary, either in a single, uninterrupted session, or in discrete sessions. The treating physician will know how to increase, decrease, or interrupt treatment based on patient response. According to one embodiment, treatment is carried out for from about four to about sixteen weeks. The treatment schedule may be repeated as required. \n\n\nIX. Isomerism in Compounds of the Invention \n\n\nA. Geometrical Isomerism \n\n\n The compounds of the invention may possess an olefinic double bond. The stereochemistry of compounds possessing an olefinic double bond is designated using the nomenclature using E and Z designations. The compounds are named according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, described in the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations, Section E: Stereochemistry, in Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 4\nth\n ed., 1992, pp. 127-38, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. Using this system of nomenclature, the four groups about a double bond are prioritized according to a series of rules wherein various functional groups are ranked. The isomer with the two higher ranking groups on the same side of the double bond is designated Z and the other isomer, in which the two higher ranking groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, is designated E. This is illustrated schematically in Scheme 7, where the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system priority of the double bond substituents A is greater than that of B, and the priority of A' is greater than that of B'. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (E) isomer (Z) isomer \n\n\n Scheme 7 \n\n B. Optical Isomerism \n\n\n It will be understood that when compounds of the present invention contain one or more chiral centers, the compounds may exist in, and may be isolated as pure enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms or as racemic mixtures. The present invention therefore includes any possible enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or mixtures thereof of the compounds of the invention which are biologically active in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative disease states. \n\n\n The isomers resulting from the presence of a chiral center comprise a pair of non-superimposable isomers that are called \"enantiomers.\" Single enantiomers of a pure compound are optically active, i.e., they are capable of rotating the plane of plane polarized light. Single enantiomers are designated according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system. Once the priority ranking of the four groups is determined, the molecule is oriented so that the lowest ranking group is pointed away from the viewer. Then, if the descending rank order of the other groups proceeds clockwise, the molecule is designated (R) and if the descending rank of the other groups proceeds counterclockwise, the molecule is designated (S). In the example in Scheme 8, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog ranking is A > B > C > D. The lowest ranking atom, D is oriented away from the viewer. \n\n\n\n\n\n (R) configuration (S) configuration \n\n\n Scheme 8 \n\n\n Chiral centers in the compounds of the invention may occur, for example in the \n\n\n 1 2 substituents attached to the aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic groups Ar and/or R . In addition, compounds wherein n is 1 (sulfoxides), are chiral, having two possible configurations at the sulfur atom, as shown in the example of Scheme 9. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 9 \n\n\n The present invention is meant to encompass diastereomers as well as their racemic and resolved, diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure forms and salts thereof. Diastereomeric pairs may be resolved by known separation techniques including normal and reverse phase chromatography, and crystallization. For example, a compound of Formula I could possess two distinct sulfoxide groups which could provide, in theory, 2\n2\n = 4 diastereomers, namely S,S-, S,R-, R,S-, and R,R- forms. \n\n\n \"Isolated optical isomer\" means a compound which has been substantially purified from the corresponding optical isomer(s) of the same formula. Preferably, the isolated isomer is at least about 80%, more preferably at least 90% pure, even more preferably at least 98% pure, most preferably at least about 99% pure, by weight. \n\n\n Isolated optical isomers may be purified from racemic mixtures by well-known chiral separation techniques. According to one such method, a racemic mixture of a compound having the structure of Formula I, or a chiral intermediate thereof, is separated into 99% wt.% pure optical isomers by HPLC using a suitable chiral column, such as a member of the series of DAICEL\n®\n CHIRALPAK\n®\n family of columns (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The column is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. \n\n\n C. Rotational Isomerism \n\n\n It is understood that due to chemical properties (i.e., resonance lending some double bond character to the C-N bond) of restricted rotation about the amide bond linkage (as illustrated below) it is possible to observe separate rotamer species and even, \n\n under some circumstances, to isolate such species (Scheme 10). It is further understood that certain structural elements, including steric bulk or substituents on the amide nitrogen, may enhance the stability of a rotamer to the extent that a compound may be isolated as, and exist indefinitely, as a single stable rotamer. The present invention therefore includes any possible stable rotamers of formula I which are biologically active in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative disease states. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scheme 10 \n\n\n D. Regioisomerism \n\n\n The preferred compounds of the present invention have a particular spatial arrangement of substituents on the aromatic rings, which is related to the structure activity relationship demonstrated by the compound class. Often such substitution arrangement is denoted by a numbering system; however, numbering systems are often not consistent between different ring systems. In six-membered aromatic systems, the spatial arrangements are specified by the common nomenclature \"para\" for 1 ,4-substitution, \"meta\" for 1,3 -substitution and \"ortho\" for 1 ,2-substitution as shown below (Scheme 11). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"para-\" \"meta-\" \"ortho-\" \n\n\n Scheme 11 \n\n\n Another example of regioisomerism pertinent to the compounds of Formula II, a sub-embodiment of the compounds of Formula I. As discussed below in Scheme 12, benzimidazoles can exist in two isomeric forms (i.e., tautomers). Further derivatization of such benzimidazoles can produce regioisomers. For example, substitution of benzimidazoles by alkylation can provide two N-alkylated regioisomers, which can be separated to provide compounds of Formula I. \n\n E. Tautomerism \n\n\n Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula I, or sub-embodiment compound of formula II, or sub-embodiment compound of formula III, or salts thereof, may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism whereby two chemical compounds that are capable of facile interconversion by exchanging a hydrogen atom between two atoms, to either of which it forms a covalent bond. Since the tautomeric compounds exist in mobile equilibrium with each other they may be regarded as different isomeric forms of the same compound. It is to be understood that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. \n\n\nHowever, it is also to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which can be used to treat an individual suffering from a cellular proliferative disorder, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilized within the formulae drawings. The formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms and it is to be understood that the specification encompasses all possible tautomeric forms of the compounds drawn not just those forms which it has been convenient to show graphically herein. \n\n\n By way of example, it is to be particularly understood that the compounds of Formula II wherein R\nB\n is hydrogen (i.e. Il-a) may exist in tautomeric equilibrium with the form of the compounds wherein the R\nB\n hydrogen exchanges with the nitrogen at the position represented by X\n2\n in the generic Formula II represented above. The equilibrium is illustrated graphically below in Scheme 12. It is to be particularly understood that when R\nB\n is hydrogen, that although the specification and claims may read only upon the compounds of the Formula Il-a (R\nB\n=H), the compounds of Formula II-a' are also included within the scope of the invention, provided that all other bonded positions are held fixed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (II-a') \n\n\nScheme 12 \n\n\nExamples \n\n\n The following non-limiting examples are provided to illustrate the invention. The illustrated synthetic pathways are applicable to other embodiments of the invention. The synthetic procedures described as \"general methods\" describe what it is believed will be typically effective to perform the synthesis indicated. However, the person skilled in the art will appreciate that it may be necessary to vary the procedures for any given embodiment of the invention. For example, reaction monitoring, such as by using thin layer chromatography (TLC), or HPLC may be used to determine the optimum reaction time. Products may be purified by conventional techniques that will vary, for example, according to the amount of side products produced and the physical properties of the compounds. On a laboratory scale, recrystallization from a suitable solvent, column chromatography, normal or reverse phase HPLC, or distillation are all techniques which may be useful. The person skilled in the art will appreciate how to vary the reaction \n\n conditions to synthesize any given compound within the scope of the invention without undue experimentation.

Compounds were tested in 5 dose IC50 mode with 10-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μΜ. Staurosporine, a known protein kinase inhibitor, was tested in 5-dose IC50 mode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 20 μΜ. Reactions were carried out in 10μΜ ATP. The results are shown in Table 5. The results show that the compound of Example 39 is a kinase inhibitor highly selective for the kinase Plk2. \n\n Table 5.

Ten ng of recombinant Plk kinase was incubated with the indicated concentrations of Example 39 compound or wortmanin (a Plk kinase inhibitor) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Kinase reactions were started by the addition of substrate mix (5μΜ ATP, 10 μα γ\n32\nΡ-ΑΤΡ, 1 g -casein, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n) for 15 minutes at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by 3 % phosphoric acid, spotted on PE30 filtermat, washed, dried and subjected to scintillation counting. Data is plotted \n\n (after background subtraction) using GraphPad Prism4 software as a non-linear regression plot with variable slope to obtain IC\n50\n values. The results are shown in Figure 1A (2-(lH-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8-methylpyrido[2,3- c/]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one) and Figure IB (wortmanin). The results show that the Example 39 compound is a potent inhibitor of PLK-2, with little or no inhibitory activity against PLK-1 , PLK-3 and PLK-4. Wortmanin, a positive control, exhibited nanomolar inhibitory activity against Plk-1 , 2 and 3. \n\n\nBiology Example 6 Establishment of Direct Interaction Between Plk2 and 2-(lH-indol-5- ylamino)-6-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-</|pyrimidin-7(\n\"\n8H)- one \n\n\n The direct interaction of the Example 39 compound with Plk2 was confirmed by affinity analysis using a biotinylated form of the compound. Increasing concentrations of a biotinylated form of the compound were incubated for two hours with U20S lysates (0.6 mg/ml) derived from the U20S cell line. The incubation concentrations of biotinylated Example 39 compound are given in Figure 2. Streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads were utilized to pull down the biotinylated compound in complex with its interacting proteins. Pre-cleared streptavidin beads were added to each reaction mixture and incubated overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed and blotted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and run on a 10% acrylamide denaturing gel. For competition assays, the biotinylated Example 39 compound was combined with increasing concentrations of free Example 39 compound. Western blotting was performed using an anti-Plk2 antibody. The results of the study, shown in Figure 2 demonstrated that Plk2 was able to form a complex with the Example 39 compound-biotin complex is a dose-dependent manner. This interaction could be readily competed out by the free (unbiotinylated) Example 39 compound, also in a dose-dependent manner. \n\n Biology Example 7 \n\n\nInduction of Apoptosis in Tumor Cell by 2-(lH-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(2,4- difluorophenylsulfonvn-S-methylpyrido^-S-finpyrimidin-VfSJyt-one \n\n\n A. The dose-dependent induction of apoptosis of U20S osteosarcoma cells by the Example 39 compound was demonstrated as follows. U20S cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the Example 39 compound for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured by incubating cells with Cell Titer Blue reagent (Promega) at 37°C for 3 hours under 5% C0\n2\n. Thereafter the cells were incubated with Caspase Glo reagent (Promega) for 1 hour at room temperature to assay induction of Caspase 3/7 activity. \n\n\nThe results of the experiment in Fig. 3 show that the compound of Example 39 induces apoptosis of U20S osteosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and results in an induction of caspase 3/7 activity in a dose dependant manner. A concomitant dose-dependent decrease in cell viability was observed in the same set of cells, measured by the reduction of the fluorogenic substrate (Cell Titer Blue). \n\n\nB. In a further experiment, U20S osteosarcoma cells were plated onto coverslips and treated for 24 hrs with DMSO or Ι μΜ of the Example 39 compound. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-alpha tubulin antibodies conjugated with FITC followed by 5 μξ/τ ΐ DAPI staining. The coverslips were visualized by fluorescent microscopy using an Olympus microscope at lOOx magnification equipped with the Insight digital camera system. Multiple spindle formation was observed in the Example 39 compound-treated U20S cells, but not DMSO-treated cells. At luM concentration, greater than 95% of the treated cells were mitotically arrested with multipolar spindles, indicating mitotic catastrophe. \n\n\nBiology Example 8 \n\n\nSafety Profile of 2-(lH\nr\n-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(\n'\n2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8- methylpyrido [2,3-</1 py rimidin-7(8H - one \n\n\n A. The following toxicity study was carried out comparing the mammalian toxicity of the Example 39 compound to BI-2536 (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, \n\n Ingelheim, Germany), a Plkl inhibitor presently in clinical trials. DMSO was used as a placebo. Three CD-I female mice were used per group. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally at 100 mg/kg. Viability, signs of toxicity and body weight were monitored over the next 7 days. No signs of toxicity and 100% survival of mice injected with the Example 39 compound were observed, as well as with the placebo. No weight loss was observed for mice injected with the Example 39 compound and placebo. For the set injected with BI-2536, two mice died within 24 hours while the third mouse died within 72 hours, showing signs of toxicity from day 1 after injection. Comparative body weight studies could not be carried out for this compound due to the early death of animals. These observations agree with the known toxicity of BI-2536. In a separate experiment, CD-I female mice were injected with 200 mg/kg of Example 39 compound and examined for signs of toxicity and survival. Following this treatment, 100% survival for >10 days after injection was observed. These studies suggest that although the BI-2536, a potent PLKl inhibitor, causes toxicity in mice at lOOmg/kg dose, the Example 39 compound, which specifically inhibits PLK2, is very well tolerated in mammals. \n\n\nAll references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.
