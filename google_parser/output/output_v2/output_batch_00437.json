These disorders include Alzheimer's disease. These disorders also include mild cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.\n\n\nGlutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n\nAt present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:\n\n\nmGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.\n\n\nLigands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.\n\n\nOther treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by pharmaceutical preparations, i.e., medicaments, as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.\n\n\nDisorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain, drug dependency, smoking cessation und ethanol dependence (\nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2002), 12, (12)).\n\n\nSelective mGluR5 antagonists are especially useful for the treatment of anxiety and pain.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates to a compound of formula I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR\n1 \nis selected from halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, CF\n3 \nand cyano;\n \nR\n2 \nis selected from\n    \n \naryl;\n \naryl substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group selected from lower alkyl, halogen, lower alkoxy, CF\n3 \nand cyano;\n \nheteroaryl; and\n \nheteroaryl substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, halogen, lower alkoxy, CF\n3 \nand cyano;\n \n\n\n \nR\n3 \nis selected from hydrogen, C(O)H and CH\n2\nR\n5\n, wherein R\n5 \nis selected from hydrogen, OH, C\n1\n-C\n6\n-alkyl and C\n3\n-C\n12\n-cycloalkyl;\n \nR\n4 \nis lower alkyl or C\n3\n-C\n12\n-cycloalkyl;\n \nX is N or CH;\n \nY is —(CHR)\n1,2or 3 \n \n \nR is hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n \n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to a process for preparing a compound according to formula I.\n\n\nMoreover, the invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient for the treatment and prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, in particular anxiety and chronic or acute pain.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to a method of treating or preventing acute or chronic neurological disorder comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of formula I. In particular, the pharmaceutical composition is used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe following definitions of general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination.

Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, acute, traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Huntington's chorea, ALS, multiple sclerosis, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, ethanol addiction, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycemia.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially useful as analgesics. Treatable kinds of pain include inflammatory pain such as arthritis and rheumatoid disease, vasculitis, neuropathic pain such as trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, hyperalgesia, severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain associated with various conditions like cancer, angina, renal or billiay colic, menstruation, migraine and gout.\n\n\nThe pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:\n\n\nFor binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a receptor was transiently trans-fected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cyto-technology 15:1-13 (1998)]. Cell membrane homogenates were stored at −80° C. until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronized in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM CaCl\n2\n, 25 mM MgCl\n2 \nbinding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 μg protein/well.\n\n\nSaturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [\n3\nH]MPEP concentrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200 μl) for 1 h at 4° C. Competition experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [\n3\nH]MPEP (2 nM) and IC\n50 \nvalues of test compounds evaluated using 11 concentrations (0.3-10,000 nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4° C.\n\n\nAt the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard BioScience, Meriden, Conn.) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 μl of microscint 40 (Can berra Packard S. A., Zürich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min. For functional assays, [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed as described previously by Porter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (obtainable by FLUKA, 0.2 μM final concentration). [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, Calif., USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.\n\n\nThe inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC\n50\n, and Hill coefficient using an iterative non linear curve fitting software (Xcel fit). For binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula:\n\n\n\nK\n \ni\n \n=IC\n \n50\n/[1\n+L/K\n \nd\n]\n\n\nin which the IC\n50 \nvalues are those concentrations of the compounds tested which cause 50% inhibition of the competing radioligand ([\n3\nH]MPEP). L is the concentration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the K\nd \nvalue of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared.\n\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are mGluR 5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of K\ni\n<100 nM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample No.\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, pharmaceutical preparations containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient (or a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier) are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such pharmaceutical preparations which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nThe dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n4-[1-(Pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-2-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-ylethynyl]-2-methyl-pyridine\n\n\nSodium hydride (69 mg, 55%, 1.59 mmol) was suspended in 2 mL dry THF. A solution of 2-methyl-4-(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-ylethynyl)-pyridine (95 mg, 0.48 mmol) in 8 mL dry THF was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. 2-(Bromomethyl)pyridine hydrobromide (162 mg, 0.63 mmol) was added and stirring was continued overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into 70 mL water and extracted three times with ethyl acetate (70 mL each). The combined organic extracts were dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/methanol 100:0->90:10 gradient) and a mixture of two regioisomers was obtained. This mixture could be separated by crystallization from diethylether and the desired compound was obtained as a white solid (35 mg, 25%), MS: m/e=289.1 (M+H\n+\n).\n\n\nEXAMPLE
