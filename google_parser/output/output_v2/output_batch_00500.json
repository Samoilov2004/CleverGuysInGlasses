More specifically, the invention relates to fully human monoclonal antibodies directed to Ang-2. The described antibodies are useful as diagnostics and for the treatment of diseases associated with the activity and/or overproduction of Ang-2.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nAngiogenesis is the process of forming new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels and is an essential component of embryogenesis, normal physiological growth, repair, and tumor expansion. Although a variety of factors can modulate endothelial cell (EC) responses in vitro and blood vessel growth in vivo, only vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members and the angiopoietins are believed to act almost exclusively on vascular ECs. Yancopoulos et al., \nNature \n407:242-48 (2000).\n\n\nThe angiopoietins were discovered as ligands for the Ties, a family of tyrosine kinases that is selectively expressed within the vascular endothelium. Yancopoulos et al., \nNature \n407:242-48 (2000). There are now four definitive members of the angiopoietin family. Angiopoietin-3 and -4 (Ang-3 and Ang-4) may represent widely diverged counterparts of the same gene locus in mouse and man. Kim et al., \nFEBS Let, \n443:353-56 (1999); Kim et al., \nJ Biol Chem \n274:26523-28 (1999). Ang-1 and Ang-2 were originally identified in tissue culture experiments as agonist and antagonist, respectively. Davis et al., \nCell \n87:1161-69 (1996); Maisonpierre et al., \nScience \n277:55-60 (1997). All of the known angiopoietins bind primarily to Tie2, and both Ang-1 and -2 bind to Tie2 with an affinity of 3 nM (Kd). Maisonpierre et al., \nScience \n277:55-60 (1997). Ang-1 was shown to support EC survival and to promote endothelium integrity, Davis et al., \nCell \n87:1161-69 (1996); Kwak et al., \nFEBS Lett \n448:249-53 (1999); Suri et al., \nScience \n282:468-71 (1998); Thurston et al., \nScience \n286: 2511-14 (1999); Thurston et al., \nNat. Med. \n6:460-63 (2000), whereas Ang-2 had the opposite effect and promoted blood vessel destabilization and regression in the absence of the survival factors VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor. Maisonpierre et al., \nScience \n277:55-60 (1997). However, many studies of Ang-2 function have suggested a more complex situation. Ang-2 might be a complex regulator of vascular remodeling that plays a role in both vessel sprouting and vessel regression. Supporting such roles for Ang-2, expression analyses reveal that Ang-2 is rapidly induced, together with VEGF, in adult settings of angiogenic sprouting, whereas Ang-2 is induced in the absence of VEGF in settings of vascular regression. Holash et al., \nScience \n284:1994-98 (1999); Holash et al., \nOncogene \n18:5356-62 (1999). Consistent with a context-dependent role, Ang-2 binds to the same endothelial-specific receptor, Tie-2, which is activated by Ang-1, but has context-dependent effects on its activation. Maisonpierre et al., \nScience \n277:55-60 (1997).\n\n\nCorneal angiogenesis assays have shown that both Ang-1 and Ang-2 had similar effects, acting synergistically with VEGF to promote growth of new blood vessels. Asahara et al., \nCirc. Res. \n83:233-40 (1998). The possibility that there was a dose-dependent endothelial response was raised by the observation that in vitro at high concentration, Ang-2 can also be pro-angiogenic. Kim et al., \nOncogene \n19:4549-52 (2000). At high concentration, Ang-2 acts as an apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells during serum deprivation apoptosis through activation of Tie2 via PI-3 kinase and Akt pathway. Kim et al., \nOncogene \n19:4549-52 (2000).\n\n\nOther in vitro experiments suggested that during sustained exposure, the effects of Ang-2 may progressively shift from that of an antagonist to an agonist of Tie2, and at later time points, it may contribute directly to vascular tube formation and neovessel stabilization. Teichert-Kuliszewska et al., \nCardiovasc. Res. \n49:659-70 (2001). Furthermore, if ECs were cultivated on fibrin gel, activation of Tie2 with Ang-2 was also observed, perhaps suggesting that the action of Ang-2 could depend on EC differentiation state. Teichert-Kuliszewska et al., \nCardiovasc. Res. \n49:659-70 (2001). In microvascular EC cultured in a three-dimensional collagen gel, Ang-2 can also induce Tie2 activation and promote formation of capillary-like structures. Mochizuki et al., \nJ. Cell. Sci. \n115:175-83 (2002). Use of a 3-D spheroidal coculture as an in vitro model of vessel maturation demonstrated that direct contact between ECs and mesenchymal cells abrogates responsiveness to VEGF, whereas the presence of VEGF and Ang-2 induced sprouting. Korff et al., \nFaseb J. \n15:447-57 (2001). Etoh et al. demonstrated that ECs that constitutively express Tie2, the expression of MMP-1, -9 and u-PA were strongly up-regulated by Ang-2 in the presence of VEGF. Etoh, et al., \nCancer Res. \n61:2145-53 (2001). With an in vivo pupillary membrane model, Lobov et al. showed that Ang-2 in the presence of endogenous VEGF promotes a rapid increase in capillary diameter, remodeling of the basal lamina, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and stimulates sprouting of new blood vessels. Lobov et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n99:11205-10 (2002). By contrast, Ang-2 promotes endothelial cell death and vessel regression without endogenous VEGF. Lobov et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n99:11205-10 (2002). Similarly, with an in vivo tumor model, Vajkoczy et al. demonstrated that multicellular aggregates initiate vascular growth by angiogenic sprouting via the simultaneous expression of VEGFR-2 and Ang-2 by host and tumor endothelium. Vajkoczy et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n109:777-85 (2002). This model illustrated that the established microvasculature of growing tumors is characterized by a continuous remodeling, putatively mediated by the expression of VEGF and Ang-2. Vajkoczy et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n109:777-85 (2002).\n\n\nKnock-out mouse studies of Tie-2 and Angiopoietin-1 show similar phenotypes and suggest that Angiopoietin-1 stimulated Tie-2 phosphorylation mediates remodeling and stabilization of developing vessel, promoting blood vessel maturation during angiogenesis and maintenance of endothelial cell-support cell adhesion (Dumont et al., \nGenes \n& \nDevelopment, \n8:1897-1909 (1994); Sato, \nNature, \n376:70-74 (1995); (Thurston, G. et al., 2000 Nature Medicine: 6, 460-463)). The role of Angiopoietin-1 is thought to be conserved in the adult, where it is expressed widely and constitutively (Hanahan, \nScience, \n277:48-50 (1997); Zagzag, et al., \nExp Neurology, \n159:391-400 (1999)). In contrast, Angiopoietin-2 expression is primarily limited to sites of vascular remodeling where it is thought to block the constitutive stabilizing or maturing function of Angiopoietin-1, allowing vessels to revert to, and remain in, a plastic state which may be more responsive to sprouting signals (Hanahan, 1997; Holash et al., \nOncogene \n18:5356-62 (1999); Maisonpierre, 1997). Studies of Angiopoietin-2 expression in pathological angiogenesis have found many tumor types to show vascular Angiopoietin-2 expression (Maisonpierre et al., \nScience \n277:55-60 (1997)). Functional studies suggest Angiopoietin-2 is involved in tumor angiogenesis and associate Angiopoietin-2 overexpression with increased tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model (Ahmad, et al., \nCancer Res., \n61:1255-1259 (2001)). Other studies have associated Angiopoietin-2 overexpression with tumor hypervascularity (Etoh, et al., \nCancer Res. \n61:2145-53 (2001); Tanaka et al., \nCancer Res. \n62:7124-29 (2002)).\n\n\nIn recent years Angiopoietin-1, Angiopoietin-2 and/or Tie-2 have been proposed as possible anti-cancer therapeutic targets. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,185, U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,490 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,464 each disclose anti-Tie-2 ligand and receptor antibodies. Studies using soluble Tie-2 were reported to decrease the number and size of tumors in rodents (Lin, 1997; Lin 1998). Siemester et al. (1999) generated human melanoma cell lines expressing the extracellular domain of Tie-2, injected these into nude mice and reported soluble Tie-2 to result in significant inhibition of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. Given both Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2 bind to Tie-2, it is unclear from these studies whether Angiopoietin-1, Angiopoietin-2 or Tie-2 would be an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. However, effective anti-Angiopoietin-2 therapy is thought to be of benefit in treating diseases such as cancer, in which progression is dependant on aberrant angiogenesis where blocking the process can lead to prevention of disease advancement (Folkman, J., \nNature Medicine. \n1: 27-31 (1995). In addition some groups have reported the use of antibodies that bind to Angiopoietin-2, See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,185 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0124129 A1. Study of the effect of focal expression of Angiopoietin-2 has shown that antagonizing the Angiopoietin-1/Tie-2 signal loosens the tight vascular structure thereby exposing ECs to activating signals from angiogenesis inducers, e.g. VEGF (Hanahan, 1997). This pro-angiogenic effect resulting from inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 indicates that anti-Angiopoietin-1 therapy would not be an effective anti-cancer treatment.\n\n\nAng-2 is expressed during development at sites where blood vessel remodeling is occurring. Maisonpierre et al., \nScience \n277:55-60 (1997). In adult individuals, Ang-2 expression is restricted to sites of vascular remodeling as well as in highly vascularized tumors, including glioma, Osada et al., \nInt. J. Oncol. \n18:305-09 (2001); Koga et al., \nCancer Res. \n61:6248-54 (2001), hepatocellular carcinoma, Tanaka et al, \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n103:341-45 (1999), gastric carcinoma, Etoh, et al., \nCancer Res. \n61:2145-53 (2001); Lee et al, \nInt. J. Oncol. \n18:355-61 (2001), thyroid tumor, Bunone et al., \nAm J Pathol \n155:1967-76 (1999), non-small cell lung cancer, Wong et al., \nLung Cancer \n29:11-22 (2000), and cancer of colon, Ahmad et al., \nCancer \n92:1138-43 (2001), and prostate Wurmbach et al., \nAnticancer Res. \n20:5217-20 (2000). Some tumor cells are found to express Ang-2. For example, Tanaka et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n103:341-45 (1999) detected Ang-2 mRNA in 10 out of 12 specimens of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ellis' group reported that Ang-2 is expressed ubiquitously in tumor epithelium. Ahmad et al., \nCancer \n92:1138-43 (2001). Other investigators reported similar findings. Chen et al., \nJ. Tongji Med. Univ. \n21:228-30, 235 (2001). By detecting Ang-2 mRNA levels in archived human breast cancer specimens, Sfilogoi et al., \nInt. J. Cancer \n103:466-74 (2003) reported that Ang-2 mRNA is significantly associated with auxiliary lymph node invasion, short disease-free time and poor overall survival. Tanaka et al., \nCancer Res. \n62:7124-29 (2002) reviewed a total of 236 patients of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pathological stage-I to -IIIA, respectively. Using immunohistochemistry, they found that 16.9% of the NSCLC patients were Ang-2 positive. The microvessel density for Ang-2 positive tumor is significantly higher than that of Ang-2 negative. Such an angiogenic effect of Ang-2 was seen only when VEGF expression was high. Moreover, positive expression of Ang-2 was a significant factor to predict a poor postoperative survival. Tanaka et al., \nCancer Res. \n62:7124-29 (2002). However, they found no significant correlation between Ang-1 expression and the microvessel density. Tanaka et al., \nCancer Res. \n62:7124-29 (2002). These results suggest that Ang-2 is an indicator of poor prognosis patients with several types of cancer.\n\n\nRecently, using an Ang-2 knockout mouse model, Yancopoulos' group reported that Ang-2 is required for postnatal angiogenesis. Gale et al., \nDev. Cell \n3:411-23 (2002). They showed that the developmentally programmed regression of the hyaloid vasculature in the eye does not occur in the Ang-2−/− mice and their retinal blood vessels fail to sprout out from the central retinal artery. Gale et al., \nDev. Cell \n3:411-23 (2002). They also found that deletion of Ang-2 results in profound defects in the patterning and function of the lymphatic vasculature. Gale et al., \nDev. Cell \n3:411-23 (2002). Genetic rescue with Ang-1 corrects the lymphatic, but not the angiogenesis defects. Gale et al., \nDev. Cell \n3:411-23 (2002).\n\n\nPeters and his colleagues reported that soluble Tie2, when delivered either as recombinant protein or in a viral expression vector, inhibited in vivo growth of murine mammary carcinoma and melanoma in mouse models. Lin et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n95:8829-34 (1998); Lin et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n100:2072-78 (1997). Vascular densities in the tumor tissues so treated were greatly reduced. In addition, soluble Tie2 blocked angiogenesis in the rat corneal stimulated by tumor cell conditioned media. Lin et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n100:2072-78 (1997). Furthermore, Isner and his team demonstrated that addition of Ang-2 to VEGF promoted significantly longer and more circumferential neovascularity than VEGF alone. Asahara et al., \nCirc. Res. \n83:233-40 (1998). Excess soluble Tie2 receptor precluded modulation of VEGF-induced neovascularization by Ang-2. Asahara et al., \nCirc. Res. \n83:233-40 (1998). Siemeister et al., \nCancer Res. \n59:3185-91 (1999) showed with nude mouse xenografts that overexpression of the extracellular ligand-binding domains of either Flt-1 or Tie2 in the xenografts results in significant inhibition of pathway could not be compensated by the other one, suggesting that the VEGF receptor pathway and the Tie2 pathway should be considered as two independent mediators essential for the process of in vivo angiogenesis. Siemeister et al., \nCancer Res. \n59:3185-91 (1999). This is proven by a more recent publication by White et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n100:5028-33 (2003). In their study, it was demonstrated that a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer that specifically binds and inhibits Ang-2 significantly inhibited neovascularization induced by bFGF in the rat corneal micropocket angiogenesis model.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nEmbodiments of the invention relate to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to Angiopoietin-2 and therein inhibit tumor angiogenesis and reduce tumor growth.

In one embodiment, the patient sample is blood or blood serum. In further embodiments, methods for the identification of risk factors, diagnosis of disease, and staging of disease is presented which involves the identification of the overexpression of Ang-2 using anti-Ang-2 antibodies.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention includes a method for diagnosing a condition associated with the expression of Ang-2 in a cell by contacting the serum or a cell with an anti-Ang-2 antibody, and thereafter detecting the presence of Ang-2.

In one embodiment, the antibody that binds Ang-2 is labeled. In another embodiment the antibody is an unlabeled primary antibody and the kit further includes a means for detecting the primary antibody.

For example, a monoclonal, oligoclonal or polyclonal mixture of Ang-2 antibodies that block angiogenesis can be administered in combination with a drug shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation directly. The method can be performed in vivo and the patient is preferably a human patient. In a preferred embodiment, the method concerns the treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases including, but not limited to, neoplastic diseases, such as, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, glioblastoma, and carcinoma of the thyroid, stomach, prostate, breast, ovary, bladder, lung, uterus, kidney, colon, and pancreas, salivary gland, and colorectum.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an article of manufacture including a container.

Accordingly, antagonizing this molecule is expected to inhibit pathophysiological procedures, and thereby act as a potent therapy for various angiogenesis-dependent diseases. Besides solid tumors and their metastases, haematologic malignancies, such as leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, are also angiogenesis-dependent. Excessive vascular growth contributes to numerous non-neoplastic disorders. These non-neoplastic angiogenesis-dependent diseases include: atherosclerosis, haemangioma, haemangioendothelioma, angiofibroma, vascular malformations (e.g. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Teleangiectasia (HHT), or Osler-Weber syndrome), warts, pyogenic granulomas, excessive hair growth, Kaposis' sarcoma, scar keloids, allergic oedema, psoriasis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, follicular cysts, ovarian hyperstimulation, endometriosis, respiratory distress, ascites, peritoneal sclerosis in dialysis patients, adhesion formation result from abdominal surgery, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, synovitis, osteomyelitis, pannus growth, osteophyte, hemophilic joints, inflammatory and infectious processes (e.g. hepatitis, pneumonia, glomerulonephritis), asthma, nasal polyps, liver regeneration, pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, leukomalacia, neovascular glaucoma, corneal graft neovascularization, trachoma, thyroiditis, thyroid enlargement, and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is a Western Blot showing that Ang-2 mAbs inhibit Ang-2-induced phosphorylation of Tie2 ectopically expressed in HEK293F cells.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n is a line graph of the dose-response relationship of anti-Ang-2 monoclonal antibodies on the inhibition of Ang-2 induced Tie2 phosphorylation.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n is a line graph showing inhibition of both Ang-1 (top graph) and Ang-2 (bottom graph) binding to Tie2 in a dose-dependent manner using mAb 3.19.3 or Tie2/Fc.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n is a Western blot showing inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Tie-2 on Eahy 926 endothelial cells by mAb 3.19.3.

scientific and technical terms used herein shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art.\n\n\nStandard techniques are used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See e.g., Sambrook et al. \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2001)), which is incorporated herein by reference. The nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\nAs utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\nAn antagonist may be a polypeptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, small molecular weight compound, an oligonucleotide, an oligopeptide, RNA interference (RNAi), antisense, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof. For a review of RNAi see Milhavet O, Gary D S, Mattson M P. (Pharmacol Rev. December 2003; 55(4):629-48. Review.) and antisense see Opalinska J B, Gewirtz A M. (Sci STKE. Oct. 28, 2003; 2003(206):pe47.)\n\n\nDisease-related angiogenesis may be any abnormal, undesirable or pathological angiogenesis, for example tumor-related angiogenesis. Angiogenesis-related diseases include, but are not limited to, non-solid tumors such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma or lymphoma, and also solid tumors such as melanoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, glioblastoma, carcinoma of the thyroid, bile duct, bone, gastric, brain/CNS, head and neck, hepatic, stomach, prostate, breast, renal, testicular, ovarian, skin, cervical, lung, muscle, neuronal, oesophageal, bladder, lung, uterine, vulval, endometrial, kidney, colorectal, pancreatic, pleural/peritoneal membranes, salivary gland, and epidermoid tumors.\n\n\nA compound refers to any small molecular weight compound with a molecular weight of less than about 2000 Daltons.\n\n\nThe term “Ang-2” refers to the molecule Angiopoietin-2.\n\n\nThe term “neutralizing” when referring to an antibody relates to the ability of an antibody to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the activity of a target antigen. Accordingly, a “neutralizing” anti-Ang-2 antibody is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing the activity of Ang-2. A neutralizing Ang-2 antibody may, for example, act by blocking the binding of Ang-2 to its receptor Tie2. By blocking this binding, the Tie2 mediated signal transduction is significantly, or completely, eliminated. Ideally, a neutralizing antibody against Ang-2 inhibits angiogenesis.\n\n\nThe term “isolated polynucleotide” as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide that has been isolated from its naturally occurring environment. Such polynucleotides may be genomic, cDNA, or synthetic. Isolated polynucleotides preferably are not associated with all or a portion of the polynucleotides they associate with in nature. The isolated polynucleotides may be operably linked to another polynucleotide that it is not linked to in nature. In addition, isolated polynucleotides preferably do not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.\n\n\nThe term “isolated protein” referred to herein means a protein that has been isolated from its naturally occurring environment. Such proteins may be derived from genomic DNA, cDNA, recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin, or source of derivation, the “isolated protein” (1) is not associated with proteins found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g. free of murine proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.\n\n\nThe term “polypeptide” is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein, fragments, and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention comprise the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules and the human kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, as well as antibody molecules formed by combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain immunoglobulin molecules, such as the kappa or lambda light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention may also comprise solely the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof.\n\n\nThe term “naturally-occurring” as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.\n\n\nThe term “operably linked” as used herein refers to positions of components so described that are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For example, a control sequence “operably linked” to a coding sequence is connected in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\nThe term “control sequence” as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences that are necessary either to effect or to affect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are connected. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences may include promoters, enhancers, introns, transcription termination sequences, polyadenylation signal sequences, and 5′ and ‘3 untranslated regions. The term “control sequences” is intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences.\n\n\nThe term “polynucleotide” as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide, or RNA-DNA hetero-duplexes. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.\n\n\nThe term “oligonucleotide” referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.\n\n\nThe term “naturally occurring nucleotides” referred to herein includes deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term “modified nucleotides” referred to herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The term “oligonucleotide linkages” referred to herein includes oligonucleotides linkages such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoraniladate, phosphoroamidate, and the like. See e.g., LaPlanche et al. \nNucl. Acids Res. \n14:9081 (1986); Stec et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n106:6077 (1984); Stein et al. \nNucl. Acids Res. \n16:3209 (1988); Zon et al. \nAnti\n-\nCancer Drug Design \n6:539 (1991); Zon et al. \nOligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, pp. \n87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford England (1991)); Stec et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman \nChemical Reviews \n90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.\n\n\nThe term “selectively hybridize” referred to herein means to detectably and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, or antibody fragments and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%.\n\n\nTwo amino acid sequences are “homologous” if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least about 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure\n, pp. 101-110 (\nVolume\n 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and \nSupplement\n 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. It should be appreciated that there can be differing regions of homology within two orthologous sequences. For example, the functional sites of mouse and human orthologues may have a higher degree of homology than non-functional regions.\n\n\nThe term “corresponds to” is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nIn contradistinction, the term “complementary to” is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence “TATAC” corresponds to a reference sequence “TATAC” and is complementary to a reference sequence “GTATA”.\n\n\nThe following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotide or amino acid sequences: “reference sequence”, “comparison window”, “sequence identity”, “percentage of sequence identity”, and “substantial identity”. A “reference sequence” is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 18 nucleotides or 6 amino acids in length, frequently at least 24 nucleotides or 8 amino acids in length, and often at least 48 nucleotides or 16 amino acids in length. Since two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide or amino acid sequence) that is similar between the two molecules, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) molecules are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two molecules over a “comparison window” to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A “comparison window”, as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 18 contiguous nucleotide positions or about 6 amino acids wherein the polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence is compared to a reference sequence of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides or 6 amino acid sequences and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may include additions, deletions, substitutions, and the like (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman \nAdv. Appl. Math. \n2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nU.S.A\n.) 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, (Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), GENEWORKS™, or MACVECTOR® software packages), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.\n\n\nThe term “sequence identity” means that two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or residue-by-residue basis) over the comparison window. The term “percentage of sequence identity” is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms “substantial identity” as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity, as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.\n\n\nAs used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See \nImmunology—A Synthesis \n(2\nnd \nEdition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ε-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.\n\n\nSimilarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5′ end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction. The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences”; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences”.\n\n\nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial identity” means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.\n\n\nAs discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99% sequence identity to the antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules described herein. In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that have related side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. More preferred families are: serine and threonine are an aliphatic-hydroxy family; asparagine and glutamine are an amide-containing family; alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are an aliphatic family; and phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are an aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding function or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. \nScience \n253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the antibodies described herein.\n\n\nPreferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles \n(Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); \nIntroduction to Protein Structure \n(C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at. \nNature \n354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe term “polypeptide fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence deduced, for example, from a full-length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term “analog” as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following properties: (1) specific binding to a Ang-2, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to block appropriate Ang-2 binding, or (3) ability to inhibit Ang-2 activity. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.\n\n\nPeptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics”. Fauchere, \nJ. Adv. Drug Res. \n15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger \nTINS p.\n392 (1985); and Evans et al. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH—(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CH\n2\nSO—, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch \nAnn. Rev. Biochem. \n61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “antibody” refers to a polypeptide or group of polypeptides that are comprised of at least one binding domain that is formed from the folding of polypeptide chains having three-dimensional binding spaces with internal surface shapes and charge distributions complementary to the features of an antigenic determinant of an antigen. An antibody typically has a tetrameric form, comprising two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” and one “heavy” chain. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form an antibody binding site.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “targeted binding agent” is an antibody, or binding fragment thereof, that preferentially binds to a target site. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent is specific for only one target site. In other embodiments, the targeted binding agent is specific for more than one target site. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent may be a monoclonal antibody and the target site may be an epitope.\n\n\n“Binding fragments” of an antibody are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, and single-chain antibodies. An antibody other than a “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. An antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a receptor to a counter-receptor when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of receptor bound to counter-receptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, and more usually greater than about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).\n\n\nAn antibody may be oligoclonal, a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, a multi-specific antibody, a bi-specific antibody, a catalytic antibody, a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody, a fully human antibody, an anti-idiotypic antibody and antibodies that can be labeled in soluble or bound form as well as fragments, variants or derivatives thereof, either alone or in combination with other amino acid sequences provided by known techniques. An antibody may be from any species. The term antibody also includes binding fragments of the antibodies of the invention; exemplary fragments include Fv, Fab, Fab′, single stranded antibody (svFC), dimeric variable region (Diabody) and disulphide stabilized variable region (dsFv).\n\n\nThe term “epitope” includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and may, but not always, have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is ≦1 μM, preferably ≦100 nM and most preferably ≦10 nM.\n\n\nThe term “agent” is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.\n\n\n“Active” or “activity” in regard to an Ang-2 polypeptide refers to a portion of an Ang-2 polypeptide that has a biological or an immunological activity of a native Ang-2 polypeptide. “Biological” when used herein refers to a biological function that results from the activity of the native Ang-2 polypeptide. A preferred Ang-2 biological activity includes, for example, Ang-2 induced angiogenesis.\n\n\n“Mammal” when used herein refers to any animal that is considered a mammal. Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\nDigestion of antibodies with the enzyme, papain, results in two identical antigen-binding fragments, known also as “Fab” fragments, and a “Fc” fragment, having no antigen-binding activity but having the ability to crystallize. Digestion of antibodies with the enzyme, pepsin, results in the a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment in which the two arms of the antibody molecule remain linked and comprise two-antigen binding sites. The F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment has the ability to crosslink antigen.\n\n\n“Fv” when used herein refers to the minimum fragment of an antibody that retains both antigen-recognition and antigen-binding sites.\n\n\n“Fab” when used herein refers to a fragment of an antibody that comprises the constant domain of the light chain and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.\n\n\nThe term “mAb” refers to monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n“Liposome” when used herein refers to a small vesicle that may be useful for delivery of drugs that may include the Ang-2 polypeptide of the invention or antibodies to such an Ang-2 polypeptide to a mammal.\n\n\n“Label” or “labeled” as used herein refers to the addition of a detectable moiety to a polypeptide, for example, a radiolabel, fluorescent label, enzymatic label chemiluminescent labeled or a biotinyl group. Radioisotopes or radionuclides may include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, fluorescent labels may include rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors or FITC and enzymatic labels may include horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutical agent or drug” as used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient. Other chemistry terms herein are used according to conventional usage in the art, as exemplified by \nThe McGraw\n-\nHill Dictionary of Chemical Terms \n(Parker, S., Ed., McGraw-Hill, San Francisco (1985)), (incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nAs used herein, “substantially pure” means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more than about 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.\n\n\nThe term “patient” includes human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\nHuman Antibodies and Humanization of Antibodies\n\n\nHuman antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies.\n\n\nOne method for generating fully human antibodies is through the use of XenoMouse® strains of mice that have been engineered to contain up to but less than 1000 kb-sized germline configured fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus. See Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997) and Green and Jakobovits \nJ. Exp. Med. \n188:483-495 (1998). The XenoMouse® strains are available from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.).\n\n\nThe production of the XenoMouse® strains of mice is further discussed and delineated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/466,008, filed Jan. 12, 1990, Ser.

In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more V\nH \ngenes, one or more D\nH \ngenes, one or more J\nH \ngenes, a mu constant region, and usually a second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal.

Additionally, KM™—mice, which are the result of cross-breeding of Kirin's Tc mice with Medarex's minilocus (Humab) mice have been generated. These mice possess the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al., Cloning Stem Cells, (2002) 4:91-102).\n\n\nHuman antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods. Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display (CAT, Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Symphogen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome display (CAT), yeast display, and the like.\n\n\nPreparation of Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies, as described herein, were prepared through the utilization of the XenoMouse® technology, as described below. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed in the background section herein. In particular, however, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published Jun. 11, 1998 and WO 00/76310, published Dec. 21, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThrough the use of such technology, fully human monoclonal antibodies to a variety of antigens have been produced. Essentially, XenoMouse® lines of mice are immunized with an antigen of interest (e.g. Ang-2), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines. These hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. Provided herein are methods for the production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to Ang-1 and Ang-2. Further, provided herein are characterization of the antibodies produced by such cell lines, including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chains of such antibodies.\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of being fused to myeloma cells to generate hybridomas, B cells can be directly assayed. For example, CD19+ B cells can be isolated from hyperimmune XenoMouse® mice and allowed to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Antibodies from the cell supernatants are then screened by ELISA for reactivity against the Ang-2 immunogen. The supernatants might also be screened for immunoreactivity against fragments of Ang-2 to further map the different antibodies for binding to domains of functional interest on Ang-2. The antibodies may also be screened against Ang-1, Ang-3 or Ang-4, other related human chemokines and against the rat, the mouse, and non-human primate, such as Cynomolgus monkey, orthologues of Ang-2, the last to determine species cross-reactivity. B cells from wells containing antibodies of interest may be immortalized by various methods including fusion to make hybridomas either from individual or from pooled wells, or by infection with EBV or transfection by known immortalizing genes and then plating in suitable medium. Alternatively, single plasma cells secreting antibodies with the desired specificities are then isolated using an Ang-1 or Ang-2-specific hemolytic plaque assay (see for example Babcook et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n93:7843-48 (1996)). Cells targeted for lysis are preferably sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) coated with the Ang-2 antigen. In screening for an antibody also able to antagonize Angiopoietin-1 the above methods can equally be used substituting Angiopoietin-2 with Angiopoietin-1.\n\n\nIn the presence of a B-cell culture containing plasma cells secreting the immunoglobulin of interest and complement, the formation of a plaque indicates specific Ang-1/Ang-2-mediated lysis of the sheep red blood cells surrounding the plasma cell of interest. The single antigen-specific plasma cell in the center of the plaque can be isolated and the genetic information that encodes the specificity of the antibody is isolated from the single plasma cell. Using reverse-transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR), the DNA encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of the antibody can be cloned. Such cloned DNA can then be further inserted into a suitable expression vector, preferably a vector cassette such as a pcDNA, more preferably such a pcDNA vector containing the constant domains of immunglobulin heavy and light chain. The generated vector can then be transfected into host cells, e.g., HEK293 cells, CHO cells, and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing transcription, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\nIn general, antibodies produced by the fused hybridomas were human IgG2 heavy chains with fully human kappa or lambda light chains. Antibodies described herein possess human IgG4 heavy chains as well as IgG2 heavy chains. Antibodies can also be of other human isotypes, including IgG1. The antibodies possessed high affinities, typically possessing a Kd of from about 10\n−6 \nthrough about 10\n−12 \nM or below, when measured by solid phase and solution phase techniques. Antibodies possessing a KD of at least 10\n−11 \nM are preferred to inhibit the activity of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2.\n\n\nAs will be appreciated, antibodies can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding particular antibodies can be used to transform a suitable mammalian host cell. Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference). The transformation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.\n\n\nMammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive Ang-2 binding properties.\n\n\nBased on the ability of mAbs to significantly neutralize Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2 activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below), these antibodies will have therapeutic effects in treating symptoms and conditions resulting from Angiopoietin-1 and/or Angiopoietin-2 expression. In specific embodiments, the antibodies and methods herein relate to the treatment of symptoms resulting from Angiopoietin-1 and/or Angiopoietin-2 induced angiogenesis.\n\n\nAccording to another aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antagonist of the biological activity of Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the antagonist comprises an antibody. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antagonist of the biological activity of Angiopoietin-2, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the antagonist comprises an antibody.\n\n\nAnti-Ang-2 antibodies are useful in the detection of Ang-2 in patient samples and accordingly are useful as diagnostics for disease states as described herein. In addition, based on their ability to significantly neutralize Ang-2 activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below), anti-Ang-2 antibodies have therapeutic effects in treating symptoms and conditions resulting from Ang-2 expression. In specific embodiments, the antibodies and methods herein relate to the treatment of symptoms resulting from Ang-2 induced angiogenesis. Further embodiments involve using the antibodies and methods described herein to treat angiogenesis-related diseases including neoplastic diseases, such as, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, thyroid tumor, gastric (stomach) cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nTherapeutic Administration and Formulations\n\n\nEmbodiments of the invention include sterile pharmaceutical formulations of anti-Ang-2 antibodies or antibodies which bind to both Ang-1 and Ang-2 that are useful as treatments for diseases. Such formulations would inhibit the binding of Ang-2 or Ang-1 and Ang-2 to its receptor Tie2, thereby effectively treating pathological conditions where, for example, serum or tissue Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 is abnormally elevated. Anti-Ang-2 antibodies preferably possess adequate affinity to potently neutralize Ang-2, and preferably have an adequate duration of action to allow for infrequent dosing in humans. Anti-Ang-1/Ang-2 antibodies preferably possess adequate affinity to potently neutralize Ang-1 and Ang-2, and preferably have an adequate duration of action to allow for infrequent dosing in humans. A prolonged duration of action will allow for less frequent and more convenient dosing schedules by alternate parenteral routes such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.\n\n\nSterile formulations can be created, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution of the antibody. The antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. Therapeutic antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having an adapter that allows retrieval of the formulation, such as a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\nThe route of antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g., injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intrathecal, inhalation or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems as noted below. The antibody is preferably administered continuously by infusion or by bolus injection.\n\n\nAn effective amount of antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred that the therapist titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or by the assays described herein.\n\n\nAntibodies, as described herein, can be prepared in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This therapeutic composition can be administered intravenously or through the nose or lung, preferably as a liquid or powder aerosol (lyophilized). The composition may also be administered parenterally or subcutaneously as desired. When administered systemically, the therapeutic composition should be sterile, pyrogen-free and in a parenterally acceptable solution having due regard for pH, isotonicity, and stability. These conditions are known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, dosage formulations of the compounds described herein are prepared for storage or administration by mixing the compound having the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers. Such materials are non-toxic to the recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as TRIS HCl, phosphate, citrate, acetate and other organic acid salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) peptides such as polyarginine, proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidinone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN, PLURONICS or polyethyleneglycol.\n\n\nSterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n(20\nth \ned, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)). For example, dissolution or suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as water or naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame, peanut, or cottonseed oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like may be desired. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\nSuitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the polypeptide, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., \nJ. Biomed Mater. Res\n., (1981) 15:167-277 and Langer, \nChem. Tech\n., (1982) 12:98-105, or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., \nBiopolymers\n, (1983) 22:547-556), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON Depot™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).\n\n\nWhile polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated proteins remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for protein stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\nSustained-released compositions also include preparations of crystals of the antibody suspended in suitable formulations capable of maintaining crystals in suspension. These preparations when injected subcutaneously or intraperitonealy can produce a sustained release effect. Other compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibodies. Liposomes containing such antibodies are prepared by methods known per se: U.S. Pat. No. DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1985) 82:3688-3692; Hwang et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1980) 77:4030-4034; EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; 142,641; Japanese patent application 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324.\n\n\nThe dosage of the antibody formulation for a given patient will be determined by the attending physician taking into consideration various factors known to modify the action of drugs including severity and type of disease, body weight, sex, diet, time and route of administration, other medications and other relevant clinical factors. Therapeutically effective dosages may be determined by either in vitro or in vivo methods.\n\n\nAn effective amount of the antibodies, described herein, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical daily dosage might range from about 0.001 mg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer the therapeutic antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or as described herein.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that administration of therapeutic entities in accordance with the compositions and methods herein will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as Lipofectin™), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures may be appropriate in treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is physiologically compatible and tolerable with the route of administration.

(Minneapolis, Minn. Cat. No. 623-AM/CF) was used as an antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against Ang-2 were developed by sequentially immunizing XenoMouse® mice (XenoMouse strains XMG2 and XMG4 (3C-1 strain), Abgenix, Inc. Fremont, Calif.). XenoMouse animals were immunized via footpad route for all injections. The total volume of each injection was 50 μl per mouse, 25 μl per footpad. The first injection was with 2.35 μg recombinant human Ang-2 (rhAng-2, cat #623-AM/CF; lot #BN023202A) in pyrogen-free Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) and admixed 1:1 v/v with 10 μg CpG (15 μl of ImmunEasy Mouse Adjuvant, catalog #303101; lot #11553042; Qiagen) per mouse. The next 6 boosts were with 2.35 μg rhANG-2 in pyrogen-free DPBS, admixed with 25 μg of Adju-Phos (aluminum phosphate gel, Catalog #1452-250, batch #8937, HCl Biosector) and 10 pg CpG per mouse, followed by a final boost of 2.35 μg rhAng-2 in pyrogen-free DPBS, without adjuvant. The XenoMouse mice were immunized on \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n 0, 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, and 24 for this protocol and fusions were performed on day 29.\n\n\nSelection of Animals for Harvest by Titer\n\n\nAnti-Ang-2 antibody titers in the serum from immunized XenoMouse mice were determined by ELISA. Briefly, recombinant Ang-2 (1 μg/ml) was coated onto Costar Labcoat Universal Binding Polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Acton, Mass.) overnight at four degrees in Antigen Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6 NaHCO\n3 \n8.4 g/L). The next day, the plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer (0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in 1×PBS) using a Biotek plate washer. The plates were then blocked with 200 μl/well blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in 1×PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the one-hour blocking, the plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer using a Biotek plate washer. Sera from either Ang-2 immunized XenoMouse mice or naïve XenoMouse animals were titrated in 0.5% BSA/PBS buffer at 1:3 dilutions in duplicate from a 1:100 initial dilution. The last well was left blank. These plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hr, and the plates were then washed 3 times with washing buffer using a Biotek plate washer. A goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) conjugated antibody was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Then the plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer using a Biotek plate washer.\n\n\nAfter washing, the plates were developed with the addition of TMB chromogenic substrate (BioFx BSTP-0100-01) for 10-20 min or until negative control wells start to show color. Then the ELISA was stopped by the addition of Stop Solution (650 nM Stop reagent for TMB (BioFx BSTP-0100-01), reconstituted with 100 ml H\n2\nO per bottle). The specific titer of each XenoMouse animal was determined from the optical density at 650 nm and is shown in Tables 2 and 3 below. The titer value is the reciprocal of the greatest dilution of sera with an OD reading two-fold that of background. Therefore, the higher the number, the greater was the humoral immune response to Ang-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1: 10 mice (XMG2 strain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter 4 injections\n\n\nAfter 6 injections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nReactivity to rhAng-2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMouse ID\n\n\nTiters via hIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-1\n\n\n92,000\n\n\n231,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-2\n\n\n56,000\n\n\n212,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-3\n\n\n73,000\n\n\n331,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-4\n\n\n16,000\n\n\n175,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-5\n\n\n95,000\n\n\n236,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-6\n\n\n27,000\n\n\n119,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-7\n\n\n100,000\n\n\n239,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-8\n\n\n25,000\n\n\n165,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-9\n\n\n68,000\n\n\n136,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO825-10\n\n\n120,000\n\n\n264,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nNC\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPC\n\n\nSensitivity: 10 ng/ml\n\n\nSensitivity: 9 ng/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n* NC = xmg2 strain, ova gp2, fp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n* PC = goat AB, anti-huAng-2 (R&D Systems, Catalog No. AF623) 1 mg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 2: 10 mice (XMG4 strain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter 4 injections\n\n\nAfter 6 injections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nReactivity to rhAng-2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMouse ID\n\n\nTiters via hIgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-1\n\n\n750\n\n\n4,600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-2\n\n\n200\n\n\n5,800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-3\n\n\n500\n\n\n7,400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-4\n\n\n225\n\n\n4,700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-5\n\n\n300\n\n\n5,800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-6\n\n\n550\n\n\n7,400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-7\n\n\n1,600\n\n\n11,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-8\n\n\n45\n\n\n2,400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-9\n\n\n600\n\n\n6,900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nO824-10\n\n\n225\n\n\n2,300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNC\n\n\n<100\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPC\n\n\nSensitivity: 12 ng/ml\n\n\nSensitivity: 8 ng/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n* NC = 3c-1 N128-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n* PC = goat AB, anti-huAng-2 (R&D Systems, Catalog No. AF623) 1 mg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nRecovery of Lymphocytes, B-Cell Isolations, Fusions and Generation of Hybridomas\n\n\nImmunized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the draining lymph nodes harvested and pooled from each cohort. The lymphoid cells were dissociated by grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues and the cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted, and 0.9 ml DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes added to the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely. Using 100 μl of CD90+ magnetic beads per 100 million cells, the cells were labeled by incubating the cells with the magnetic beads at 4° C. for 15 minutes. The magnetically labeled cell suspension containing up to 108 positive cells (or up to 2×10\n9 \ntotal cells) was loaded onto a LS+ column and the column washed with DMEM. The total effluent was collected as the CD90-negative fraction (most of these cells were expected to be B cells).\n\n\nThe fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched B cells from above and nonsecretory myeloma P3×63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC, cat. #CRL 1580 (Kearney et al, J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550) at a ratio of 1:1. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 800×g. After complete removal of the supernatant, the cells were treated with 2-4 mL of Pronase solution (CalBiochem, cat. #53702; 0.5 mg/ml in PBS) for no more than 2 minutes. Then 3-5 ml of FBS was added to stop the enzyme activity and the suspension was adjusted to 40 ml total volume using electro cell fusion solution, (ECFS, 0.3M Sucrose, Sigma, Cat #S7903, 0.1 mM Magnesium Acetate, Sigma, Cat #M2545, 0.1 mM Calcium Acetate, Sigma, Cat #C4705). The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in 40 ml ECFS. This wash step was repeated and the cells again were resuspended in ECFS to a concentration of 2×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\nElectro-cell fusion was performed using a fusion generator (model ECM2001, Genetronic, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). The fusion chamber size used was 2.0 ml, using the following instrument settings:\n\n\nAlignment condition: voltage: 50 V, time: 50 sec.\n\n\nMembrane breaking at: voltage: 3000 V, time: 30 μsec\n\n\nPost-fusion holding time: 3 sec\n\n\nAfter ECF, the cell suspensions were carefully removed from the fusion chamber under sterile conditions and transferred into a sterile tube containing the same volume of Hybridoma Culture Medium (DMEM, JRH Biosciences), 15% FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, pen/strep, OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin) (all from Sigma) and IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were incubated for 15-30 minutes at 37° C., and then centrifuged at 400×g (1000 rpm) for five minutes. The cells were gently resuspended in a small volume of Hybridoma Selection Medium (Hybridoma Culture Medium supplemented with 0.5× HA (Sigma, cat. #A9666)), and the volume adjusted appropriately with more Hybridoma Selection Medium, based on a final plating of 5×10\n6 \nB cells total per 96-well plate and 200 μl per well. The cells were mixed gently and pipetted into 96-well plates and allowed to grow. On \n \nday\n \n 7 or 10, one-half the medium was removed, and the cells re-fed with Hybridoma Selection Medium.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nSelection of Candidate Antibodies by ELISA\n\n\nAfter 14 days of culture, hybridoma supernatants were screened for Ang-2-specific monoclonal antibodies. The ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat. No. 12-565-136) were coated with 50 μl/well of human Ang-2 (2 μg/ml) in Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6, NaHCO\n3 \n8.4 g/L), then incubated at 4° C. overnight. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer (0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS) 3 times. 200 μl/well Blocking Buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in 1×PBS) were added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer three times. 50 μl/well of hybridoma supernatants, and positive and negative controls were added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The positive control used throughout was serum from the Ang-2 immunized XenoMouse mouse, XMG2 Ang-2 \nGroup\n 1, footpad (fp) N160-7, and the negative control was serum from the KLH-immunized XenoMouse mouse, \nXMG2 KLH Group\n 1, footpad (fp) L627-6.\n\n\nAfter incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 μl/well of detection antibody goat anti-huIgGFc-HRP (Caltag, Cat. No. H10507), was added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. In the secondary screen, the positives in first screening were screened in two sets, one for hIgG detection and the other for human Ig kappa light chain detection (goat anti-hIg kappa-HRP (Southern Biotechnology, Cat. No. 2060-05) in order to demonstrate fully human composition for both IgG and Ig kappa. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 μl/well of TMB (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. TMSK-0100-01) were added and the plates allowed to develop for about 10 minutes (until negative control wells barely started to show color). 50 μl/well stop solution (TMB Stop Solution, (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. STPR-0100-01) was then added and the plates read on an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. There were 185 fully human IgG kappa antibodies against Ang-2.\n\n\nAll antibodies that bound in the ELISA assay were counter screened for binding to Ang-1 by ELISA in order to exclude those that cross-reacted with Ang-1. The ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat. No. 12-565-136) were coated with 50 μl/well of recombinant Ang-1 (2 μg/ml, obtained from R&D Systems, Cat. #293-AN-025/CF) in Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6, NaHCO\n3 \n8.4 g/L), then incubated at 4° C. overnight. Under the experimental conditions described here, when the recombinant Ang-1 molecule was immobilized on the ELISA plate, no antibodies were found to bind to Ang-1. However, the counter screening described here has technical limitations. First, the antibodies derive from line materials, but not a cloned hybridoma. Binding signals from a particular clone, which only account for a minor percentage of the line, may fall below the detection sensitivity threshold. Second, certain epitopes in the antigen may be concealed from the antibodies in this experiment due to slight conformational changes induced by immobilization of the antigen. For all of these reasons, the cross-reactivity of each antibody to Ang-1 was further examined using cloned antibodies and a Biacore system (see Example 8). As described in Example 8, one clone (mAb 3.19.3) was in fact found to have strong cross-reactivity to human recombinant Ang-1 (Examples 8, 9 and 12).\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nInhibition of Ang-2 Binding to Tie2\n\n\nAs discussed above, Ang-2 exerts its biological effect by binding to the Tie2 receptor. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibited Ang-2/Tie2 binding were identified by a competitive binding assay using a modified ELISA. The mAbs used were products of micro-purification from 50 ml of exhaustive supernatants of the hybridoma pools that were specific for Ang-2 (see Example 3). 96-well Nunc Immplates™ were coated with 100 μl of recombinant human Tie2/Fc fusion protein (R&D Systems, Inc., Cat. No. 313-TI-100) at 4 μg/ml by incubating overnight at 4° C. The plates were washed four times using Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) with a \nSkan™ Washer\n 300 station (SKATRON). The wells were blocked by 100 μl of ABX-blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween, 0.01% Thimerosal in PBS) for 1 hour.\n\n\nBiotinylated recombinant human Ang-2 (R&D Systems, Inc. Cat. No. BT623) at 100 ng/ml was added in each well with or without the anti Ang-2 mAbs at 100 μg/ml. The plates were incubated at room temperature for two hours before the unbound molecules were washed off. Bound biotinylated Ang-2 was then detected using 100 μl/well of Streptavidin-HRP conjugate at 1:200 by incubating at room temperature for half an hour. After washing twice, the bound Streptavidin was detected by HRP substrate (R&D Systems, Cat. No. DY998). The plates were incubated for 30 minutes before 450 stop solution (100 μl/well, BioFX, Cat #BSTP-0100-01) was added to terminate the reaction. The light absorbance at 450 nm was determined by a Spectramax Plus reader.\n\n\nSoluble recombinant Tie2/Fc fusion protein at 10-fold molar excess to Ang-2 was used as a positive control. At this concentration, Tie2/Fc inhibited binding of Ang-2 to immobilized Tie2 by 80%. With this as an arbitrary criterion, 74 out of 175 Ang-2 binding mAbs showed inhibitory activity. For the convenience of operation, the top 27 neutralizers were selected for subsequent hybridoma cloning.\n\n\nEach hybridoma was cloned using a limited dilution method by following standard procedures. Three sister clones were collected from each hybridoma. For each clone, the supernatant was tested using ELISA binding to human Ang-2 and counter binding to Ang-1, as described above, to ensure that each antibody was only specific for Ang-2. Concentrations of IgG in the exhaustive supernatants were determined, and one clone with the highest yield among the three sister clones from each hybridoma was selected for IgG purification. 0.5 to 1 mg of IgG was purified from each supernatant for further characterization.\n\n\nTo quantitate the inhibitory activities of the mAbs on Ang-2 binding to Tie2, the titer was determined for purified mAbs from the top 27 candidates using a competitive binding assay. Each concentration of the mAb was tested in duplicate. The concentration-response relationship was found by curve fitting using Graphpad Prism™ graphic software (non-linear, Sigmnoid curve). The maximal inhibition (efficacy) and IC\n50 \n(potency) were calculated by the software. Ten monoclonal antibodies that exhibited both relative high efficacy and potency were selected for further investigation. The efficacy and potency of these 10 mAbs are listed in Table 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy and potency of top 10 mAbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClone\n\n\nEfficacy*\n\n\n(μg/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.31.2\n\n\n0.3751\n\n\n0.04169\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.16.3\n\n\n0.3279\n\n\n0.08532\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.86.1\n\n\n0.3844\n\n\n0.1331\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.88.3\n\n\n0.4032\n\n\n0.1557\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.3.2\n\n\n0.3881\n\n\n0.1684\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.103.1\n\n\n0.2317\n\n\n0.3643\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.101.1\n\n\n0.3639\n\n\n0.3762\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.19.3\n\n\n0.3945\n\n\n0.7976\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.28.1\n\n\n0.3892\n\n\n2.698\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.78.3\n\n\n0.2621\n\n\n5.969\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Efficacy is expressed as the ratio of bound Ang-2 with mAbs (30 μg/ml) versus without mAbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nBinning of Antibodies\n\n\nEpitope binning was performed to determine which of the anti-Ang-2 antibodies would cross compete with one another, and thus were likely to bind to the same epitope on Ang-2. The binning process is described in U.S. Patent Application 20030175760, also described in Jia et al., J. Immunol. Methods, (2004) 288:91-98, both of which are incorporated by reference in entirety. Briefly, Luminex beads were coupled with mouse anti-huIgG (Pharmingen #555784) following the protein coupling protocol provided on the Luminex website. Pre-coupled beads were prepared for coupling to primary unknown antibody using the following procedure, protecting the beads from light. Individual tubes were used for each unknown supernatant. The volume of supernatant needed was calculated using the following formula: (n×2+10)×50 μl (where n=total number of samples). A concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was used in this assay. The bead stock was gently vortexed, and diluted in supernatant to a concentration of 2500 of each bead in 50 μl per well or 0.5×10\n5 \nbeads/ml.\n\n\nSamples were incubated on a shaker in the dark at room temperature overnight.\n\n\nThe filter plate was pre-wetted by adding 200 μl wash buffer per well, which was then aspirated. 50 μl of each bead was added to each well of the filter plate. Samples were washed once by adding 100 μl/well wash buffer and aspirating. Antigen and controls were added to the filter plate at 50 μl/well. The plate was covered, incubated in the dark for 1 hour on a shaker, and then samples were washed 3 times. A secondary unknown antibody was then added at 50 μl/well. A concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was used for the primary antibody. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 2 hours at room temperature on a shaker, and then samples were washed 3 times. 50 μl/well of biotinylated mouse anti-human IgG (Pharmingen #555785) diluted at 1:500 was added, and samples were incubated in the dark for 1 hour with shaking at room temperature.\n\n\nSamples were washed 3 times. 50 μl/well Streptavidin-PE at a 1:1000 dilution was added, and samples were incubated in the dark for 15 minutes with shaking at room temperature. After running two wash cycles on the Luminex100, samples were washed 3 times. Contents in each well were resuspended in 80 μl blocking buffer. Samples were carefully mixed with pipetting several times to resuspend the beads. Samples were then analyzed on the Luminex100.

For this purpose, a high-density goat anti-human antibody surface over a CM5 Biacore chip was prepared using routine amine coupling. All the purified mAbs were diluted to approximately 8 μg/ml in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA and 10 mg/mL carboxymethyldextran. Each mAb was captured on a separate surface using a 42-second contact time, and a 5-minute wash for stabilization of the mAb baseline.\n\n\nAng-2 was injected at 90.9 nM over all surfaces for one minute, followed by a 10-minute dissociation. Double-referenced binding data was prepared by subtracting the signal from a control flow cell and subtracting the baseline drift of a buffer injected just prior to the Ang-2 injection. Ang-2 binding data for each mAb were normalized for the amount of mAb captured on each surface, and the normalized, drift-corrected responses for the 27 mAbs were determined.

The fitting model for these samples detected no measurable change in the off-rate over the relatively brief dissociation time and therefore required the k\nd \nto be constant in order to fit the on-rate data. The data for those indicated k\nd\n's also fit well in a simulation with the k\nd \non the order of 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, therefore the interactions may be 10-fold or more stronger than reported above.\n\n\nDissociation data is normally measured 4-6 hours for high-resolution kinetic experiments with mAbs having sub-100 pM affinities. The maximum dissociation time that can be measured without drift artifacts from a captured mAb surface is 20 minutes. Almost negligible signal decay is measured over such a relatively short time with high affinity mabs so the k\nd \nestimate may vary by as much as two orders of magnitude.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nDetermination of Anti-Ang-2 Antibody Affinity Using Biacore Analysis\n\n\nAng-2 Medium/High Resolution Screen with Three Purified Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\nPurified mAbs 5.16, 5.35, and 5.41 were diluted to approximately 8 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Each diluted mAB was then immobilized on a different flow cell surface (CM5 Biacore chip) using routine amine coupling.\n\n\nFor on-rate data acquisition, eight concentrations (2-fold dilutions) ranging from 90.9-0.71 nM of Ang-2 were randomly injected for 90 seconds in triplicate with several buffer injections interspersed for double referencing, followed by a four minute dissociation. The antibody surfaces were regenerated with two 9-second pulses of 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 1.5 after each injection cycle.\n\n\nFor off-rate data acquisition, three 90.9 nM Ang-2 samples in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA were injected as described above and dissociation data was recorded over eight hours. The sample injections alternated with three blank injection cycles. Regeneration was performed as described above.\n\n\nThe data were globally fit to a 1:1 interaction model with mass transport using CLAMP (David G. Myszka and Thomas Morton (1998) “CLAMP©: a biosensor kinetic data analysis program,” TIBS 23, 149-150). The resulting binding constants are shown in Table 7 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAng-2 medium resolution Biacore screen of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 purified monoclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nR\nmax\n \n\n\nk\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\nd \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nd \n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.16\n\n\n36\n\n\n3.41 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n2.77 × 10\n−6\n \n\n\n8.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.35\n\n\n54\n\n\n5.64 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1.87 × 10\n−6\n \n\n\n3.31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.41\n\n\n44\n\n\n4.69 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n 8.31 × 10\n−6\n*\n\n\n17.7*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant signal decay was measured over the 8-hour dissociation time. With the eight hour dissociation data, CLAMP was able to more reasonably estimate the k\nd \nfor each mAb. Here the k\nd\n's for both 5.16 and 5.35 are on the order of 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n\n\nThe cross-reactivity of antibodies to Ang-1 was then investigated by measuring the affinity of the mAbs to Ang-1, as described below in Example 8.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nDetermination of Anti-Ang-1 Antibody Affinity Using Biacore Analysis\n\n\nThe cross-reactivity of antibodies to Ang-1 was further investigated by measuring the affinity of the mAbs to Ang-1. Instead of immobilizing Ang-1, as described in ELISA-based counter-binding (Example 3), Ang-2 mAbs were immobilized to the CM5 Biacore chips, and Ang-1 in solution was injected for the determination of the on-rate and off-rate. Six mAbs, including 3.3.2, 3.31.2, 5.16.3, 5.86.1, 5.88.3, and 3.19.3, were tested in this experiment as described below to determine how strongly they cross-reacted with Ang-1.\n\n\nMedium Resolution Screen of Six Purified Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\nLabel-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or a \nBiacore\n 2000 instrumentation, was utilized to measure antibody affinity to Ang-1. For this purpose, a high-density goat (α-human antibody surface over a CM5 Biacore chip was prepared using routine amine coupling. For developmental experiments, purified mAbs (clones 3.19.3, 3.3.2, 5.88.3, 5.86.1, 3.31.2, 5.16.3) were diluted to approximately 2.5-3.5 μg/ml in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA. The capture level for each mAb was approximately 150 RU. A 5-minute wash followed each capture cycle to stabilize the mAb baseline.\n\n\nA single Ang-1 sample diluted to 87.4 nM in the running buffer was injected for one minute over all capture surfaces. No binding was evident for five mAbs, although Ang-1 was found to bind to mAb 3.19.3. This experiment was repeated by increasing the mAb capture levels to well over 500-600 RU and injecting 380 nM Ang-1 for one minute. The mAb 3.19.3 was again found to bind Ang-1.\n\n\nBecause Ang-1 only showed binding activity towards mAb 3.19.3, the affinity of this mAb to both Ang-1 and Ang-2 was determined. Since Ang-1 displayed a slow off-rate during the above developmental experiments, a medium resolution capture experiment would not have recorded sufficient off-rate data to accurately estimate kd. As a result, the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to mAb 3.19.3 was measured under high-resolution Biacore conditions.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nDetermination of Mab 3.19.3 Affinity for Ang-1 and Ang-2 Using High Resolution Biacore Analysis\n\n\nPurified mAb 3.19.3 was diluted to 12.5 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The mAb was then immobilized on flow cells 1-3 (CM5 Biacore chip) using routine amine coupling, leaving \nflow cell\n 4 as the reference flow cell.\n\n\nFor on-rate data acquisition, eight concentrations (2-fold dilutions) ranging from 39.8-0.31 nM of Ang-1 (in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA) were randomly injected for 90 seconds (100 μL/min. flow rate) in triplicate with several buffer injections interspersed for double referencing, followed by a four minute dissociation. The antibody surfaces were regenerated with a 6-second pulse of 10 mM NaOH after each injection cycle.\n\n\nFor off-rate data acquisition, three 19.9 nM Ang-1 samples were injected as described above and dissociation data was recorded over six hours. The sample injections alternated with three blank injection cycles. Regeneration was performed as described above.\n\n\nThe data were globally fit to a 1:1 interaction model with a term for mass transport included using CLAMP (David G. Myszka and Thomas Morton (1998) “CLAMP©): a biosensor kinetic data analysis program,” TIBS 23, 149-150).\n\n\nANG-2 High Resolution Biacore Study with Purified MAb 3.19.3\n\n\nPurified mAb 3.19.3 was diluted to 12.5 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The mAb was then immobilized on flow cells 1-3 (CM5 Biacore chip) using routine amine coupling, leaving \nflow cell\n 4 as the reference flow cell.\n\n\nFor on-rate data acquisition, eight concentrations (2-fold dilutions) ranging from 30.0-0.23 nM of Ang-2 (in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA) were randomly injected for 90 seconds (100 μL/min. flow rate) in triplicate with several buffer injections interspersed for double referencing, followed by a four minute dissociation. The antibody surfaces were regenerated with a 6-second pulse of 15 mM NaOH after each injection cycle.\n\n\nFor off-rate data acquisition, three 15.0 nM Ang-2 samples were injected as described above and dissociation data were recorded over six hours. The sample injections alternated with three blank injection cycles. Each surface was regenerated with a 6-second pulse of 15 mM NaOH after each long off-rate injection cycle.\n\n\nThe data were globally fit to a 1:1 interaction model with a term for mass transport included using CLAMP (David G. Myszka and Thomas Morton (1998) “CLAMP©): a biosensor kinetic data analysis program,” TIBS 23, 149-150).\n\n\nResults And Discussion: Ang-1 and Ang-2 High Resolution Biacore Study With MAb 3.19.3\n\n\nTwo independent experiments were run with each antigen.

There was no significant dissociation signal recorded for the Ang-2 experiments, so the best off-rate estimate was to hold k\nd \nconstant at 1×10\n−6 \nsec\n−1\n. The long off-rate data for Ang-2 actually displayed an upward trend over the six hours of data acquisition. This trend was repeated on two different sensor chips with two different instruments after both instruments had been subjected to a “super clean” maintenance protocol. In order to more precisely measure the binding affinity of mAb 3.19.3 for Ang-1 and Ang-2, a further experiment (see Example 10) was run to determine the Kd of mAb 3.19.3 towards these antigens.\n\n\nInterestingly, mAb 3.19.3 did not bind to Ang-1 in the ELISA-based binding assay (Example 3), when Ang-1 was immobilized on the ELISA plate. The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that when Ang-1 was immobilized on the surface of plastics, a subtle epitope critical for the binding of mAb 3.19.3 was not exposed appropriately. However, when Ang-1 was in the liquid phase, such as in the Biacore experimental conditions, this epitope became accessible to mAb 3.19.3 and binding occurred.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nDetermination of Affinity of Mab 3.19.3 to Human Ang-2 Using High Resolution Kinexa (Kinetic Expulsion Assay)\n\n\nWhen affinity of mAb 3.19.3 to human Ang-2 was measured using high resolution Biacore (Example 9), it was found that there was no significant dissociation signal. The long off-rate data for Ang-2 shows an upward trend over the six-hour data acquisition. Because of this, the K\nD \nof mAb 3.19.3 binding to human Ang-2 was determined using KinExA technology, with the goal of obtaining a more reliable Kd value. For this purpose, a KinExA 3000 instrument was utilized. Firstly, 1 mL (˜271 μg) of stock Ang-2 (R&D Systems, Inc., Lot #BNO32510A) was buffer exchanged into 1×PBS, pH 7.0 using a 10 mL desalting column (Pierce D-Salt™ polyacrylamide column, 6000 molecular weight cut-off, Lot #GF97965). The concentration of the pooled fractions was determined to be 1.7 μM using the protein concentration determination method described by C. Nick Pace (Pace, et al., \nProtein Science\n, Vol. 4: 2411-2423, 1995). Secondly, 200 mg of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, Lot #206-01) beads were coupled with 450 μL (˜122 μg) of stock Ang-2 overnight at 24° C. The beads were then centrifuged and washed once with blocking buffer (1×PBS, 10 mg/ml BSA), centrifuged again, and then incubated in blocking buffer for one hour at 24° C. After blocking, the beads were diluted in approximately 30 mL of HBS buffer (0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) in a standard KinExA bead reservoir vial and placed on the instrument.\n\n\nK\nD\n-Controlled Titration\n\n\nTwelve solutions containing a mAb 3.19.3 binding site concentration of 25.3 pM were titrated with increasing concentrations of Ang-2. The buffer-exchanged Ang-2 was used for the sample preparations. Each solution had a \ntotal volume 6f\n 25 mL and was allowed to equilibrate for 5 days at ˜24° C. The titration solutions were prepared using volumetric glassware and the Ang-2 concentrations varied from 5.09 nM to 99.3 fM. The KinExA instrument method used for the analysis of these solutions consisted of a bead packing step in which the PMMA beads were packed into a glass capillary, and the equilibrated solutions were flowed through the bead column at 0.25 mL/min for 6 min (1.5 mL) in duplicate. Subsequently, a fluorescently labeled Cy-5 goat anti-human (Fc specific) polyclonal antibody at 3.4 nM was flowed through the bead pack for 1 min at 0.5 mL/min to label the mAb with free binding sites captured on the beads. The fluorescence emission from the bead pack was measured at 670 nm with excitation at 620 nm. The resulting fluorescence measurements were converted into “%free mAb binding site” versus total antigen concentration using the accompanying KinExA software package (version 1.0.3, Sapidyne, Inc.). The resulting K\nD\n-controlled titration curve was fit with the KinExA software to a 1:1 equilibrium isotherm with a drift correction factor included. The value of the K\nD \nthat fit the data optimally was 86.4 pM with low and high 95% confidence limits at 64.3 pM and 98.7 pM, respectively. A mAb-controlled titration curve was not performed.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nBlockage of Ang-2-Induced Tie2 Phosphorylation Ectopically Expressed in HEK293 Cells\n\n\nAs discussed above, Tie2 is an endothelial cell specific receptor tyrosine kinase. In vitro experiments with vascular endothelial cells show that Ang-1 induces Tie2 phosphorylation, whereas, Ang-2 inhibits the receptor phosphorylation induced by Ang-1. However, when Tie2 is expressed ectopically, such as in fibroblasts, Ang-2 is also able to induce Tie2 phosphorylation under certain conditions, including but not limited to, prolonged exposure to Angiopoietin-2 or exposure to high concentrations of Angiopoietin-2.\n\n\nAng-2 induced Tie2 phosphorylation also occurs when the receptor is expressed in HEK293F cells. The ability of anti-Ang-2 mAbs to block Ang-2 induced Tie2 phosphorylation was examined using HEK293F cells transfected with human Tie2 receptor. Plasmid vector pORK/pBS-SK having a Tie2 cDNA was obtained from the ATCC (Cat. No. 69003, Genbank sequence BC033514). The accuracy of the cDNA was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A 3.9 kb fragment containing a 3375 bp cDNA that encodes human Tie2 was removed from the vector by EcoRI digestion. This fragment was subcloned in the proper orientation into a pCR3.1 vector digested with EcoRI following standard procedures. The selected plasmid was amplified and purified by standard protocols.\n\n\nThe Tie2 containing construct obtained by the above procedures was transfected into HEK293F cells by the calcium phosphate transfection method. 1×10\n6 \nHEK293F cells were grown in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 1% gelatin at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. The cells were fed with fresh media for 2-3 hours before transfection. 10 μg of the plasmid DNA was dissolved in 248 mM calcium phosphate solution. Transfection was performed using standard procedures. Stable transfectants were selected by incubation in 0.5 mg/ml G418. Stable transfectants expressing Tie2 were identified by FACS analysis using mouse anti-Tie2 mAb (R&D Cat. No. MAB313) and a goat anti-mouse IgG-PE conjugate antibody (Caltag, Cat. No. M30004-4) for detection.\n\n\nTo perform the Tie2 phosphorylation assay, HEK 293F/Tie-2 transfectants were grown in 60 mm cell culture dishes at a density of 2×10\n6 \ncells/plate with complete medium at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2 \nuntil they reached sub-confluency. The complete medium in each plate was replaced with 2 ml of serum free medium. The cells were incubated for an additional 16 hours. Subsequently, the medium was replaced again with 2 ml of serum-free medium. After an additional 2-hr incubation, the cells were treated with 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma, Cat. No. S 6508) for 20 minutes. The cells were treated with Ang-2 (2, μg/ml) in the presence or absence of mAbs at 100 μg/ml. Treatments were performed in duplicate. A negative control without Ang-2 treatment was included. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold TBS containing vanadate and lysed with 300 μl/plate of cooled NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH7.2, supplemented with 0.15M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1% NP40, 100 U/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM orthovanadate, 10 μM leupeptin and 10 μM pepstatin A), while putting the plates on ice for 10 minutes. The treated cells were scraped from the plates into a microtube pre-chilled on ice.\n\n\nThe cell lysates were sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. in a tabletop microfuge. Supernatants were collected into fresh microtubes, and 1-5 μg of anti-Tie2 mAb (R&D Systems, Inc.) were added to the supernatant, followed by gentle rocking for 2 hours at 4° C. 50 μl of ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein A (PIERCE Cat. No. 20333) was added to the mixture, and incubated for at least 3 hours at 4° C. on a rocking platform. Complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 10 minutes. After carefully removing the supernatant, the complexes were washed twice with the lysis buffer by centrifuging (12,000×g, 4° C.) for 4 minutes. The pellets were re-suspended in 50 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer (Invitrogen, Cat. No. LC-2676) with 1 mM of β-mercaptoethanol or DTT, and boiled for 5 minutes before being centrifuged (12,000×g, 4° C.) for 5 minutes. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes.\n\n\nThe samples were loaded into the wells of an SDS-PAGE gel (e.g., 4-20% Tris-Glycine gel, Invitrogen, Cat. No. EC 6025). Electrophoreses was performed in Tris-Glycine buffer system. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Cat. No. LC 2005) following a standard protocol. Tyrosine phosphorylation was probed with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody at 1 μg/ml (Upstate, Cat. No. 05-321) by incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking, and followed by washing with 1× TBST (TBS with 0.1% of Tween-20) three times. The bound antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, Cat. No. sc-2302) at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by the enhance chemiluminescence reaction using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate system (PIERCE Cat. No. 34075). Subsequently, the blot was stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (PIERCE, Cat. No. 21059) and re-probed with specific antibodies against RTK to verify the quality of sample loading.\n\n\nIt was discovered that when human Tie2 was ectopically expressed in HEK293F cells, autophosphorylation of Tie2 was not detectable. In response to Ang-2 (2 μg/ml) treatment, a significant level of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by a mAb to phosphorylated tyrosine (4G10) from Tie2 immunoprecipitated by the specific mAb. At a concentration of 100 μg/ml, all the anti-Ang-2 mAbs tested showed obvious inhibition of Tie2 phosphorylation, whereas, the isotype control mAb did not have inhibitory effect (\nFIG. 1\n). Monoclonal antibody 5.103.1, which is not shown in \nFIG. 1\n, had a similar inhibitory effect.\n\n\nTo rank the potency of the Ang-2 mAbs to inhibit Ang-2-induced Tie2 phosphorylation in vitro, an ELISA-based quantifiable method to detect Tie2 phosphorylation was established. Briefly, cell lysates were made from HEK293F/Tie2 transfectants that were treated with Ang-2 with the mAbs at various concentrations. Total Tie2 from the lysate was captured in the 96-well ELISA plate that was coated with mouse anti-hTie-2 mAb. The phosphorylated Tie2 was detected using primary antibody 4G10-HRP (purchased from Upstate) and HRP substrate solution. OD at 650 nm was determined by a SpectraMax reader. The concentration-response relationship was found by curve fitting using Graphpad Prism™ graphic software (non-linear, Sigmoid curve). The maximal inhibition (efficacy) and IC\n50 \n(potency) were calculated as shown in \nFIG. 2\n. The EC50 was calculated as shown in below in Table 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb\n\n\nEC50 (μg/ml)\n\n\n95% CI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.19.3\n\n\n0.006\n\n\n0.004 to 0.009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.86.1\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n0.007 to 0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.88.3\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n0.011 to 0.024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.31.2\n\n\n0.043\n\n\n0.029 to 0.064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.3.2\n\n\n0.046\n\n\n0.020 to 0.105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.16.3\n\n\n0.089\n\n\n0.046 to 0.174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.103.3\n\n\n0.095\n\n\n0.046 to 0.199\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.101.1\n\n\n0.733\n\n\n0.487 to 1.105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs reported above, it was found that mAb 3.19.3 cross-reacted with Ang-1. However, the results of initial experiments did not find inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 induced Tie-2 phosphorylation by mAb 3.19.3. It is worthwhile to note that ectopic expression of Tie2 may affect its susceptibility to activation by different ligands, as evidenced by the fact that Ang-2 does not induce Tie2 phosphorylation in HUVECs, whereas, it does induce robust Tie2 phosphorylation when the receptor is ecotopically expressed in HEK293 cells.\n\n\nIn view of these results further experiments were performed to more fully investigate whether mAb 3.19.3 was capable of inhibiting binding of both Ang-1 and Ang-2 to cell-bound Tie2. In addition, inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 induced Tie-2 phosphorylation by mAb 3.19.3 was investigated in more detail as described in Example 12 below.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nmAb 3.19.3 Inhibits Angiopoietin-1 Binding to Tie-2 and Ang-1 Induced Tie2 Phosphorylation\n\n\nThe mAb 3.19.3 cross-reacts with human Ang-1 (Examples 8 and 9). However, initial experiments indicated that mAb 3.19.3 did not inhibit Tie2 phosphorylation induced by Ang-1. The discrepancy may be explained by the following: (1) high concentration of Ang-1, which is far above physiological concentration, may be required to generate robust Tie2 phosphorylation signal; or (2) Ecotopic expression of Tie2 in HEK293 may alter the conformation of Tie2, and thus change its susceptibility to different ligands. To test there hypotheses mAb 3.19.3 was tested in a binding assay where low concentration of Ang-1 or Ang-2 (3 nM) bound to cell surface Tie2. It was found that mAb 3.19.3 inhibited binding of both Ang-1 and Ang-2 in this experiment. Secondly, immortalized endothelial cells (EA.hy926/B3) were used to investigate Ang-1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation. The results of this experiment, as described in more detail below, demonstrate that mAb 3.19.3 inhibits Ang-1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\nHEK293F/Tie2 transfectants were allowed to grow until 95% confluent in culture flasks before being harvested. Cell suspension of 4 million cells/mL in FACS Buffer were prepared, and then aliquoted to a 96-well polypropylene plate with 50 ul per well. The mAb 3.19.3 with indicated concentrations were added into the cell suspension. Subsequently, solutions of recombinant human Ang-1 and Ang-2 were added into the cell suspension, followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 hours. Cells were washed by centrifuging the plate at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes, removing the supernatant by aspirating, and resuspending the cells with 200 ul per well of FACS Buffer. Washing procedures were repeated twice. The cells were then suspended with 100 ul of mouse Anti-6×-Histidine antibody diluted to 2 ug/ml in FACS Buffer, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After washing, the cells were suspended in 100 ul of PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG, which was diluted 1:100 in FACS Buffer, for incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes. The volume of the samples were brought to 300 ul with FACS Buffer, and measured with FACS Calibur.\n\n\nThe results are illustrated in \nFIG. 3\n and summarized in Table 10. As shown, soluble Tie2/Fc dose-dependently inhibited binding of both Ang-1 and Ang-2 by blocking the ligands, whereas, the isotype control mAb, PK16.3.1 had no effect in the binding of either ligand. The mAb 3.19.3 showed concentration dependent inhibition of both Ang-1 and Ang-2. Interestingly, with the potency of Tie2/Fc as a reference, the potency of mAb 3.19.3 to the binding of Ang-2 was higher than that to Ang-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Ang-1 and Ang-2 binding to Tie2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAng-1\n\n\nAng-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTie2/Fc\n\n\n18.73\n\n\n25.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.19.3\n\n\n218.5\n\n\n0.7310\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results indicated that mAb 3.19.3 not only bound to human Ang-1, but also blocked its binding to the receptor Tie2. This was further confirmed by the inhibition of Ang-1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation in immortalized endothelial cells as described below.\n\n\nThe inhibitory activity of the mAb 3.19.3 on Ang-1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation was quantified as follows. The mAb showed an obvious increasing inhibition of Tie-2 phosphorylation with increasing antibody concentration, as shown in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n. A plot of the dose response curve led to the calculation of an IC50 of 99 nM.\n\n\nAngiopoietin-1 Ligand Stimulated Tie-2 Receptor Phosphorylation Assay\n\n\nEA.hy926/B3 cells were seeded into 6 well plates using 2.5×105 EA.hy 926 cells/well in 2 ml volume DMEM; HAT; 10% FCS and incubated for 3 days under standard mammalian cell growth conditions.\n\n\nThe growth medium was replaced with 2 mls of DMEM (with no FCS) and the cells serum-starved for a total of 2 hours. Test compounds were diluted in DMEM; 1% FCS to twice the desired final concentration. After 1 \nhour\n 40 minutes of the serum starvation, the medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 1 ml of test compound dilutions. Similarly, non-compound treated controls were also progressed to provide samples that represent 100% ligand stimulation standards.\n\n\nIncubation was continued for a further 10 minutes after which 100 μl of an 10 mM orthovanadate in DMEM solution was added to each well to obtain a final concentration of 1 mM orthovanadate in each well. The cells were then incubated for the last 10 minutes of the 2 hour serum starvation period.\n\n\nOnce the 2 hour serum starvation period was complete, 1 ml of Angiopoietin-1 (diluted to the appropriate concentration in DMEM and containing 1 mM orthovanadate) was added to each well and incubated at 37° C. for a further 10 minutes.\n\n\nThe 6 well plate(s) were then cooled by placing on an ice cold metal plate (itself kept on ice). The cell medium was removed and the cell layer washed with 5 ml of cold PBS; 1 mM orthovanadate. One ml of ice cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, 0.5% DOC, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 30 μl/ml Aprotinin, 10 μg/ml Pepstatin, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin) was added to each well and left on ice for 10-20 minutes. The cells were scraped off the plate using a cell lifter and the whole lysate solution transfer to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and kept on ice. The samples were then spun for 3 minutes at 13000 rpm at 4° C. and all subsequent steps carried out at 4° C.\n\n\n50 μl of each lysate were kept for the BCA Protein assay (Pierce, Cat. No. 23225) (in low protein binding polypropylene microtiter plates from Greiner). The protein concentration was determined using the standard assay conditions supplied with the kit. A further 800 μl of each sample lysate was transferred to a fresh 2 ml Eppendorf tube in preparation for the immunoprecipitation (IP). 15 μl (3 mg) of anti P-Y (Santa Cruz Cat. No. E2203) were added to the lysates and left to incubate for 2 hours at 4° C. before adding 600 μl of the Magnabind beads (goat anti mouse IgG, Pierce Cat. No. 21354). The Magnabind beads were prepared as follows: The required volume was transferred into 15 ml conical tubes. Tubes were then placed in the presence of a magnetic field and the liquid was removed. Fresh PBS was added using the original volume, and the beads were re-suspended. This process was repeated twice. The lysate-containing solution was then mixed with the beads and the tubes left to rotate overnight at 4° C. on a rotor mixer.\n\n\nThe samples were exposed for about 1 min to the magnet and the liquid carefully removed. 1 ml lysis buffer was added and the tubes rotated for 5 min to wash. The wash steps were repeated twice. The liquid was completely removed and the beads re-suspended in 12 μl of hot (94° C.) 2× Laemmli loading buffer+bME, then left to stand for 15 min at room temperature. The tubes were exposed for 1 min in the magnet, and the liquid which separated from the beads was analyzed on PAGE/SDS gels.\n\n\nThe samples were analyzed using PAGE/SDS gels using 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE/MOPS gels with 15 wells (Novex). The total 12 μl of each immunoprecipitate was loaded per slot. The gels were run at 200 V/120 mA/25 Watts for 55 minutes and then the samples western blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for 1 \nhr\n 30 min at 50 V/250 mA. All blots were then treated with 5% Marvel in PBS-Tween for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed with PBS-Tween\n\n\nRabbit anti Tie-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Cat. No. C1303) was diluted 1:500 in 0.5% Marvel/PBS-Tween and 12.5 mls added to each blot and left at 4° C. overnight. The blots were then washed with PBS-Tween and goat anti rabbit-POD (Dako Cat. No. P 0448) (1:5000 dilution in 0.5% Marvel/PBS-Tween) added to each blot and left for 1 hour at room temperature. The blots were washed with PBS-Tween and each blot developed for 10 minutes using 12.5 mLs (equal volumes of solution A and B) of Supersignal (PIERCE Cat. No. 34080). The blots were transfer to X-Ray cassette and expose to film (5 sec/15 sec/30 sec/60 sec/150 second exposures). \nFIG. 4\n is a Western blot showing the results of this assay. In this system, inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Tie-2 by mAb 3.19.3 was observed.\n\n\nThe images seen on the film for each sample were then evaluated using the FluorS BioRad image analyzer system. The pixel density was measured as OD/mm2 and expressed in percentage volume. The percentage volume results were normalized to 1 mg protein/immunoprecipitation using the protein concentration determined using the BCA assay and the lysate volume of each sample used in the immunoprecipitation. The percentage phosphorylation of each sample was calculated against the 100% phosphorylation value of the untreated control sample on each gel with percentage inhibition of each sample being calculated against the 100% phosphorylation value, which itself represents 0% inhibition). \nFIG. 5\n is a graphical representation of these values, and shows that the IC50 for inhibition of Angiopoietin-1 stimulated Tie-2 phosphorylation is 99 nM.\n\n\nTaken together, these data show that, in this system, the mAb inhibits Angiopoietin-1 induced phosphorylation of Tie-2.\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nStructural Analysis of Ang-2 Antibodies\n\n\nThe variable heavy chains and the variable light chains of the antibodies were sequenced to determine their DNA sequences. The complete sequence information for the anti-Ang-2 antibodies is provided in the sequence listing with nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each gamma and kappa chain combination. The variable heavy sequences were analyzed to determine the VH family, the D-region sequence and the J-region sequence. The sequences were then translated to determine the primary amino acid sequence and compared to the germline VH, D and J-region sequences to assess somatic hypermutations.\n\n\nTable 11 is a table comparing the antibody heavy chain regions to their cognate germ line heavy chain region. Table 12 is a table comparing the antibody kappa light chain regions to their cognate germ line light chain region.\n\n\nThe variable (V) regions of immunoglobulin chains are encoded by multiple germ line DNA segments, which are joined into functional variable regions (V\nH\nDJ\nH \nor V\nK\nJ\nK\n) during B-cell ontogeny. The molecular and genetic diversity of the antibody response to Ang-2 was studied in detail. These assays revealed several points specific to anti-Ang-2 antibodies.\n\n\nAnalysis of 152 individual antibodies specific to Ang-2 resulted in the determination that the antibodies were derived from 21 different germline VH genes, 112 of them from the VH3 family, with 46 antibodies being derived from the VH3-33 gene segment. Tables 11 and 12 show the results of this analysis.\n\n\nIt should be appreciated that amino acid sequences among the sister clones collected from each hybridoma are identical. For example, the heavy chain and light chain sequences for mAb 3.19.3 are identical to the sequences shown in Tables 11 and 12 for mAbs 3.19 and 3.19.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavy chain analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n

described antibody structure in terms of “canonical classes” for the hypervariable regions of each immunoglobulin chain (\nJ Mol Biol\n. Aug. 20, 1987; 196(4):901-17). The atomic structures of the Fab and VL fragments of a variety of immunoglobulins were analyzed to determine the relationship between their amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of their antigen binding sites. Chothia, et al. found that there were relatively few residues that, through their packing, hydrogen bonding or the ability to assume unusual phi, psi or omega conformations, were primarily responsible for the main-chain conformations of the hypervariable regions. These residues were found to occur at sites within the hypervariable regions and in the conserved beta-sheet framework. By examining sequences of immunoglobulins having unknown structure, Chothia, et al. show that many immunoglobuins have hypervariable regions that are similar in size to one of the known structures and additionally contained identical residues at the sites responsible for the observed conformation.\n\n\nTheir discovery implied that these hypervariable regions have conformations close to those in the known structures. For five of the hypervariable regions, the repertoire of conformations appeared to be limited to a relatively small number of discrete structural classes. These commonly occurring main-chain conformations of the hypervariable regions were termed “canonical structures.” Further work by Chothia, et al. (\nNature \nDec. 21-28, 1989; 342(6252):877-83) and others (Martin, et al. \nJ Mol Biol\n. Nov. 15, 1996; 263(5):800-15) confirmed that there is a small repertoire of main-chain conformations for at least five of the six hypervariable regions of antibodies.\n\n\nThe CDRs of each antibody described above were analyzed to determine their canonical class. As is known, canonical classes have only been assigned for CDR1 and CDR2 of the antibody heavy chain, along with CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 of the antibody light chain. The table below (Table 13) summarizes the results of the analysis. The Canonical Class data is in the form of *HCDR1-HCDR2-LCDR1-LCDR2-LCDR3, wherein “HCDR” refers to the heavy chain CDR and “LCDR” refers to the light chain CDR. Thus, for example, a canonical class of 1-3-2-1-5 refers to an antibody that has a HCDR1 that falls into \ncanonical class\n 1, a HCDR2 that falls into \ncanonical class\n 3, a LCDR1 that falls into \ncanonical class\n 2, a LCDR2 that falls into \ncanonical class\n 1, and a LCDR3 that falls into \ncanonical class\n 5.\n\n\nAssignments were made to a particular canonical class where there was 70% or greater identity of the amino acids in the antibody with the amino acids defined for each canonical class. Where there was less than 70% identity, the canonical class assignment is marked with an asterisk (“*”) to indicate that the best estimate of the proper canonical class was made, based on the length of each CDR and the totality of the data. Where there was no matching canonical class with the same CDR length, the canonical class assignment is marked with a “Y.” The amino acids defined for each antibody can be found, for example, in the articles by Chothia, et al. referred to above. Table 13 reports the canonical class data for each of the Ang-2 antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanonical classes of antibodies against Ang-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nCanonical Class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.18\n\n\n1-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.81\n\n\n1-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.66\n\n\n1-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.48\n\n\n1-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.23\n\n\n1-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.33\n\n\n1-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.15\n\n\n1-1-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.3\n\n\n1-1-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.12\n\n\n1-1-4-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.16\n\n\n1-1-4-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.13\n\n\n1-1-4-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n1-1-4-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.32\n\n\n1-1-4-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.37\n\n\n1-1-4-1-Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.30\n\n\n1-2-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.6\n\n\n1-2-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.6\n\n\n1-2-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.34\n\n\n1-2*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.74\n\n\n1-2*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.38\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.28.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.6\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.44\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.28\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.86.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.35.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.35\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.8\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.22\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.15\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.67\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.87\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.10\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.71\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.21\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.80\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.18\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.11\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.26\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.31\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.76\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.17\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.39\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.37\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.22\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.29\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.73\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.12\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.11\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.24\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.3.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.56.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.111\n\n\n1-3-2-1*-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.13\n\n\n1-3-2-1*-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.52\n\n\n1-3*-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.16.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.39.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.103.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.101.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.54.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.83.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.62\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.88.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.40.2\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.109\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.64\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.13\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.3\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.41\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.3.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.31.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.41.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.62.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.108.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.13.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.97\n\n\n1-3-2-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.52.1\n\n\n1-3-2-1-Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.78.1\n\n\n1-3-3-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.60\n\n\n1-3-3-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.43\n\n\n1-3-3-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.90\n\n\n1-3-3-1*-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.42\n\n\n1-3-3-1*-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.11\n\n\n1-3-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.40\n\n\n1-3-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.82\n\n\n1-3-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.18\n\n\n1-3-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.41\n\n\n1-3-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.92\n\n\n1-3-4-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.10\n\n\n1-3-4*-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.14\n\n\n1-3-4-1-5*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.19.1\n\n\n1-3-8*-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.2\n\n\n1-3-8*-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n1-3-8*-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.58\n\n\n1-3-8-1-1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.1\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.2\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.9\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.45\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.17\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.72\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.14\n\n\n1-4*-2-1-Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.115\n\n\n3-1-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.36\n\n\n3-1*-2-1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.2\n\n\n3-1-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.21\n\n\n3-1-8-1-1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.61\n\n\n3-Y-2-1-3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14 is an analysis of the number of antibodies per class.

All human monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) raised against human Ang-2 had bound to non-reduced Ang-2, but not to reduced form, indicating that all mAbs recognize conformational epitopes, which are apparently destroyed upon reduction of the protein.\n\n\nCloning and Expression of Ang1 and Ang-2 Proteins\n\n\nTo better understand the structural basis for interaction of mAbs with Ang-2, a set of chimeric Ang1/Ang-2 molecules were used. This approach takes advantage of the fact that members of the angiogenic family are structurally related. Although Ang-2 and Ang1 show only 60% homology in their protein sequence, both share the same modular structure composed of an amino terminal coiled-coil domain and a carboxyl terminal fibrinogen like-domain.\n\n\nCloning of Human Ang-1 and Ang-2\n\n\nTwo alternatively spliced forms of human Ang-2 cDNAs were amplified from human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC). PCR amplification of HUVEC cDNA using Ang-2 specific primers reveled both the full length Ang-2 (1491 bp) and a 1330 base pain variant Ang-2\n443 \n(Injune et al., (2000) \nJBC \n275: 18550). Ang-2\n443 \nis a variant generated by alternative splicing of exon B and missing part of the coiled-coil domain (amino-acids 96-148). Both Ang-2 cDNAs were cloned into pCR3.1 expression vector and expressed in 293F cells as shown in \nFIG. 6\n. Human Ang-1 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from human breast cell line MDA-MB-231. A 1.5 Kb cDNA was cloned into pCR3.1 expression vector and expression was detected in the supernatant of transiently transfected 293F cells.\n\n\nELISA\n\n\nBinding of the 27 mAbs to supernatants generated from transient transfection of Ang-2 and Ang1 cDNAs was tested using antibody capture ELISA. Ang-2, Ang-2\n443 \nand Ang-1 were bound to an ELISA plate coated with goat polyclonal antibodies against human Ang-2 or Ang-1 (respectively). The binding of the top 27 human monoclonal antibodies was detected with a HRP-conjugated goat anti-human antibody, followed by colorimetric horseradish peroxidase substrate (Enhanced K-Blue TMB substrate Neogen Corporation). The absorbance of each well of the ELISA plates was measured at 450 nm on a microplate autoreader.\n\n\nTransfection of 293F Cells\n\n\n293F human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified eagles medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. 293F cells were transiently transfected using Calcium phosphate. At 72 hours, the medium was harvested and filtered for ELISA and Western Blot analysis.\n\n\nAll 27 antibodies were shown to bind specifically Ang-2/Ang-2\n443 \nantigens. No cross reactivity was detected with human Ang-1. Amino acids 96-148 in the coiled-coil domain of Ang-2, which are missing in the Ang-2\n443 \nprotein sequence, were excluded as the binding domain for each of the 27 antibodies.\n\n\nConstruction of Ang-1/Ang-2 Chimeric Molecules\n\n\nRestriction cleavage sites common in human Ang-1 and Ang-2 genes were used for construction of In-frame fusion Angiopoietin chimeric proteins.\n\n\nFour constructs were made: Human Ang-1/2 BsmI, Ang-2/1BsmI, Ang-1/2SspI and Ang-2/1 SspI. All proteins were expressed and secreted in detectable levels measured by ELISA assay using polyclonal antibodies against human Ang-1 and Ang-2.\n\n\nThe Amino acid joining points are at the following positions:\n\n\nBsmI-117(Ang-2)/119(Ang-1)\n\n\nSspI-353(Ang-2)/354(Ang-1)\n\n\nThe difference of one amino acid is due to the presence of 497 residues in the human Ang-1 compared to 496 residues in the human Ang-2. All constructs were expressed in 293F cells, and detected by goat anti-human polyclonal antibodies against Ang-1 and Ang-2. The top 27 antibodies were tested for their ability to bind chimeric Ang-1/2 molecules. All 27 antibodies showed a similar pattern of binding to the Ang-1/2BsmI construct only. The results of these experiments indicate that the binding domain for all antibodies is between residues 117-496, most likely in the fibrinogen binding domain, where the epitope is disrupted in the SspI fusion Ang proteins around amino acid 353.\n\n\nConstruction of Mouse/Human Ang-2 Chimeric Molecules\n\n\nSince Ang-2 shares 55% amino acid identity with Ang-1, it was difficult to find a common restriction site to be used for cloning of chimeric molecules. Mouse and human Ang-2 are more similar, having about 85% sequence homology. Mouse Ang-2 cDNA cloned in the pCMCsport expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen. The 27 selected antibodies were tested for their immunoreactivity with recombinant mouse Ang-2. Six out of the 27 cross reacted with mouse Ang-2 with 100% of their immunoreactivity on human Ang-2, indicating that the murine antigen retains most of the immunoreactivity of human Ang-2 (Data are summarized in Table 16).\n\n\nThe human-Mouse chimeric system was chosen for epitope mapping based on the findings that most antibodies bind specifically to the human Ang-2 antigen and do not cross react with mouse Ang-2. Various cDNA constructs of Ang-2 were generated and cloned into a mammalian expression vector.\n\n\nConstructs of Mouse/human Ang-2 were made using the common StuI restriction site, located in the fibrinogen-binding domain, with the amino acid joining point at residue 311. All mAbs specific to the human Ang-2 were able to bind to the Mouse/Human Ang-2 StuI, indicating that the binding domain is in the fibrinogen-binding domain between residues 311-496. In order to narrow down the binding domain, a new construct was prepared in which the human fragment StuI-TfiI replaced the mouse sequence in the mouse Ang-2 cDNA. (\nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\nAll antibodies specific to human Ang-2 showed a positive ELISA signal, with 15-100% of their immunoreactivity on human Ang-2. The binding domain of two antibodies with a unique VH gene usage 5.35.1 (VH3-20) and 5.28.1 (VH3-43) as shown in Table 17, was mapped to a region between amino-acids 310-400.\n\n\nAntibodies that cross reacted with mouse Ang-2 were expected to show 100% reactivity and could not be mapped using Mouse/human chimeric constructs.\n\n\nSite Directed Mutagenesis\n\n\nIn order to define the important residues involved in the binding site of different antibodies, a few residues of Human Ang-2 were mutated, and screened against the entire panel of antibodies for binding by ELISA assay.\n\n\nBecause direct binding detected by ELISA is insensitive to small and moderate differences in affinity, large changes in binding observed after substitution of single amino acid probably identify key sites that interact with the antibody. In addition, polyclonal antibodies against human Ang-2 maintain 100% reactivity with each construct, indicating that the mutagenesis procedure did not introduce any broad structural changes across the Ang-2 molecule. Two independent changes of Val to Met in position 345 (V345M) and His to Gln at position 375 (H375Q) were ignored by all 27 antibodies, indicating that these residues are not reactive, or that the changes in the conformational epitopes require more than single amino acid substitution. Changing of two residues at positions 365 and 367 dramatically changed the binding of single antibody, Mab 5.35.1. Sequence analysis of 5.35.1 showed the unique usage of VH3-20 and unique CDR3 on both the heavy and light chains. All fusion points of Ang-2 chimeric molecules and point mutations are highlighted in \nFIG. 8\n. \nFIG. 9\n is an amino acid sequence comparison of mouse Ang-1 (SEQ ID NO: 5), human Ang-1 (SEQ ID NO: 2), mouse Ang-2 (SEQ ID NO: 4), and human Ang-2 (SEQ ID NO: 3). The arrowhead shows the cleavage site for hydrophobic leader sequences. The arrows define the limits of the coiled-coil and fibrinogen like domains. The solid circles show the conserved cysteine residues (image taken from Maisonpierre et al., 1997, \nScience \n277:55).\n\n\nBinding data to all Ang-2 molecules is summarized below in Table

alignment of VH genes to a germ line database. The software also evaluates D elements, reading frame, N region insertion, P nucleotide addition, nucleotide loss and CDR3 length. Analysis of 27 individual antibodies specific to CR64 yielded only 7 germline VH genes, 10 of them from the same VH1 family. Selection of neutralizing antibodies showed that antibodies expressing same Ig V\nH \nand in some cases same V\nH\nDJ\nH \nrearrangements and that pairs of H and L chain were conserved. This finding suggests that, for any given epitope, only a few members of the germ line repertoire are used to form the corresponding paratope, and for each antigenic epitope a limited number of L- and H-chain genes can pair to form a specific paratope.\n\n\nRecurrent usage of similar V\nH\n, V\nK \nand complementary determining region (CDR) structures by different monoclonal antibodies is linked to the fact that all Ang-2 neutralizing activity is restricted to the fibrinogen like domain, and is in agreement with work published by Procopio et al (1999, \nJBC \n274: 30196), showing that the effect of Ang-2 on Tie2 is linked to the Fibrinogen-like domain. The epitope mapping data indicates that the monoclonal antibodies bind Ang-2 through a broad interface that includes most of the fibrinogen like domain.\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nDetermination of Cross-Reactivity with Mouse Ang-2\n\n\nThe cross-reactivity of the anti-human Ang-2 mAbs to mouse Ang-2 was tested by ELISA. For this purpose, a mouse Ang-2 expression vector was constructed, and eukaryotic cells were transfected transiently to produce mouse Ang-2.\n\n\nThe mouse Angiopoietin-2 (mAng-2) expression construct was obtained from Research Genetics, a distributor of the I.M.A.G.E consortium (see world wide web at image.llnl.gov). Mouse Ang-2 cDNA (GenBank Accession No. BC027216, IMAGE:3494566) was derived from the library NCI_CGAP_Lu29, which is a lung tumor library. The cDNA was cloned into the pCMV-SPORT6 expression vector (Invitrogen Carlsbad, Calif.) through SalI(5′) and NotI(3′) sites and contained the full length mouse Ang-2 (mAng-2) open reading frame of 496 amino acids, as well as the 5′ and 3′ untranslated flanking regions for a total of 2471 base pairs.\n\n\nTen μg of the above mAng-2 plasmid was transfected into HEK293F cells using the calcium phosphate method. Approximately, 1×106 HEK293F cells were seeded on a 10 cm tissue culture plate on the previous day. The medium was changed after 5 hours or overnight transfection and the cells were grown for another 2-3 days before the supernatants containing the secreted mAng-2 protein were collected. The expression of mAng-2 was confirmed by ELISA using a polyclonal antibody obtained from R&D Systems (catalog No. AF623).\n\n\n96-well Nunc Immplates were coated with conditioned-medium collected from HEK293F/mouse Ang-2 transfectants, 100 μl in each well. The plates were incubated at 4° C. overnight, followed by washing four times using Phosphate Buffer Saline with a Skan Washer 300 station (SKATRON). The wells were blocked by 100 μl of ABX-block buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween, 0.01% Thimerosal in PBS) for 1 hour. Anti-Ang-2 mAbs with appropriate concentrations and diluted in the blocking buffer were added into the wells with a volume of 100 μl/well, and incubated at room temperature for at least 1 hour. The mAbs and each of their dilutes were tested in duplicate. After washing twice, the bound mAbs were detected by goat anti-human Fc-HPPO-conjugated antibody (Caltag, Code H 10507) at 1/1,000 dilution at room temperature for an hour. To set up the detecting chromagenic reaction, 100 μl of TMB substrate (TMB-microwell, BioFX, Cat. No. TMSK-1000-01) was added after washing the wells three times using PBS. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes before 650 stop solution (100 μl/well, BioFX, Cat. No. BSTP-0100-01) was added to terminate the reaction. The light absorbance at 650 nm was determined by a Spectramax Plus reader.\n\n\nThe top 27 neutralizing mAbs were tested in this assay. The light absorbance demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies 3.19.3, 3.38, 5.2.1, 5.52.1, 5.56.1, and 5.78.1 were capable of binding to mouse Ang-2 under the experimental conditions. For confirmation, each binding antibody was titered by ELISA. The \nmean OD\n 650 nm (±S.D.) values were plotted against Log concentration of mAbs (μg/ml) is shown in \nFIG. 10\n. The clones 5.2.1, 5.28.1, 3.19.3 and 3.31.2 are shown in the figure. Monoclonal antibodies 5.2.1 and 3.19.3 bound mouse Ang-2 in a dose-dependent manner, reaching saturation at about 10 μg/ml (\nFIG. 10\n). The binding curves of these two mAbs were typical Sigmoidal dose-response relationship curves. Dose-dependency and saturation was not observed in the antibody concentration range tested, except for clones 5.2.1 and 3.19.3. Based on this result, it appears that only mAbs 5.2.1 and 3.19.3 have cross-reactivity to mouse Ang-2.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nInhibition of Murine Ang-2 Binding to Human Tie2\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody 3.19.3 was selected for further testing of its ability to inhibit the binding of mouse Ang-2 to human Tie2. For this purpose, an ELISA plate was coated with 4 μg/ml of hTie2/Fc (R&D Systems, Inc.) at 100 μl/well, and the wells were blocked as routine at 4° C. overnight. The recombinant mouse Ang-2 (mAng-2) in the culture supernatant of the 293T/mAng-2 transfectants described above was employed. 100 μl of mAng-2 containing supernatant with mAb 3.19.3 at various concentrations was added into the pre-coated wells, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr.\n\n\nAs a control, recombinant human Ang-2 (R&D Systems, Inc.) mixed with the antibody was also included. Each concentration of the mAb was tested in triplicate. The bound mouse and human Ang-2 were detected using a goat anti-human Ang-2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.) that cross-react with mouse Ang-2, coupled with a secondary rabbit anti-goat IgG-HRP. OD650 was determined 30 min after the HRP substrate was added. It was discovered that mAb 3.19.3 inhibited binding of both human and mouse Ang-2 to human Tie2 in a dose-dependent manner (\nFIG. 11\n).\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nDetermination of Cross-Reactivity with Monkey Vasculature\n\n\nBecause Ang-2 is specifically expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells, these cells from monkeys were immunohistochemically stained with anti-Ang-2 antibodies as a way to indirectly determine whether each antibody cross-reacted with monkey Ang-2.\n\n\nThe top 10 neutralizing mAbs selected as described in Example 4 (Table 4) were examined in this experiment using endothelial cell-rich ovarian tissue from monkeys. Completely dried 6 μm frozen monkey (Cynomolgus macaque) ovary tissue sections were fixed with 4° C. acetone for 5 minutes. After washing the slides three times with PBS, the endogenous peroxidase of the tissues was blocked with 0.3% of H\n2\nO\n2 \nfor 10 minutes. Subsequently, the tissues were washed with PBS and blocked with 10 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG Fab for 15 minutes. The tissue sections were washed again with PBS followed by treatment with 10% normal goat serum for 10 minutes. After draining the serum, each of the 10 anti-Ang-2 mAbs (10 μg/ml) were applied to the sections and incubated for 2 hours. The bound Ang-2 mAbs were detected with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-human IgG for 15 minutes followed by incubation with peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 minutes. Staining was performed using AEC-substrate system (DAKO, Cat. No. 3464) under microscopic observation for optimal result.\n\n\nAll 10 mAbs were found to stain the angiogenic vascular endothelial cells among the ovary tissue; whereas, the isotype control mAbs did not stain. This demonstrated that the 10 mAbs from Table 4 would cross react with monkey Ang-2.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nMab 3.19.3 Inhibits In Vivo Angiogenesis in Matrigel Plug Assay\n\n\nTo evaluate the in vivo anti-angiogenic potential of anti-Ang-2 monoclonal antibodies, a Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay was conducted. MCF-7 cells were found to produce Ang-2 when cultured in vitro, or implanted in an immunodeficient mouse as a xenograft. When MCF-7 was incorporated into Matrigel and implanted subcutaneously into nude mice, robust vascular in growth into the gel was found. To establish the Matrigel plug model, 6-8 week old female BALB/c/nu/nu mice, with body weights ranging from 18 to 20 g (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were employed. A total of 0.5 mL of Matrigel containing 2×10\n6 \nMCF-7 cells, with or without Ang-2 antibodies, or control agents (including Matrigel alone, Tie2/Fc, IgG2 and IgG4 isotype controls, and anti-VEGF mAb), were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of the nude mice. Five mice were used for each test group. All the mAbs tested were adjusted to a concentration of 100 μg/ml.\n\n\nAfter seven days, Matrigel plugs were harvested and scored for blood vessel density. For this purpose, cervical dislocation of mice under deep anesthesia was performed. The Matrigel plugs were exposed through removal of the covering skin flap. The Matrigel plugs were then removed and digital images were then recorded. The Matrigel plugs were resected carefully and cut into two parts. One part was snap frozen in TissueTek and the other fixed in buffered formalin. Both parts were then embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Three 5 to 7 μm thick sections from each mouse were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were then examined under a phase contrast microscope. Representative photomicrographs were recorded [two frames (100× and 400×)] and endothelial cell and blood vessel infiltration was recorded.\n\n\nThe frozen Matrigel plugs were sectioned (10 μm sections) in a Cryocut microtome. Two independent sections per mouse were made and used for staining. Sections were blocked with BSA (0.1%) and then treated with monoclonal antibody reactive to mouse. CD31 conjugated to Phycoerythin (dilutions as recommended by the manufacturer). After thorough washings, sections were mounted under anti-fading reagent (Vecta Shield) and observed under a UV microscope using a red filter. Representative Digital images were captured (two images at 100× and 200× magnification). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Immunofluorescence images of CD31 staining were analyzed by a Skeletinization program. Data were processed to provide mean vessel density, node and length for each group. The results can be found in \nFIGS. 12A and 12B\n, which show the effect of anti-Ang-2 antibodies on the number of blood vessels ends (\nFIG. 12A\n) and blood vessel length (\nFIG. 12B\n).\n\n\nThis experiment demonstrated that, in comparison with Matrigel alone, MCF-7 cells that were incorporated in the Matrigel were able to induce a significant level of angiogenesis. The induced angiogenesis could be inhibited by a positive control anti-VEGF antibody. The angiogenesis was also significantly inhibited by soluble recombinant Tie2/Fc protein, suggesting that Ang-2 produced by MCF-7 cells plays a role in the angiogenesis in this model. By binding to any Ang-2, the Tie2/Fc would effectively reduce the level of Ang-2 that is exposed to the MCF-7 cells.\n\n\nIt is not clear how the IgG2 isotype negative control antibody, PK16.1.3, impacted angiogenesis, although this antibody was also found to occasionally interfere with tumor growth in some xenograft models (data not shown). The IgG4 isotype control antibody did not have any effect on the angiogenesis in this model. As seen in \nFIGS. 12A and 12B\n, clones 5.88.3, 3.3.2, 3.19.3 and 5.28.1 significantly inhibited angiogenesis (P<0.05, t-test performed by VasculoGen), while others had lesser effects.\n\n\nIt is well established that Ang-2 is expressed by endothelial cells in the tumor, and thus has been considered as a autocrine angiogenic factor. However, Ang-2 has also been found to be expressed by many types of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Except 3.19.3, the mAbs tested here do not cross-react with mouse Ang-2. In this in vivo model, the mAbs only neutralized human Ang-2 produced by the MCF-7 cell, but not the mouse Ang-2. The inhibitory effect of these mAbs suggests that tumor expressed Ang-2 can be a paracrine angiogenesis factor. The overall anti-angiogenic activity of the mAb was partially attributable to the neutralization of the tumor Ang-2, in addition to neutralization of vascular endothelium expressed Ang-2.\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\nDetermination of the Therapeutic Efficacy of Mab 3.19.3 in A431 Preventional Xenograft Model\n\n\nAnti-Ang-2 mAb clone 3.19.3 not only bound to mouse Ang-2, but also inhibited binding of mouse Ang-2 to human Tie2. The anti-tumor activity of this monoclonal antibody was tested in a mouse xenograft model of human skin epidermoid carcinoma by using the A431 cell line.\n\n\nA431 cells were cultured in flasks as routine until the cells reached sub-confluence. Immunodeficient 6-8 week old female mice (Balb/c/nu/nu) were employed for model development. The A431 cells were harvested and suspended in Matrigel. A cell suspension containing 5×10\n6 \ncells was injected intradermally into the flank of the mice. The mice were randomized into different groups, each containing 11 mice. On the same day, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg of mAb 3.19.3, or isotype control antibody, and twice per week thereafter. The dimensions of each tumor were measured twice per week. The volume of the tumor was calculated as: Volume=Length×(Width)\n2\n×0.5 (cm\n3\n).\n\n\nAs illustrated in \nFIG. 13\n, mAb 3.19.3 significantly delayed A431 xenograft tumor growth. The average tumor volume of the isotype control group reached about 1.5 cm\n3 \nat the end of the experiment, whereas the growth rate of the treated group significantly slowed after \nDay\n 10, and was about 0.5 cm\n3 \nat the end. At Day 23, the volume ration of T/C (Treatment/Control) is ⅓, indicating a 66% inhibition of the growth.\n\n\nThe results suggest that at the dosage used in this experiment, by binding to mouse Ang-2 and blocking the binding of this ligand to its receptor Tie2, mAb 3.16.3 was able to significantly delay the growth of A431 xenograft in nude mice. It is likely that the anti-tumor effect of the monoclonal antibody is due to inhibiting angiogenesis in the host, as demonstrated by the Matrigel plug assays. Using the Microvessel Density (MVD) in the tumor as a pharmacodynamic marker, the mechanism of action with respect to anti-angiogenesis is further demonstrated in Example 22.\n\n\nThe mechanism of action of mAb 3.19.3 may not be limited to its blockage of Ang-2/Tie2 association and consequent signaling. As indicated in Example 7, this mAb is also found to bind to Ang-1 and block binding of Ang-1 to Tie2. Interestingly, the mAb also blocks Ang-1-induced Tie2 phosphorylation. It is known that Ang-1 is involved in vessel maturation. When comparing the potency of mAb 3.19.3 for its inhibition in the binding of Ang-1 versus Ang-2 to Tie2 (Example 12), it is apparent that mAb 3.19.3 is predominantly an Ang-2 antagonist. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is possible that dual blockage of signaling from Ang-2 and Ang-1 impairs angiogenesis and consequently tumor growth.\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\nmAb 3.19.3 Inhibits Tumor Growth in Established Xenograft Models\n\n\nAng-2 is upregulated by angiogenic endothelial cells, and is correlated to progression of many types of tumor. It is reasonable to postulate that a monoclonal antibody that blocks binding of Ang-2/Tie2 association will be able to inhibit angiogenesis, and therefore, inhibit the tumor growth. In this experiment, the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-Ang-2 mAb was demonstrated. Since mAb 3.19.3 cross-reacts and neutralizes mouse Ang-2/Tie2 signaling, this mAb was chosen to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of inhibiting tumor growth.\n\n\nTo test whether anti-Ang-2 mAb 3.19.3 also inhibits established tumor, and tumors other than A-431, the human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo xenograft model was employed. Doses of Mab 3.19.3 at 0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg were administered twice per week intraperitoneally. The treatments did not start until the tumors were established with an average volume of 0.2 cm\n3\n. On these established tumors, mAb 3.19.3 also demonstrated an inhibitory effect in comparison with the isotype control. \nFIG. 14A\n shows that 79% inhibition at 0.5 and 2 mg/kg (p values are 0.022 and 0.027, respectively) was achieved, and 75% inhibition on tumor growth were found (p=0.006) at 10 mg/kg.\n\n\nThe tumor growth inhibitory effect was reproduced in an additional xenograft model, human colon adenocarcinoma SW480, which was allowed to grow to an average volume of 0.2 cm\n3\n. Although at 0.5 mg/kg the mAb 3.19.3 was not found to have a significant effect, at both 2 and 10 mg/kg, the mAb inhibited tumor growth by 60% (p=0.003 and 0.006 respectively) at Day 53 after tumor implantation (\nFIG. 14B\n).\n\n\nIn summary of the above results, anti-Ang-2 mAb 3.19.3 significantly inhibited tumor growth in the three models tested. Interestingly, both LoVo and SW480 express human Ang-2. However, two other mAbs that have no mouse Ang-2 cross-reactivity did not show significant inhibitory activity on tumor growth (data not shown), despite the fact that human Ang-2 was expressed by the tumor cells. These results imply that an antagonist of the host Ang-2 is required to block angiogenesis and tumor growth.\n\n\nAs discussed above, Mab 3.19.3 cross-reacts with Ang-1. However, the potency of mAb 3.19.3 on Ang-1/Tie2 association was far lower than that on Ang-2/Tie2 association (Example 12). For this reason, it is reasonable to conclude that the therapeutic efficacy seen in these models is predominantly due to Ang-2 antagonism. However, blockage of Ang-1 in vivo in the models could not be completely excluded. During the entire course of the experiments, no obvious toxicity effect, such as weight loss or bleeding, was observed.\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\nIn Vivo Efficacy of mAb 3.19.3 in Additional Tumor Xenograft Models\n\n\nThe anti-tumor activity of the 3.19.3 monoclonal antibody was tested in mouse xenograft models of human cancer by using 9 different tumor cell lines.\n\n\nColon adenocarcinoma (Lovo, SW480, Colo205, HT29, HCT116), epidermoid carcinoma (A431), lung carcinoma (Calu-6) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) cells were cultured in flasks as routine until the cells reached sub-confluence. Immunodeficient 7-10 week old female mice were employed for model development. The cells were harvested, suspended in Matrigel, and then injected subcutaneously into each mouse. The mice were then randomized into cohorts containing 10-12 mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg of mAb 3.19.3, or isotype control antibody, and twice per week thereafter. For all experiments, isotype control antibody treatment was included. The dimensions of each tumor were measured twice per week. The volume of the tumor was calculated as: Volume=Length×(Width)\n2\n×0.5 (cm\n3\n). Graphical comparisons of tumor growth inhibition is shown for HT29 (\nFIG. 15A\n) and Calu6 (\nFIG. 15B\n) xenografts.\n\n\nAs seen in Table 16, mAb 3.19.3 showed significant activity in all 7 xenograft subcutaneous models tested and both orthotopic models with non-optimized dose and schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of in vivo efficacy of mAb 3.19.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n% Inhibition\n\n\n% Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTumor \nmodels\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSubQ Xenografts\n \n \n \n \n\n\n2 mg/\nkg\n \n\n\n10 mg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ntwice weekly\n\n\ntwice \nweekly\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nColo205\n \n \n \n \n\n\n35\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA431\n\n\n43\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHT29\n\n\n N.D.\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCalu6\n\n\nN.D\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHCT116\n\n\nN.D\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOrthotopic models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMCF7\n\n\n 35*\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMDA-MB-231\n\n\n50\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP < 0.05 in all cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Growth inhibition not statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN.D.—not determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MDA-MB-231 tumor tissue was analyzed via CD31+ vessel staining density. CD31 staining density was measured by threshold and by manual grid counting methods. Eleven tumors per group and at least 20 images per tumor were analyzed. As seen in \nFIG. 15C\n, treatment of mice with 3.19.3 antibody decreased the density of CD31 staining by 40% compared to a control IgG antibody. This was statistically significant with both counting methods, threshold (p<0.015) and manual grid counting (p<0.00004) by 1-tailed T-test. Similar CD31+ vessel counts were made on ex-vivo tissue for the Colo205 and HCT116 xenografts. These samples also exhibited a similar significant reduction in CD31+ vessels.\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\nUses of Anti-Ang-2 Antibodies for the Treatment of Angiogenesis Related Diseases\n\n\nTo determine the in vivo effects of anti-Ang-1 and anti-Ang-2 antibody treatment in human patients with various solid tumors, human patients are dosed periodically with an effective amount of anti-Ang-1 and anti-Ang-2 antibody. At periodic times during the treatment, the human patients are monitored to determine whether tumor growth is inhibited. Following treatment, it is found that patients undergoing treatment with the anti-Ang-1 and anti-Ang-2 antibody in comparison to patients that are not treated have relative improvements in one or more of the following including but not limited to smaller tumors, delayed time to progression or longer time of survival.\n\n\nExample 24\n\n\nUse of Anti-Ang-2 Antibodies as a Diagnostic Agent\n\n\nDetection of Ang-2 Antigen in a Sample\n\n\nAn Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of Ang-1 or Ang-2 antigen in a sample may be developed. In the assay, wells of a microtiter plate, such as a 96-well microtiter plate or a 384-well microtiter plate, are adsorbed for several hours with a first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against Ang-1 and Ang-2. The immobilized antibody serves as a capture antibody for any of the antigen that may be present in a test sample. The wells are rinsed and treated with a blocking agent such as milk protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.\n\n\nSubsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing the antigen, or with a solution containing a standard amount of the antigen. Such a sample may be, for example, a serum sample from a subject suspected of having levels of circulating antigen considered to be diagnostic of a pathology.\n\n\nAfter rinsing away the test sample or standard, the wells are treated with a second fully human monoclonal anti-Ang-1 and anti-Ang-2 antibody that is labeled by conjugation with biotin. A monoclonal or mouse or other species origin might also be used. The labeled anti-Ang-1 and anti-Ang-2 antibody serves as a detecting antibody. After rinsing away excess second antibody, the wells are treated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a suitable chromogenic substrate. The concentration of the antigen in the test samples is determined by comparison with a standard curve developed from the standard samples.\n\n\nThis ELISA assay provides a highly specific and very sensitive assay for the detection of the Ang-1 and Ang-2 antigen in a test sample.\n\n\nDetermination of Ang-2 Antigen Concentration in Patients\n\n\nA sandwich ELISA is developed to quantify Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels in human serum. The two fully human monoclonal anti-Ang-2 antibodies from the sandwich ELISA, recognizes different epitopes on the Ang-2 molecule. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies of mouse or other species origin may be used. The ELISA could be but is not necessarily performed as follows: 50 μL of capture anti-Ang-2 antibody in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO\n3\n, pH 9.6) at a concentration of 2 μg/mL is coated on ELISA plates (Fisher). After incubation at 4° C. overnight, the plates are treated with 200 μL of blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in PBS) for 1 hour at 25° C. The plates are washed (3×) using 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS (washing buffer, WB). Normal or patient sera (Clinomics, Bioreclaimation) are diluted in blocking buffer containing 50% human serum. The plates are incubated with serum samples overnight at 4° C., washed with WB, and then incubated with 100 μL/well of biotinylated detection anti-Ang-2 antibody for 1 hour at 25° C. After washing, the plates are incubated with HRP-Streptavidin for 15 minutes, washed as before, and then treated with 100 μL/well of o-phenylenediamine in H\n2\nO\n2 \n(Sigma developing solution) for color generation. The reaction is stopped with 50 μL/well of H\n2\nSO\n4 \n(2M) and analyzed using an ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. Concentration of Ang-2 antigen in serum samples is calculated by comparison to dilutions of purified Ang-2 antigen using a four parameter curve fitting program.\n\n\nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\n\n\nAll references cited herein, including patents, patent applications, papers, text books, and the like, and the references cited therein, to the extent that they are not already, are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nEQUIVALENTS\n\n\nThe foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention.
